8070145 deciphered isaac newtons greatest paradox none other than the unified field theory of bible prophecy
8070146 is the view that the church is the new or true israel that has permanently replaced or superseded israel as the people of god
8070147 the acceptance or rejection of supersessionism may also influence how one views the modern state of israel and events in the middle east
8070148 we believe that the international church has superseded for all times national israel as the institution for the administration of divine blessing to the world
8070149 as the institution for the administration of divine blessing to the world
8070150 declared that the church abrahams spiritual seed had replaced national israel in that it had transcended and fulfilled the terms of the covenant given to israel which covenant israel had lost because of disobedience
8070151 the church completely and permanently replaced ethnic israel in the working out of gods plan and as recipient of old testament promises addressed to israel
8070152 the consensus of the church from the middle of the second century a d to the present day with few exceptions
8070153 misunderstanding of it colours the churchs attitude to judaism and contributes to anti semitism
8070154 in spite of the many attributes characteristics prerogatives of the latter which are applied to the former the church is not called israel in the nt the continuity between israel and the church is partial and the discontinuity between israel b c and its continuation a d is partial
8070155 the bulk of israels scriptures are indecisive for the formation of christian doctrine
8070156 in addition to narrowing the thematic focus of the hebrew scriptures to the problem of sin and redemption the standard model also foreshortens the hebrew scriptures into a temporal sense as perceived through the lens of the standard model the hebrew scriptures do not relate a story that extends indefinitely into the future
8070157 the first factor is the diminishing emphasis upon the eschatological dimensions of the christian faith
8070158 the doctrine of replacement theology reflects a wide range of christian thinking
8070159 from utterly malignant anti jewish hatred to simple misunderstanding and misapplication of biblical texts
8070160 but if some of the branches were broken off and you being a wild olive were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree do not be arrogant toward the branches but if you are arrogant remember that it is not you who supports the root but the root supports you
8070161 the coming of the kingdom of god through jesus the messiah has transformed and reinterpreted all the promises and prophecies in the old testament jesus the messiah who lived died and was raised from death in the land has opened the kingdom of god to people of all races making all who follow him into one new humanity ephesians 2 15 nrsv
8070162 while the church is said to be a partaker in israels promises in the new testament nowhere is she said to be a taker over of israels promises
8070163 replacement theology is just plain bad news for both the church and israel

8070165 dr horn has convinced me of a frightening supernatural reality that i never anticipated nephilim stargates is excellently researched and thoroughly fascinating i read it from cover to cover in one night those that do the same should probably switch on as many lights in their house as possible and not be alone at the time
8070166 horn has inside knowledge of a demonic cabal that may be controlling some of the worlds leading governments in addition horn believes that the fallen angels who sired the nephilim may be the unseen puppetmasters chilling

8070175 he doesnt does he my brother was a christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to jesus to heal him how is this jesus good hmmm can you answer that one
8070176 thats right god made satan didnt he tell me son is there evil in this world
8070177 evils everywhere isnt it and god did make everything correct
8070178 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principle that our works define who we are then god is evil
8070179 is there sickness immorality hatred ugliness all these terrible things do they exist in the world
8070180 who created them there is still no answer suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace in front of the classroom
8070181 science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you have you ever seen jesus
8070182 have you ever actually felt your jesus tasted your jesus or smelt your jesus have you ever had any sensory perception of jesus christ for that matter
8070183 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist what do you say to that son
8070184 and that is the problem science has with god there is no evidence only faith
8070185 you can have lots of heat even more heat super heat mega heat unlimited heat white heat a little heat or no heat but we dont have anything called cold we can hit 458 degrees below zero which is no heat but we cant go any further than that there is no such thing as cold otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest 458 degrees every body or object is susceptible to study when it transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 458 f is the total absence of heat we cannot measure cold heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy cold is not the opposite of heat sir just the absence of it
8070186 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and it is called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word in reality darkness isnt if it were you would be able to make darkness darker wouldnt you
8070187 yes professor my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed
8070188 you argue that there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cant even explain a thought it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood either one to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life just the absence of it
8070189 now tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey
8070190 have you ever witnessed evolution with your own eyes sir
8070191 since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that the process is an ongoing endeavor are you not teaching your opinion sir
8070192 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student let me give you an example of what i mean
8070193 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
8070194 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors brain felt the professors brain touched and smelled the professors brain no one appears to have done so so according to the established rules of empirical stable demonstrable protocol science says that you have no brain with all due respect sir so if science says you have no brain how can we trust your lectures sir
8070195 now you accept that there is such a thing as faith and in fact faith exists with life
8070196 of course there is we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
8070197 evil does not exist sir or at least it does not unto itself evil is simply the absence of god it is just like darkness and cold a word that man has created to describe the absence of god god did not create evil evil is what happens when man does not have gods love in his heart its like the cold that comes when there is no heat or darkness that comes when there is no light
8070198 we won some gold medals we made our quota it was a great honor to compete for the peoples republic but now we must return to the gymnastic mines
8070199 i was going to use that time to use the 15 yaun i made from endorsing chinese gymnastics and purchase the new jonas brothers record
8070200 but my dad said i was too young so i bought season 1 of spongebob squarepants but having square pants is illegal in the peoples republic i have to buy the chinese equivilent spongebob maopants the pants are both red and regular shaped just how my mother makes them at the levis factory
8070201 we arent allowed to move up to making pommel horses until we are 16 i mean until were older oh well there goes my 5 minute break
8070202 yo pac attack i know all about your struggles dawg

8070205 top 5 covers fo esquire that didnt quite make the cut
8070206 come on they wanted bud to do all his own stunts we had an agreement that it wouldnt get out of hand but when the money started rolling in and the pressure really started to build well lets just say that shaking paws just doesnt mean what is used to in hollywood
8070207 as far as im concerned giving children human growth hormone to children or dogs is bad
8070208 oh sure blame my client for being an animal that wants to perform at his highest level for his millions of adoring fans go ahead and blame him for wanting to give an audience their moneys worth but dont sit here and judge buddy because my client had to be at peak athletic condition he had to jump over an entire f ing football team in one take can you imagine the strain that puts on a dogs body no you cant so why doesnt every body just back off and go interview those dogs from mike vicks house huh people paid 8 50 to see rob schneider pretend to be an animal for an hour and a half my client is a better athlete and a better actor than rob schneider so i ask you whos the real criminal here
8070209 i dont know i never been dog fighting in my life you gonna have to ask ron mexico about that sh
8070210 the more lebrons we have the less i have to do

8070212 ridiculous idea we brought larry hughes in to try and win a championship you know how much money that wasted that didnt turn out well at all i had a meeting with team officials and we put it to a vote it was decided that we just needed more lebron james on the team if we ever wanted to win i mean he is the only player that has been decent on the cavs since brad daugherty went down with back problems
8070213 look guy we brought in ben wallace and wally szerbiak to try and make things better let me reiterate that we felt wally szerbiak would make our team better yeah we brought in wally szerbiak not 2002 all star wally szerbiak we got the i couldnt guard a guy with lead boots wally szerbiak the guy was a marginal forward when he was in his prime a defensive liability since he was in middle school and a decent shooter but only when he has at least 10 feet between himself and the closest defender you know who else thought wally szerbiak would make their team better the minnesota timberwolves and to date they have won exactly 0 championships and 0 division titles i dont think that is a coincidence
8070214 i dunno at this point were kinda putting all our eggs in the lebron basket but i may give steven hawking a ring this afternoon
8070215 guess what crazy carl i was on those apollo space missions yeah i used all that money i made from endorsing those jurassic park rides at universal to go to the moon and guess what the other astronauts i went with were homosexual man thats right a dinosaur went to space with a bunch of gay astronauts set that straight

8070225 the exalted imperial hill in county meath ireland where high kings and tyrants once reigned in celtic mythology
8070226 let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also and whither i go ye know and the way ye know
8070227 and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and shewed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal and had a wall great and high and had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written thereon which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of israel on the east three gates on the north three gates on the south three gates and on the west three gates and the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb
8070228 and there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light and they shall reign for ever and ever
8070229 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely
8070230 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field
8070231 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it
8070232 he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful
8070233 jesus said unto him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions
8070234 no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon
8070235 lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
8070236 and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully and he thought within himself saying what shall i do because i have no room where to bestow my fruits and he said this will i do i will pull down my barns and build greater and there will i bestow all my fruits and my goods and i will say to my soul soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry but god said unto him thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward god
8070237 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth
8070238 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
8070239 then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was an hungred and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me
8070240 blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you
8070241 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
8070242 but jesus called them unto him and said ye know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many
8070243 and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily i say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward
8070244 and jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life but many that are first shall be last and the last first
8070245 but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him
8070246 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
8070247 we needed to be able to talk about the features with a sense of humor because the iphone is one of the most desired products that has come out in a long time we needed a platform that we can talk about the features without being an infomercial

8070275 only 12 have died throughout the country which is a very low figure if we compare it with the deaths produced by respiratory illnesses caused by the pneumococcal bacteria
8070276 the trials were authorized when enriques brother juan carlos smith was provincial health minister
8070277 if you cant beatem on the basketball court beatem in the parking lot on the way out
8070278 i dont understand it he should have been able to fetch that many tennis balls i dont care what the so called experts say about how much strain a golden retriever can handle ive always thrown him 5000 balls a day and even knowing what i do now would continue to throw him at least 5000 balls a day because thats what he liked and thats what it took for him to win after games i used to make kerry wood come over and throw about 300 tennis balls as far as he could to help train the dog for the physical demands of a competition as excruciating as the pdc
8070279 what do you know youre not a veterinarian are you some sort of dog expert no youre a sports reporter what would you know about dogs then thats like a doctor telling me that pitchers arm is being over used i mean hes a doctor where the hell does he get off telling me to do my job he doesnt know baseball he knows doctoring i dont tell him how to perform tommy john surgery and he shouldnt decide when i should take my pitchers out of the game its that simple he sticks with the scalpel and ill stick to the bats

8070287 everyone knew it was just a matter of time ive seen all the red bull gives you wings commercials during sports center it makes dogs fly angels fly old ladies can fly to heaven and smack their husbands that damn stuff makes genies come to life
8070288 that was just like in the commercial what if a fan had been drinking colt 45 and that big ass blue bull would have come crashing through the ivy they could have gone bull for bull that would have been sick oh man what if billy dee williams would have come crashing through the wall and given me a hug holy crap that would have been better than 10 swimsuit models throwing out the first pitch
8070289 maybe the market to get more red bull then after that he probably just flew back home
8070290 it was grow wings and fly away or he was gonna get so amped on caffeine that hed throw his arm completely off his body over home plate and into the first row someday soon this was probably best case scenario
8070291 you bet your ass were gonna start calling him sanka

8070294 anything that puts money in the pockets of basketball owners come playoff time is ok by the nba or the
8070295 its a good thing that someone like roger goodell wasnt in charge of the nba or otherwise i might not get the chance to be a part of the playoffs this year you know things like public and personal safety arent half as important as a championship ring i mean a ring is a ring and a human life being extinguished in an alcohol fueled car crash well humans springing up everyday in hospitals all over the place i can buy a human being on the black market for straight cash son but a championship ring only comes around once a year its all about the bling and the ring in the nba oh and getting away with handfuls of misdemeanors

8070300 i wouldnt be able to pick out a fairleigh dickenson knight in a police lineup even if he was in full uniform and the rest of the people in the lineup were albino midgets dressed in powder blue tuxedos and wearing neon pink wigs i still believe id have trouble making that call

8070317 one of the largest actions at a convention in history
8070318 the country is celebrating one hundred years of freedom one hundred years too soon
8070319 in the middle of a whirlwind 2008 convention protests movement and movements
8070320 all the indicators that make it our way make it seem like theyre in crisis mode
8070321 the fact that we are looking to out of the state agencies with these few days to go tells me that the ball was dropped
8070322 youre not going to see anybody in a uniform at the xcel energy center
8070323 just as we routinely do in state emergencies the national guard is available in the event that additional manpower equipment or capability is needed
8070324 due to the national special security event status there are more than 1 000 minnesota national guard troops dedicated to assist the minnesota national guard is a partner in a support role with local state and federal law enforcement during the republican national convention in the twin cities
8070325 the new york police department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
8070326 my question is why did the nypd send over 100 police in riot gear along with vehicles to block the street and disrupt the flow of morning rush hour traffic all to stop a legal peaceful protest when there are far more important matters they could be pursuing and why did they fight us in court so doggedly when they knew the evidence proved that we were arrested without any police orders to leave
8070327 we hope our victory helps convince the city to stop violating peoples rights as a matter of policy and stop wasting taxpayers money doing so
8070328 it should also serve as a reminder that washingtons illegal war in afghanistan and iraq is also being fought at home against its own citizens and in the name of war profiteers like carlyle and halliburton we intend to continue our resistance until this stops
8070329 why would anybody store a substantial amount of dope in a stolen car parked at a hotel
8070330 if we presume that iraq is an occupied country which it is according to international law the occupier must establish security there i read in a weblog run by one of my pro government journalist friends that all of the plans and schedules related to the iranian president had been coordinated with the iraqis and not the americans i can remember that during my visit to baghdad when we went to the green zone the americans decided to inspect us they made everyone get out of the vehicles and they used sniffer dogs to inspect the vehicles we were classed as the guests of the iraqi government and we didnt expect such treatment even the head of the iraqi prime ministers protocol tried to stop the us soldiers from doing such a thing but to no avail the interesting part is that the americans have to provide part of the iraqi prime ministers security coalition forces are present there dressed with the forces official uniform baghdad international airport is controlled by the americans its a joke to say that even a bird would be able to fly into this airport without the americans knowing during his captivity saddam hossein was imprisoned in this airport so its a joke to say that the americans were unaware of the iranian delegations entry and departure from that country it has been said that the president has said that the iranian delegation did not even visit baghdads green zone and had to sleep in a place outside this area this isnt strange because both the iraqi president and abd al aziz residents are situated outside the green zone its like cracking a joke if we say that the americans didnt know anything about the iranian delegations schedule this is because as far as establishing security at that level is concerned the iraqi forces work under the supervision of their american comrades the security team has a duty to protect the president naturally this duty becomes more difficult during visits to places such as iraq and afghanistan because providing security there is out of the hands of the iranian presidents security team however its even funnier to describe such comings and goings which actually wouldnt take place without the consent of the occupiers and the iraqi government as security brilliance and say that they still are awed about how we left iraq
8070331 ma vie cest de la merde et je vous emmerde
8070332 not a day goes by without a supervisory or human rights organization talking about or presenting a report on the condition of iranian journalists and media
8070333 not interested i was approached to be a clothes designer once i said are you crazy why would you even consider that and they said well you have a name there are so many good designers so why would i put my name on clothes when i never wanted to do it
8070334 i think thats where the difference between my shoes and other shoes i constantly recast look at them reshape its not only a design its a shoe meaning if it has to be corrected 10 times it will be corrected
8070335 been married 47 years we havent always had the most money but at least we didnt argue
8070336 the question is that did they the victors of wwii ask for the world nations and governments permission before granting themselves the veto right are they happy about the fact that some of these powers such as the us and britain are able to continuously bully the world people and make unilateral decisions if we make the false presumption that at that time the world people and nations agreed with this today new generations have come which have their own particular opinion towards these special privileges
8070337 the people of various countries such as japan south korea and germany dont like the idea of us forces being based in their homeland if the us government has any doubts it can seek the views of these countries people by holding of a free referendum

8070419 then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father take your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world
8070420 then the righteous will answer him lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink
8070421 the king will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
8070422 then he will say to those on his left depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
8070423 they also will answer lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and did not help you
8070424 he will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me

8070431 they send me the most mail and keep me updated on everything thats going on at the school
8070432 im being recruited by wide receiver coach david nichol and hes a great guy
8070433 i like how he seems really interested to get to know me and the kinds of things i like to do we dont just talk about football
8070434 its really laid back over there the people are all great and easy to talk to
8070435 it was nice and the weather is always good there but it definitely got hot
8070436 i really love the campus and the environment at berkeley the city is great but im not really looking at them anymore my sister said that its a hard school to graduate from and i know that they are a great school but i want to go where ill be able to focus a bit more on football

8070438 id like to take a few early visits and see how the teams do i want to see how they all look and how they play its really not going to make a difference if they are winning or not but i just want to see how id fit in
8070439 the goal was to get back walking around and running
8070440 they never said kicking i told them that if i can pretend that i can run im going to pretend that i can kick and last year we did it
8070441 everyone told me it was 53 yards sometimes you get to the point where you just look at where the hash is and you get a mental picture and by the end of it you get guys telling you it was a 53 yarder
8070442 i didnt kick the ball before fall camp now i can hit the 50s its not a matter of going through trials anymore
8070443 hes one of the more courageous guys ive been around
8070444 i might have to shake it really fast for five minutes to get it to pop and then i can walk again
8070445 at times it can be flat out ridiculous to handle
8070446 ten or 15 kicks and im ready to go in the game thats all ive got in the tank

8070448 you have to put it out of your head im just going to let my leg swing and its going to do what its going to do
8070449 weve kicked a lot in this camp and it hasnt locked up yet

8070477 menurutku im ketika itu merupakan induk seluruh kelompok tanzhim islam di dunia arab karena im lah yang paling tua dan yang melahirkan berbagai kelompok setelahnya segala bentuk penyimpangannya pun bersumber dari dalam im sendiri
8070478 tali keimanan yang terkokoh adalah berloyal karena allah dan memusuhi karena allah cinta karena allah dan benci karena allah
8070479 sesungguhnya setelah mencintai allah k dan rasul nya maka wajib mencintai wali wali allah k dan memusuhi musuh musuh nya
8070480 sesungguhnya telah ada suri tauladan yang baik bagimu pada ibrahim dan orang orang yang bersamanya ketika mereka berkata kepada kaum mereka sesungguhnya kami berlepas diri dari kamu dan dari apa yang kamu ibadahi selain allah kami ingkari kekafiran mu dan telah nyata permusuhan dan kebencian antara kami dan kamu selama lamanya sampai kamu mau beriman kepada allah semata
8070481 sesungguhnya penolong kamu hanyalah allah rasul nya dan orang orang yang beriman yang mendirikan shalat dan menunaikan zakat seraya mereka tunduk kepada allah dan barangsiapa yang mengambil allah rasul nya dan orang orang yang beriman sebagai penolongnya maka sesungguhnya pengikut agama allah itulah yang pasti menang
8070482 muhammad itu adalah utusan allah dan orang orang yang bersamanya sangatlah keras terhadap orang orang kafir namun berkasih sayang terhadap sesama mereka
8070483 wahai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu menjadikan orang orang yahudi dan nashrani sebagai pemimpin pemimpin mu sebagian mereka adalah pemimpin bagi sebagian yang lain barangsiapa di antara kamu yang menjadikan mereka sebagai pemimpin maka sesungguhnya orang itu termasuk golongan mereka sesungguhnya allah tidak memberi petunjuk kepada orang orang yang dzalim
8070484 wahai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu menjadikan musuh ku dan musuhmu sebagai teman teman setia
8070485 wahai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu jadikan bapak bapak dan saudara saudaramu sebagai pemimpin pemimpinmu jika mereka lebih mengutamakan kekafiran di atas keimanan dan barangsiapa di antara kamu menjadikan mereka sebagai pemimpin maka mereka itulah orang orang yang dzalim
8070486 kamu tidak akan mendapati suatu kaum yang beriman kepada allah dan hari akhir saling berkasih sayang dengan orang orang yang menentang allah dan rasul nya sekalipun orang orang itu bapak bapak anak anak saudara saudara ataupun keluarga mereka
8070487 mari kita saling tolong menolong dalam perkara perkara yang disepakati dan saling toleran dalam perkara perkara yang diperselisihkan
8070488 im getol sekali mendengungkan slogan mereka yang amat terkenal di kalangan kelompok kelompok dan ormas ormas islam mari kita saling tolong menolong dalam perkara perkara yang disepakati dan saling toleran dalam perkara perkara yang diperselisihkan sebuah slogan yang diluncurkan dalam upaya memegang tali kendali umat dan menggiring segala laju permasalahan untuk kepentingan mereka
8070489 dalam mengaplikasikannya pen tidak ada upaya pembenahan atau pembersihan hal hal negatif ataupun meluruskan penyimpangan yang telah menggurita di tengah tengah kelompok pergerakan islam hingga akhirnya penyimpangan itu pun pen bercokol dengan kokohnya di seluruh penjuru dunia faktor penyebabnya adalah terjatuhnya mayoritas mereka ke dalam sikap ekstrim berlebihan ketika menerapkan slogan tersebut
8070490 ribut terus orang kafir sudah sampai ke bulan kita masih ngurusi khilafiyyah
8070491 untuk itu kami tetapkan bahwa permusuhan kami dengan yahu di bukanlah permusuhan agama karena al qur an telah menganjurkan untuk berga bung dan berkawan dekat dengan mereka dan islam merupakan syariat kemanusiaan sebelum menjadi syariat kaum tertentu islam pun telah memuji mereka dan men jadikan antara kita dengan mereka keter kaitan yang kuat
8070492 kami memerangi orang orang yahudi bukan karena urusan aqidah akan tetapi karena urusan tanah kami memerangi mereka bukan karena statusnya sebagai orang orang kafir akan tetapi karena mereka merampas tanah palestina
8070493 untuk itu aku melihat bahwa sekaranglah saatnya memberi peringatan dan membuka jendela jendela agar sinar mentari dan udara segar bisa masuk ke lorong lorong jamaah im yang telah pengap dan membusuk aromanya dan juga agar pengalaman hidupku bersama mereka dapat menjadi pelajaran berharga bagi para pemuda untuk tidak gegabah dalam mencari jalan hidupnya mempertim bangkan secara matang ke mana kakinya hendak dilangkahkan dan tidak mudah hanyut dalam memberikan loyalitas dan ketaatannya pada siapapun karena allah k telah mengaruniakan kita akal fikiran sebagai kehormatan bagi anak manusia tidaklah sepantasnya kita menyia nyiakannya agar tidak mudah dijadikan bulan bulanan oleh siapapun dan bergerak di bawah slogan apapun
8070494 ya wajib untuk saling tolong menolong dalam perkara perkara yang disepakati berupa kebenaran dakwah kepada kebenaran tersebut dan memper ingatkan umat manusia dari apa yang dilarang allah k dan rasul nya adapun saling toleran dalam perkara yang diperselisihkan maka tidak bisa dibenarkan secara mutlak bahkan harus dirinci yaitu di saat perkara tersebut termasuk masalah ijtihad yang tidak ada dalilnya secara jelas maka tidak boleh di antara kita saling mengingkari sedangkan bila perkara tersebut jelas jelas menyelisihi nash nash al qur an dan as sunnah maka wajib diingkari dengan hikmah nasehat dan diskusi dengan cara terbaik
8070495 merekalah orang yang pertama kali menyelisihinya kami yakin bahwa penggalan pertama pen dari slogan tersebut benar yaitu mari kita saling tolong menolong dalam perkara perkara yang disepakati ini tentunya dipetik dari firman allah k
8070496 slogan mereka mari kita saling tolong menolong dalam perkara perkara yang disepakati ini benar adapun dan saling toleran dalam perkara perkara yang diperselisihkan maka ini harus dirinci bila termasuk perkara ijtihad yang memang dibolehkan berbeda maka hendaknya kita saling toleran dan tidak boleh ada sesuatu di hati karena perbedaan tersebut adapun bila termasuk perkara yang tertutup pintu ijtihad maka kita tidak boleh toleran kepada orang yang menyelisihinya dan diapun harus tunduk kepada kebenaran jadi bagian pertama benar sedangkan bagian akhir harus dirinci
8070497 selaras dengan sejarah lama maka kamipun berkeinginan untuk membentangkan tangan tangan kami dan membuka telinga dan hati kami untuk setiap seruan yang mempersatukan agama agama dan mendekatkan antar pemeluknya serta menghilangkan sebab sebab perpecahan dari hati hati mereka
8070498 untuk itu kami menetapkan bahwa permusuhan kami dengan yahudi bukanlah permusuhan agama karena al qur an telah menganjurkan untuk bergabung dan berkawan dekat dengan mereka dan islam merupakan syariat kemanusiaan sebelum menjadi syariat kaum tertentu islam pun telah memuji mereka dan men jadikan antara kita dengan me reka keterkaitan yang kuat
8070499 kami memerangi orang orang yahudi bukan karena urusan aqidah akan tetapi karena urusan tanah kami memerangi mereka bukan karena statusnya sebagai orang orang kafir akan tetapi karena mereka merampas tanah palestina
8070500 islam bukanlah agama yang memerangi agama nashrani bahkan mengakui dan memuliakan agama nashrani islam tidak membedakan antara muslim dan nashrani
8070501 boleh bagi seorang muslim untuk menjadi yahudi atau nashrani seperti halnya mereka yahudi dan nashrani dibolehkan untuk menjadi muslim
8070502 tidak boleh bagi seorang muslim untuk mengkafirkan yahudi dan nashrani
8070503 pada th 1940 an sesuai apa yang kuingat sayyid al qummi tokoh syiah mengunjungi im di markas besarnya saat saat al imam asy syahid hasan al banna pen berjuang keras untuk mempersatukan seluruh madzhab kami pun bertanya kepadanya hasan al banna pen tentang perbedaan antara ahlus sunnah dan syiah maka dia melarang kami untuk masuk ke dalam masalah masalah riskan semacam ini
8070504 sejak terbentuknya lembaga pendekatan antara madzhab madzhab islam yang diprakarsai al imam al banna dan al imam al qummi kerjasama antara im dengan syiah pun terus berlangsung yang akhirnya membuahkan kunjungan al imam nuwab shafawi tokoh syiah ke kairo pada tahun 1954 m
8070505 dan itu bukan hal aneh karena manhaj prinsip kedua kelompok sama sama mendukung kerja sama tersebut
8070506 ketika hasan al banna wafat warisan pemikiran yang busuk ini diambil oleh seluruh petinggi im dan diterapkan di negerinya masing masing sebagaimana yang dilakukan umar at tilmisani mursyid aam pimpinan umum im di mesir musthafa di syria hasan at turabi di sudan al ghanusyi di tunis fathi yakan di lebanon dan al maududi di pakistan
8070507 sudah sepatutnya bahkan seharusnya bagi pengikut dai tersebut hasan al banna pen untuk tidak merealisasikan perkataannya slogan di atas pen yang berujung pada toleransi terhadap kelompok kelompok sesat bahkan yang paling sesatnya semacam syiah rafidhah dan hendaknya memperhatikan penerapan kaidah cinta karena allah k dan benci karena allah k berloyal karena allah k dan memusuhi karena allah k yang tidak ada ruang toleransi bagi orang orang yang menyimpang lagi sesat dalam perkara perkara yang menyelisihi ahlus sunnah wal jamaah
8070508 writers never want to work never they all find any excuse not to sit down and look at an empty sheet of paper or a blank monitor the rooms too hot or too cold they have to go to the toilet pencils need sharpening the typewriter needs a new ribbon the keyboard needs cleaning the pictures on the wall need straightening the wastebasket needs to be emptied or its lunchtime
8070509 i have been known to exclaim when presented with my next step
8070510 imagination is more important than knowledge for knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand while imagination embraces the entire world and all there ever will be to know and understand
8070511 imagination is everything it is the preview of lifes coming attractions
8070512 sesungguhnya kita berada pada masa persembunyian besar mahdi dan telah lewat masanya lebih dari 1 200 tahun sekarang sesungguhnya hukum hukum islam dan undang undang syariat apakah akan dibiarkan dan ditinggalkan sampai masanya muncul supaya selama selang waktu persembunyian yang panjang masanya ini orang orang menjadi tanpa beban mereka berada dalam kebebasan semau mereka maknanya bahwa syariat islam hanya untuk waktu yang terbatas dalam kurun waktu 1 atau 2 abad saja dan ini adalah termasuk penghapusan syariat islam yang paling jelek yang kami tidak sependapat dengannya demikian pula tidak seorang muslim pun sependapat
8070513 apa yang disebutkan oleh khomeini bahwa keyakinan al ghaibah persembunyian al mahdi pada akhirnya mengarah kepada penghapusan syariat mereka ini adalah pendapat yang benar yang allah subhanahu wa taala tampakkan melalui lisannya untuk allah subhanahu wa taala tegakkan hujjah atas mereka orang orang syiah

8070518 whether you can make words mean so many different things
8070519 theyve a temper some of them particularly verbs theyre the proudest adjectives you can do anything with but not verbs however i can manage the whole lot of them impenetrability thats what i say
8070520 i meant by impenetrability that weve had enough of that subject and it would be just as well if youd mention what you mean to do next as i suppose you dont mean to stop here all the rest of your life

8070522 seorang pejuang islam yang mati syahid di tiang gantungan tirani mesir dikatakan sesat
8070523 syaikh maududi menampilkan pemikiran filsafat barat dari buku al hukumah al kulliyah dengan dibungkus pemikiran islam
8070524 sesungguhnya perkara yang menyakinkan dalam dien ini adalah bahwasanya tidak akan tegak di hati ini akidah dan tidak pula dalam kehidupan dunia kecuali dengan mempersaksikan bahwasanya laa ilaha illallah yaitu laa hakimiyata illa lillah tidak ada kehakiman kecuali untuk allah hakimiyah yang berujud qadla dan qadar nya sebagaimana terwujud dalam syariat dan perintahnya
8070525 yaitu tidak ada sekutu bagi nya dalam penciptaan dan ikhtiar
8070526 allah yang maha tinggi sebutannya rabb kamu wahai muhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam adalah yang berhak untuk diibadahi yang tidak layak peribadatan itu diberikan kecuali kepadanya dan tidak ada yang boleh diibadahi kecuali dia
8070527 yaitu yang menyendiri dengan uluhiyah dan tidak ada yang berhak diibadahi kecuali dia sebagaimana tidak ada penguasa yang menciptakan apa yang dikehendakinya dan memilih sekehendaknya kecuali dia
8070528 bahwasanya mereka orang orang arab dahulu telah mengetahui dengan bahasa mereka apa makna ilah dan makna laa ilaha illallah mereka mengetahui bahwa uluhiyah adalah hakimiyah yang paling tinggi
8070529 laa ilaha illallah sebagaimana yang dipahami oleh orang arab yang mengerti apa apa yang ditunjukkan oleh bahasanya yaitu tidak ada hakimiyah kecuali untuk allah dan tidak ada syariat kecuali dari allah serta tidak ada kekuasaan seseorang atas seseorang karena kekuasaan seluruhnya milik allah
8070530 sesungguhnya apa yang dinisbahkan oleh sayid kepada bahasa arab yaitu tentang makna uluhiyah adalah hakimiyah tidak dikenal oleh orang arab dan tidak pula dikenal oleh pakar pakar bahasa arab ataupun selain mereka bahkan al ilah menurut orang orang arab adalah yang diibadahi yang para hamba mendekatkan diri kepadanya dengan ibadah disertai ketundukan penghinaan diri kecintaan dan ketakutan bukan bermakna sesuatu yang mereka berhukum kepadanya
8070531 makna al ilah adalah dzat yang berhak untuk menjadi rabb yaitu yang menghakimi yang memiliki yang berbuat yang membuat syariat dan yang mengarahkan
8070532 perkara uluhiyah sedikit sekali menjadi bahan pertikaian pada kebanyakan orang orang jahiliyah khususnya jahiliyah arab hanya saja yang selalu menjadi bahan pertikaian adalah masalah rububiyah yaitu masalah penerapan dien pada kehidupan dunia ini berupa amal nyata yang mempengaruhi kehidupan manusia
8070533 termasuk dalam lingkup masyarakat jahiliyah adalah masyarakat yang mengaku dirinya muslim masyarakat tersebut masuk ke dalam lingkungan ini bukan karena meyakini uluhiyah kepada selain allah dan tidak pula karena menghadapkan syiar syiar ibadah kepada selain allah tetapi mereka masuk ke dalam masyarakat jahiliyah ini karena tidak beragama dengan peribadatan kepada allah dalam undang undang kehidupan mereka maka yang demikian walaupun mereka tidak meyakini uluhiyah seorang pun kecuali allah tetapi mereka telah memberikan yang paling istimewa dari keistimewaan keistimewaan ketuhanan kepada selain allah dan beragama dengan hakimiyah kepada selain allah
8070534 dan di sana ada syirik yang tampak jelas yaitu tunduk kepada selain allah dalam salah satu urusan kehidupan dan tunduk kepada aturan syariat yang dijadikan oleh manusia sebagai hukum hal ini merupakan asas dalam kesyirikan yang tidak bisa dibantah demikian pula tunduk kepada adat adat kebiasaan seperti mengadakan perayaan perayaan musim musim yang diatur oleh manusia padahal tidak disyariatkan oleh allah tunduk kepada aturan pakaian yang menyelisihi apa yang diperintahkan oleh allah untuk ditutupi dan membuka aurat aurat yang syariat allah telah menetapkan untuk ditutup 1 urusan seperti ini lebih dari sekedar pelanggaran dan dosa penyelisihan syariat karena urusan itu merupakan ketaatan dan ketundukan kepada pemahaman yang umum pada masyarakat berupa ciptaan hamba dan meninggalkan perkara jelas yang muncul dari penguasa para hamba sesungguhnya ketika itu bukan lagi dia sebagai dosa melainkan pensyariatan karena yang demikian merupakan ketundukan kepada selain allah dalam perkara yang menyelisihi perintah allah
8070535 sesungguhnya kesyirikian mereka jahiliyah yang asasi bukan dalam keyakinan tetapi pada masalah hakimiyah
8070536 kami mengajak untuk mengembalikan kehidupan yang islami dalam masyarakat yang islami dengan hukum aqidah islam dan pandangan yang islami sebagaimana dihukumi pula oleh syariat islam dan aturan yang islami kita telah mengetahui bahwa kehidupan islam seperti ini telah berhenti sejak lama di seluruh permukaan bumi dan keberadaan islam pun telah berhenti
8070537 kami menampakkan kenyataan yang terakhir ini walaupun akan menyebabkan munculnya benturan keras dan keputus asaan dari orang orang yang masih tetap menginginkan untuk menjadi muslimin
8070538 ketika kita memperhatikan seluruh permukaan bumi hari ini di bawah cahaya ketetapan ilahi terhadap pemahaman dien ini kita tidak mendapatkan keberadaan dien ini
8070539 telah bergeser jaman kembali seperti keadaan pada hari datangnya dien ini kepada manusia yaitu masa jahiliyah pent telah murtad manusia menuju peribadatan kepada hamba hamba dan menuju kerusakan agama agama mereka telah berpaling dari la ilaha illallah walaupun sekelompok dari mereka masih tetap mengumandangkan di menara menara adzan la ilaha illallah tanpa memahami maksudnya tanpa mengerti apa konsekwensinya padahal dia mengulang ulangnya juga tanpa menolak pensyariatan hakimiyah yang diaku oleh para hamba untuk diri diri mereka hal ini sama dengan penuhanan uluhiyah sama saja apakah diaku oleh pribadi pribadi atau team pensyariatan ataupun oleh masyarakat
8070540 yaitu kemanusiaan seluruhnya termasuk di dalamnya mereka yang mengulang ulang di menara menara adzan di timur atau di barat bumi ini kalimat laa ilaha illallah tanpa maksud dan tanpa kenyataan mereka paling berat dosanya dan paling keras adzabnya karena mereka telah murtad kepada peribadatan para hamba setelah jelas baginya petunjuk dan karena mereka sebelumnya berada dalam dien allah
8070541 inilah pengalaman yang allah tunjukkan kepada kelompok mukmin agar menjadi teladan
8070542 sesungguhnya tidak ada keselamatan bagi kelompok muslim di seluruh dunia dari adzab yang allah sebutkan atau dia mencampurkan kamu dalam golongan golongan yang saling bertentangan dan merasakan sebagian kamu keganasan sebagian yang lain 65 memisahkan keyakinan perasaan dan juga prinsip hidup mereka dari masyarakat jahiliyah dan memisahkan diri dari kaumnya hingga allah mengijinkan bagi mereka untuk mendirikan negara islam yang mereka berpegang padanya kalau tidak maka hendaknya mereka merasakan dengan seluruh perasaannya bahwa mereka sendirilah umat islam dan merasakan bahwa apa dan siapa yang di sekelilingnya yang tidak masuk kepada apa yang mereka masuki adalah jahiliyah dan masyarakat jahiliyah
8070543 dalam fase ini muncul buku buku as syahid sayid quthb yang merupakan fase terakhir dari pemikirannya yang mengkafirkan masyarakat dan menunda dakwah sampai kepada keteraturan islam dengan pembaharuan fikih dan perkembangannya menghidupkan ijtihad serta mengajak untuk memisahkan diri secara perasaan dari masyarakat memutus hubungan dengan orang lain mengumumkan jihad fisik melawan seluruh manusia
8070544 kita mengetahui dari apa yang telah lewat bahwa munculnya pemikiran takfir pengkafiran di kalangan beberapa ikhwan bermula dari penjara qanathir di akhir tahun lima puluhan dan awal enam puluhan mereka terpengaruh oleh sayid quthb dan pemikiran pemikirannya mereka mengambil pemahaman darinya bahwa masyarakat ini dalam keadaan jahiliyah dan bahwasanya dia telah mengkafirkan pemerintah yang merasa asing dengan hakimiyah allah karena tidak berhukum dengan apa yang diturunkan allah juga mengkafirkan rakyatnya karena mereka ridla dengan hal itu
8070545 dalam kejadian ini terpecah satu kelompok dari kelompok islam yang besar ketika keberadaan mereka di penjara penjara bersamaan dengan itu kelompok tersebut bertameng dengan pengkafiran kelompok islam yang besar mereka masih tetap dalam pendapatnya tentang pengkafiran pemerintah penolong penolongnya serta masyarakat seluruhnya kemudian kelompok tersebut berpecah kembali menjadi beberapa kelompok yang masing masing mengkafirkan yang lain
8070546 dan buku buku beliau tersebut memiliki keutamaan keutamaan dan pengaruh pengaruh positif yang besar di samping pengaruh pengaruh negatif
8070547 kami condong kepada anggapan bahwa khilafah ali radliallahu anhu adalah kelanjutan dari khilafah dua syaikh sebelumnya abu bakar dan umar pent adapun masa utsman merupakan celah antara keduanya
8070548 sesungguhnya di antara kejelekan yang muncul adalah bahwa utsman mencapai khilafah dalam keadaan tua telah lemah semangat islamnya dan lemah keinginannya untuk tetap tegar menghadapi tipu daya marwan dan tipu daya bani umayah di dalamnya
8070549 dan bahwasanya para shahabat mengetahui penyelewengan dari ruh islam ini maka mereka saling memanggil untuk menyelamatkan islam dan menyelamatkan khalifah dari bencana ini khalifah dengan ketuaan dan kepikunannya tidak dapat memegang urusannya dari marwan sesungguhnya sangat susah meragukan ruh islam di dalam hati utsman tetapi juga sangat sulit memaafkan kesalahan kesalahannya yang merupakan kesalahan fatal mengenai wilayah dan khilafahnya sedangkan dia seorang tua renta yang dikelilingi oleh jajaran orang orang jelek dari bani umayah
8070550 barangsiapa memandang dengan kacamata saya dan merasakan dengan ruh saya
8070551 i wont try to convince you that ive never plotted any more than id try to convince you that ive never told a lie but i do both as infrequently as possible
8070552 i distrust plot for two reasons first because our lives are largely plotless even when you add in all our reasonable precautions and careful planning and second because i believe plotting and the spontaneity of real creation arent compatible
8070553 m y basic belief about the making of stories is that they largely make themselves the job of the writer is to give them a place to grow
8070554 dan janganlah kalian menyerupai orang orang yang berpecah dan berselisih setelah datang keterangan kepada mereka dan bagi mereka adzab yang besar
8070555 allah tabaaraka wa taala melarang umat ini untuk menyerupai umat terdahulu dalam perpecahan dan perselisihan
8070556 berpeganglah kalian seluruhnya dengan tali allah dan jangan berpecah belah
8070557 telah diperintahkan kepada mereka kaum muslimin untuk bersatu dan melarang mereka dari perpecahan
8070558 yang dimaksud oleh allah azza wa jalla dari ayat tersebut adalah berpeganglah kalian dengan agama allah azza wa jalla yang telah dia perintahkan kepada kalian dan dengan janji nya yang telah diambil atas kalian di dalam kitab nya yaitu berkumpul di atas kalimat yang benar dan berserah kepada kalimat allah k
8070559 sesungguhnya orang orang yang memecah belah agamanya dan mereka terpecah menjadi beberapa golongan tidak ada sedikitpun tanggung jawabmu terhadap mereka
8070560 dia telah mensyariatkan bagi kamu tentang agama dan apa yang telah di wasiatkan nya kepada nuh dan apa yang telah kami wahyukan kepadamu dan apa yang telah kami wasiatkan kepada ibrahim musa dan isa yaitu tegakkanlah agama dan janganlah kamu berpecah belah tentangnya
8070561 allah telah mewasiatkan kepada seluruh nabi alaihish shalatu was salam untuk bersatu dan berjamaah serta melarang mereka dari perpecahan dan ikhtilaf
8070562 janganlah kalian berpecah belah dalam perkara tauhid dalam keimanan kepada allah ketaatan kepada rasul nya dan dalam menerima risalahnya
8070563 janganlah kalian menjadi golongan orang orang musyrik yaitu dari orang orang yang memecah belah agamanya menjadi berpartai partai dan masing masing partai mearasa bangga dengan yang ada pada mereka
8070564 di sini ada peringatan bagi kaum muslimin dari perselisihan perpecahan sehingga berkubu kubu setiap golongan fanatik dengan apa yang dimiliki baik yang haq dan batil sehingga dengannya mereka menyerupai orang orang musyrik dalam berpecah belah ingat agama adalah satu rasul yang satu dan sesembahan yang satu
8070565 termasuk seruan jahiliyah adalah menyeru untuk fanatik kepada kesukuan atau fanatisme kepada tokoh tertentu termasuk juga fanatisme dengan madzhab partai partai masyayikh atau mendahulukan hawa nafsu dan kesukuan dalam pembelaan terhadap segolongan orang bahkan menisbatkan diri kepadanya serta menyeru kepadanya nafsu dan kesukuan demikian pula saat dia memberikan loyalitas atau permusuhan dan mengukur manusia dengannya ini semua merupakan seruan jahiliyah
8070566 jikalau rabbmu menghendaki tentu dia menjadikan umat yang satu tetapi mereka senantiasa berselisih pendapat kecuali orang orang yang dirahmati rabbmu
8070567 allah mengabarkan jikalau dia menghendaki niscaya seluruh manusia akan dijadikan satu dalam keutuhan agama islam karena kehendak nya tidak terbatasi dan tidak ada sesuatu apapun yang bisa menghalangi nya tetapi tetap dengan hikmah nya mereka manusia berselisih menyelisihi jalan yang lurus dan mengikuti jalan jalan yang menjerumuskan ke an naar neraka masing masing dari mereka menyatakan kami berkata yang benar dan yang lainnya salah dan allah membimbing untuk sebagian umat kepada ilmu tentang al haq kemampuan beramal dengannya dan persatuan sehingga mereka merasakan kedamaian sejak dini yang kemudian teriringi dengan pertolongan dan taufiq dari allah azza wa jalla adapun yang lainnya adalah umat yang terhinakan dan berjalan dengan diri mereka sendiri
8070568 orang orang yang dirahmati adalah para pengikut para rasul yang selalu berpegang teguh dengan apa yang diperintahkan agama dan diperintahkan para rasul
8070569 orang orang yang dirahmati allah adalah ahlul jamaah walaupun negeri dan keberadaan mereka berjauhan sedangkan pelaku kemaksiatan kepada allah adalah ahlul furqah walaupun negeri dan keberadaan mereka bersatu
8070570 ketahuilah sesungguhnya orang orang sebelum kalian telah terpecah belah menjadi 72 firqah dan sungguh akan terpecah umat ini menjadi 73 firqah
8070571 sesungguhnya allah meridhai bagi kalian tiga perkara dan membenci bagi kalian tiga perkara meridhai bagi kalian untuk hanya beribadah kepada nya jangan kalian sekutukan dia dengan sesuatu apapun dan kalian semua berpegang teguh kepada tali allah dan jangan kalian berpecah belah
8070572 berpegang teguh dengan tali allah adalah berpegang dengan apa yang telah dibawa rasulullah al qur an as sunnah dan yang mencakup semua bimbingan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam berupa perkara akidah ibadah akhlak muamalah tidak boleh bagi seorang muslim baik secara pribadi ataupun golongan masyarakat muslimin atau suatu negeri muslim dari rakyat dan pemerintah untuk keluar dari perkara ushuluddin atau furunya akan tetapi wajib bagi umat untuk beriman dan berpegang teguh secara menyeluruh dengan apa yang telah dibawa oleh penutup para nabi dan pemimpin para rasul serta selalu mendahulukan bimbingan ajaran nabi dari semua ucapan dan bimbingan yang lainnya
8070573 dan patuhlah kalian semua kepada allah dan rasul nya dan janganlah kalian berselisih sehingga kalian akan melemah dan pudar kekuatan kalian dan bersabarlah sesungguhnya allah bersama dengan orang orang yang sabar
8070574 agama islam adalah satu yaitu apa yang telah dibawa oleh rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam tidak bisa dipecah menjadi beberapa sekte atau madzhab bahkan agama kebenaran adalah satu dan datang dari allah yang telah dibawa oleh rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam dan apa yang beliau tinggalkan kepada umatnya yaitu beliau tinggalkan umatnya di atas kemurnian kejelasan malamnya seperti siangnya tidak ada yang menyeleweng darinya kecuali akan binasa
8070575 allah telah memerintahkan kepada kalian untuk menjadi orang yang mengikuti taat mendengar dan patuh seandainya umat dibebaskan dengan akalnya qias dan hawa nafsunya dalam memahami tauhid dan mencari keimanan sungguh mereka akan sesat
8070576 sungguh jelas bahwa sebab persatuan dan keutuhan adalah mengumpulkan menerima semua bagian agama dan mengamalkanya secara keseluruhan hal itu merupakan bentuk ibadah kepada allah yang esa tidak ada sekutu baginya yang diwujudkan secara lahir dan batin sebagaimana yang telah diperintahkan dan faedah dari berjamaah adalah tercurahkannya rahmat allah keridhaan nya keselamatan kebahagiaan dunia dan akhirat muka yang putih cemerlang adapun buah dari perpecahan adalah adzab allah laknat muka yang hitam dan berlepasdirinya rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam darinya
8070577 berpegang teguh dengan kitabullah sesuai dengan apa yang allah inginkan bisa terealisasikan dalam tiga perkara
8070578 sungguh telah kami turunkan ad dzikr dan sungguh kami akan menjaganya
8070579 al qur an adalah imam rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam dan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam adalah pemimpin bagi para shahabatnya dan shahabat shahabat beliau adalah pemimpin bagi umat yang setelahnya
8070580 sungguh rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam dan para shahabatnya telah memberikan bimbingan barangsiapa yang mengambilnya maka hal itu adalah suatu sikap membenarkan kitabullah penyempurnaan ketaatan dan sebuah ketegaran dalam beragama barang siapa mengambil petunjuk dengannya sungguh dia akan terbimbing dan barangsiapa menolongnya maka dia akan ditolong siapa yang menyelisihinya serta mengikuti selain dari jalan orang orang yang beriman para shahabat maka allah akan palingkan dia sebagaimana dia telah berpaling dan akan masukkan dia ke jahannam sebagai tempat kembali yang paling jelek
8070581 dan barangsiapa yang menentang ar rasul setelah jelas baginya petunjuk dan mengikuti selain jalan orang orang mukminin niscaya dia kami palingkan sebagaimana dia telah berpaling dan akan kami masukkan dia ke neraka jahannam sebagai sejelek jelek tempat kembali
8070582 bimbingan as sunnah harus diterima dengan tidak membenturkannya dengan pikiran akal atau melawannya dengan qiyas kita harus menafsirkan dengan apa yang telah ditafsirkan para salafush shalih beramal dengan apa yang telah mereka amalkan meninggalkan apa yang telah ditinggalkannya dan menahan diri dari apa yang mereka diam mengikuti mereka pada apa yang telah mereka terangkan menjadikan mereka sebagai qudwah dalam pemahaman dari apa yang telah mereka alami dan kita tidak keluar dari jamaah mereka dalam perselisihan atau penafsiran
8070583 sesungguhnya as sunnah adalah penjelas al quran dan as sunnah tidak dapat diraih sekedar dengan qiyas dan akal akan tetapi diraih dengan ittiba meneladani kepada para imam dan apa yang sebagian besar dari umat ini telah berjalan di atasnya
8070584 berilah kabar gembira para hamba ku yang mendengarkan suatu ucapan kemudian mengikuti apa yang terbaik mereka adalah orang orang yang telah diberi petunjuk allah dan mereka adalah orang orang yang memiliki akal
8070585 ini merupakan jalan ku yang lurus maka ikutlah dan janganlah kalian mengikuti berbagai jalan niscaya kalian akan berpecah dari jalan nya hal itu merupakan wasiat bagi kalian semoga kalian bertaqwa
8070586 barangsiapa menyelisihi para shahabat rasulullah dalam suatu perkara agama maka sungguh dia akan sesat
8070587 asas ditegakkannya jamaah adalah para shahabat nabi muhammad semoga allah merahmati mereka semua dan mereka adalah ahlus sunnah wal jamaah maka barangsiapa yang tidak mengambil dari mereka maka sungguh telah sesat dan berbuat bidah dan setiap bidah adalah sesat dan setiap kesesatan dan pelakunya tempatnya adalah neraka
8070588 sesungguhnya ahlus sunnah merasakan kedamaian yang sejuk di hati mereka hal ini disebabkan jelas dan kokohnya kebenaran di dalam hati mereka karena sesungguhnya lafadz as sunnah memberikan makna keharusan beramal dengan apa yang telah dibawa rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam yaitu al qur an dan as sunnah adapun lafadz al jamaah maknanya adalah bersatu di atas al haq mengamalkannya dan berjalan di atas jejak salaf
8070589 merupakan suatu kewajiban untuk kita berpegang teguh dengan ahlus sunnah wal jamaah berpegang dengan ucapan ucapan mereka tidak keluar dari landasan landasan ketentuan ketentuan dan dari apa apa yang telah ditetapkan dari para ulama karena mereka mengetahui landasan landasan ahlus sunnah wal jamaah dalil dalil syariah yang tidak diketahui kebanyakan dari umat manusia bahkan juga mereka yang menisbatkan dirinya sebagai ulama hal ini dikarenakan mantapnya ilmu mereka sisi pandang yang tepat dan kokoh di atas ilmu
8070590 hendaknya kalian pegangi sunnahku dan sunnah al khulafa ar rasyidin gigitlah dia dengan gigi gerahammu dan hati hati kalian dari perkara yang diada adakan sungguh setiap bidah adalah sesat
8070591 yang dimaksud dengan al khulafa ar rasyidin adalah mereka yang mewarisi ilmu yang bermanfaat dan amalan yang baik dan umat yang paling berhak dengan sifat ini adalah para shahabat yang allah meridhai mereka sungguh allah telah memilih mereka untuk menyertai nabi nya dalam menegakkan agama dan tidaklah allah yang maha mengetahui dan maha bijaksana memilih untuk menyertai nabi nya kecuali umat yang paling sempurna keimanannya paling benar akalnya paling lurus amalannya paling kuat tekadnya paling lurus jalan mereka sungguh mereka adalah umat yang paling berhak untuk diikuti setelah nabi dan juga para imam yang mengetahui petunjuk dan kebaikan
8070592 ketahuilah semoga allah merahmatimu sesungguhnya tidak sempurna islam seseorang sehingga dia menjadi orang yang muttabi meneladani membenarkan menyerahkan yakin maka barangsiapa menganggap bahwa masih ada urusan agama yang tidak disampaikan para shahabat rasulullah kepada kita sungguh dia telah menuduh mereka dengan kedustaan dan cukup apa yang dia lakukan sebagai suatu sikap memisahkan diri dan menikam mereka maka dia telah berbuat bidah sesat menyesatkan membikin suatu perkara yang baru dalam agama yang bukan darinya
8070593 wajib bagi kalian berjamaah dan hati hati dari perpecahan sesungguhnya setan bersama orang yang menyendiri dan dia akan lebih jauh apabila kalian berdua
8070594 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam memerintahkan kita untuk bersatu di atas al kitab dan as sunnah serta melarang kita dari perpecahan dan perselisihan
8070595 terus akan ada segolongan dari umatku yang selalu menang di atas kebenaran tidak bermudharat bagi mereka orang orang yang ingin menghinakannya hingga datang ketentuan dari allah maka mereka tetap seperti itu
8070596 al jamaah adalah yang mencocoki al haq walaupun engkau sendiri
8070597 berpeganglah kalian semua kepada tali allah dan janganlah kalian bercerai berai
8070598 ketahuilah sesungguhnya aku meninggalkan dua perkara yang berat pada kalian salah satunya kitabullah azza wa jalla dan dia adalah tali allah barangsiapa mengikutinya dia berada di atas hidayah dan barangsiapa yang meninggalkannya ia di atas kesesatan
8070599 barangsiapa ingin mengambil uswah maka hendaknya mengambil uswah dari para shahabat rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam mereka adalah umat yang paling bersih hatinya paling dalam ilmunya tidak suka membebani diri mendapatkan petunjuk yang paling lurus dan memiliki kondisi yang paling mulia suatu kaum yang telah allah pilih untuk menyertai nabi nya dan menegakkan agamanya ketahuilah kemuliaan mereka dan ikuti jalan jalan mereka sungguh mereka berada di atas petunjuk yang lurus
8070600 sesungguhnya yang takut kepada allah dari hamba hamba nya adalah para ulama
8070601 katakanlah apakah sama antara mereka yang berilmu dan mereka yang tidak berilmu
8070602 hendaknya kalian berpegang teguh dengan atsar atsar dan para ulamanya bertanyalah kepada mereka dan duduklah bersama mereka serta raih ilmu dari mereka
8070603 takutlah kepada allah takutlah kepada allah dalam dirimu hendaknya kamu berpegang dengan atsar dan dan para ulamanya hendaknya kalian mengikuti sesungguhnya agama itu dengan mengikuti ittiba
8070604 para ulama adalah lentera yang dengannya umat akan mencari secercah cahaya
8070605 barangsiapa menginginkan bagian tengah dari jannah maka hendaknya ia berpegang dengan jamaah
8070606 barangsiapa taat kepadaku sungguh dia telah taat kepada allah dan barangsiapa bermaksiat kepadaku sungguh dia telah bermaksiat kepada allah dan barangsiapa patuh kepada amir sungguh dia telah patuh kepadaku dan barangsiapa bermaksiat kepada amir maka sungguh dia telah bermaksiat kepadaku
8070607 penguasa adalah naungan allah di bumi barangsiapa memuliakannya maka sungguh dia telah memuliakan allah dan barang siapa menghinakannya maka sungguh allah akan menghinakannya
8070608 mendengar dan patuh merupakan kewajiban baik dalam perkara yang disukai atau dibenci selama tidak diperintahkan dalam kemaksiatan dan apabila diperintahkan dengan kemaksiatan maka tidak didengarkan dan jangan dipatuhi
8070609 maka pernahkah kamu melihat orang yang menjadikan hawa nafsunya menjadi sesembahan dan allah membiarkannya sesat berdasarkan ilmunya dan allah telah mengunci mati pendengaran dan hatinya dan meletakkan tutup di atas penglihatannya maka siapakah yang akan memberikannya petunjuk sesudah allah tidakkah kalian mengingat
8070610 makna ayat ini adalah menyembah apa yang diinginkan hawa nafsunya atau yang dianggap baik apabila dia sudah menganggap baik hawa nafsunya ed maka sungguh dia telah mengambil sebagai sesembahan
8070611 dan siapakah yang lebih sesat daripada yang mengikuti hawa nafsunya tanpa petunjuk dari allah
8070612 dan janganlah kalian mengikuti hawa nafsu karena ia akan menyesatkanmu dari jalan allah
8070613 ya allah jauhkan kami dari kemungkaran akhlak hawa nafsu dan penyakit
8070614 aku tidak tahu mana anugrah yang lebih besar bagiku apakah saat aku dibimbing allah dari kesyirikan menuju islam ataukah ketika allah menjaga keislamanku dari berbagai hawa nafsu
8070615 semua hawa nafsu adalah jelek dan akan menyeru kepada pemberontakan
8070616 sesungguhnya dia setan menyuruh kalian berbuat jelek dan keji dan kalian berkata atas nama allah dengan tanpa ilmu
8070617 ilmu adalah apa yang telah datang dari shahabat shahabat nabi muhammad shallallahu alaihi wasallam dan sesuatu yang tidak datang dari mereka bukan dinamakan ilmu
8070618 sesungguhnya aku adalah manusia apabila aku perintahkan kalian dengan sesuatu perkara agama maka ambillah dan apabila aku perintahkan kalian dengan sesuatu yang itu adalah hasil pikiranku maka ketahuilah bahwa aku adalah manusia
8070619 hati hati kalian dari ashhabur ra yi pengagum akal sesungguhnya mereka adalah musuh musuh as sunnah mereka tidak mampu lemah untuk menghafal hadits hadits sehingga mereka berkata dengan akal sesatlah mereka dan menyesatkan
8070620 telah pergi hilang para pembaca dan ulama kalian sehingga manusia mengambil para pemimpin bodoh yang hanya mengiyakan suatu perkara dengan akal
8070621 tinggalkan oleh kalian pendapat pendapat dan ucapan ucapan orang sungguh ucapan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam lebih suci dan lebih jelas
8070622 semua perkara yang telah allah tegakkan sebagai hujjah di dalam al kitab al quran atau yang melalui lisan nabi nya merupakan suatu nash yang jelas tidak boleh bagi orang yang telah berilmu untuk menyelisihinya
8070623 tidak boleh bagi seseorang yang tidak berilmu tentang al quran as sunnah dan apa yang telah dilakukan oleh generasi yang dahulu dari ulil amr ulama salaf untuk berijtihad dengan akalnya sehingga mengakibatkan ijtihadnya menyelisihi al quran dan as sunnah serta apa yang telah di sepakati
8070624 ketahuilah semoga allah merahmatimu sungguh siapa yang berkata dalam agama allah dengan akal qiyas dan takwil tanpa menyertakan hujjah dari as sunnah dan al jamaah bimbingan shahabat maka sungguh dia telah berkata atas nama allah tanpa ilmu dan barangsiapa yang berkata atas nama allah tanpa ilmu maka sungguh dia termasuk orang yang membebani diri
8070625 maka hendaklah orang orang yang menyelisihi perintah nya takut akan ditimpa cobaan atau ditimpa adzab yang pedih
8070626 semoga allah menyelamatkan kami dan kalian semuanya dari pemikiran pemikiran yang muncul dari hawa nafsu yang selalu mengekor dan madzhab mazdhab yang bidah sungguh pelakunya telah keluar dari persatuan menuju percerai beraian dari suatu kestabilan menuju perpecahan dari kedamaian menuju ketakutan dari kesepakatan menuju perselisihan dari cinta menjadi kebencian dari keikhlasan nasehat dan loyalitas menjadi kecurangan dan permusuhan dan semoga kami dan kita semua dilindungi dari berloyalitas terhadap segala bentuk nama gerakan yang menyelisihi islam dan as sunnah
8070627 adapun orang orang yang dalam hatinya condong kepada kesesatan maka mereka mengikuti sebagian ayat ayat yang mutasyabihat untuk menimbulkan fitnah dan untuk mencari cari tawilnya
8070628 adapun orang orang yang di hatinya ada penyakit penyimpangan penyelewengan yang dikarenakan jeleknya tujuan maka mereka mengikuti suatu yang mutasyabih darinya al qur an kemudian menjadikannya dalil atas ucapan mereka yang batil dan pemikirannya yang hina dalam rangka mencari fitnah dan menyelewengkan pemahaman terhadap kitab nya serta mentakwilkannya sesuai dengan aliran dan madzhab mereka yang batil sehingga mereka sesat dan menyesatkan adapun para ulama yang kokoh ilmunya terhadap al qur an yang ilmu dan keyakinan menancap di dada mereka sehingga melahirkan baginya suatu amalan dan berbagai pengetahuan mereka mengetahui bahwa al qur an semuanya datang dari allah semuanya haq baik yang muhkam atau yang mutasyabih dan suatu yang haq tidak akan bertentangan ketika mereka mengetahui dan memahami makna al muhkam dengan sebenar benarnya sehingga mereka mampu mengembalikan suatu yang samar kepadanya al muhkam yang sebelumnya merupakan suatu yang rumit dikarenakan kurangnya ilmu dan kurangnya pengetahuan saat mereka mengembalikan suatu yang mutasyabih kepada al muhkam maka semuanya menjadi al muhkam
8070629 yang menjelaskan perkara ini adalah apa yang telah diriwayatkan ibnu wahb dari bukair sesungguhnya dia telah bertanya kepada nafi bagaimana pendapat ibnu umar tentang haruriyah khawarij
8070630 barangsiapa yang tidak berhukum dengan apa apa yang telah diturunkan allah maka mereka adalah orang orang kafir
8070631 katakanlah inilah jalan agamaku aku dan orang yang mengikutiku mengajak kamu kepada allah dengan bashirah ilmu maha suci allah dan aku tiada termasuk orang orang yang musyrik
8070632 yaitu orang orang yang memecah belah agama mereka dan mereka menjadi beberapa golongan tiap tiap golongan merasa bangga dengan apa yang di golongan mereka
8070633 setiap golongan akan berkelompok dan untuk membela apa yang dimiliki dari kebatilan menggilas dan memerangi yang lain
8070634 seruan fanatisme terhadap tokoh tertentu merupakan perkara yang tertolak menurut syariat allah walaupun diiringi dengan kalimat kalimat yang mempersatukan berbagai firqah tanpa melihat akidah dan manhaj bahkan tanpa mempedulikan bimbingan para ulama salaf
8070635 sungguh keberadaannya membawa perpecahan di antara kaum muslimin hizbiyah permusuhan pertentangan fanatisme golongan serta mengikat tali loyalitas dengan fanatik pada golongan tak peduli siapapun mereka baik seorang asyari rafidhah sufi pengkultus kuburan dan melepaskan ikatan tali loyalitas terhadap mereka yang tidak bergabung dengan partainya walupun mereka adalah ulama sunni
8070636 muncul di zaman ini jamaah jamaah dan berbagai golongan yang menisbatkan dirinya kepada as sunnah dan dakwah di jalan allah seperti ikhwanul muslimin dan berbagai sempalannya seperti jamaah takfir wal hijrah atau para pengikut sayyid quthub yang dipelopori dalam mengibarkan panjinya oleh muhammad surur zainal abidin yang meninggalkan negeri islam dan
8070637 sebagian umat tidak memperdulikan akidah dan manhaj rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam bahkan mereka menempuh prinsip dan akidah lain yang hakikatnya adalah produk setan bagi orang yang allah hinakan dari seorang mubtadi dan penyesat
8070638 berikan kepadaku satu kitab aku tuliskan untuk kalian suatu kitab niscaya kalian tidak akan berselisih
8070639 pergilah kalian dariku sungguh tidak pantas berselisih di sisi nabi

8070714 we at the ministry of the hunt regret to announce that due to the lack of audience each night we must cut back on expenses as such we will be eliminating certain positions

8070716 about 54 of uk businesses start without any business planning at all so theyre often described as accidental entrepreneurs
8070717 something forces a change in their life normally it would appear to be in their 30s prompting them from doing what theyre doing to being an entrepreneur
8070718 we found the spark that makes that happen doesnt necessarily leap from im going to do this to im going to make a plan
8070719 and anyone who brought up a kid knows that free will is as real as gravity
8070720 entrepreneurship is the relentless pursuit of opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled
8070721 do you ever get tired of being a handler tosca
8070722 as much as you are tired of the hunt we each have to do what we must to survive
8070723 i dont know anything precise all i know you will need the key and

8070733 lets sit in the garden behind the hotel its pretty back there
8070734 i hope my notes are coherent i still cant make sense of what happened yesterday its still not clear to me whether i was dreaming in the caf or really saw the girl
8070735 lets go across to the park itll be quiet there and cool under the trees we can go to the caf later for a coffee
8070736 you know all about it you arrange all my hunts
8070737 yes i do we are almost to the end of our relationship
8070738 we dont have a relationship you have my daughter i am trying to get her back that does not create a relationship
8070739 i have a lot of money riding on you this hunt
8070740 no now let me speak to her or i dont run
8070741 you are not in a position to barter if you dont run your daughter dies
8070742 she may as well be dead already since i never see her if i dont run you lose your money
8070743 you have a point i do not want to lose my money nor do i want to kill your daughter she is too valuable to me to you to dyad for that matter i will concede but with a condition
8070744 there is always a condition with you what do you want this time
8070745 i want a larger spread on the points you have won each hunt but there has not been any odds on the outcome i want you to win with a thirty tick advantage over the hunter
8070746 thirty ticks i am out there running for my life and the life of my daughter how do i know the hunter is not going to want to kill me six lionesses were killed instead of mated last cycle i have to run as though it is my life i am not willing to slow down not only do i not want to mate with a hunter but i want my daughter back but how in leanas name do i run a hunt and win with a thirty tick advantage
8070747 the how is not my concern if you want to talk to your daughter you have to agree to win with a thirty tick lead if you only want to win then you do not need to talk to your daughter it is simple
8070748 very well you will have your thirty ticks the hunter doesnt have to survive does he
8070749 not at all losing a hunter might even create more audience but that is your call here is your daughter
8070750 i am here bescjen i wanted to hear your voice before i ran again
8070751 i am well mama i do as i am told and i behave myself the mister allowed me to have some sweets last night he said that you ran very well and made him a lot of money mama if i refuse sweets will you come home and stop running the hunts
8070752 bescjen the choice for me to stop running the hunt is up to the mister although if i win this hunt there will only be two more to run
8070753 you had better get ready for the hunt bes has school work she must complete
8070754 thirty ticks and only two more hunts then you free her

8070780 dan pada sisi allah lah kunci kunci semua yang ghaib tidak ada yang mengetahuinya kecuali dia sendiri dan dia mengetahui apa yang di daratan dan di lautan dan tiada sehelai daun pun yang gugur melainkan dia mengetahuinya pula dan tidak jatuh sebutir biji pun dalam kegelapan bumi dan tidak sesuatu yang basah atau yang kering melainkan tertulis dalam kitab yang nyata lauh mahfudz
8070781 dan apabila hamba hamba ku bertanya kepadamu tentang aku maka jawablah bahwasanya aku adalah dekat
8070782 al baqarah 2 186 kemudian orang orang itu berlaku sekehendak hatinya di muka bumi
8070783 akan tetapi dia berkata hendaklah kamu menjadi orang orang rabbani karena kamu selalu mengajarkan al kitab dan disebabkan kamu tetap mempelajarinya
8070784 katakanlah sesungguhnya aku telah ditunjuki oleh rabbku pada jalan yang lurus yaitu jalan agama yang benar agama ibrahim yang lurus dan ibrahim itu bukanlah termasuk orang orang yang musyrik
8070785 maka hadapkanlah wajahmu dengan lurus kepada agama allah tetaplah atas fitrah allah yang telah menciptakan manusia menurut fitrah itu
8070786 allah membuat perumpamaan yaitu seorang laki laki budak yang dimiliki oleh beberapa orang yang berserikat yang dalam perselisihan dan seorang budak yang menjadi milik penuh dari seorang laki laki saja
8070787 dan juga orang orang yang apabila mengerjakan perbuatan keji atau menganiaya diri sendiri mereka ingat akan allah lalu memohon ampun terhadap dosa dosa mereka dan siapa lagi yang dapat mengampuni dosa selain daripada allah
8070788 jika aku melakukan suatu maksiat maka aku akan melihat akibatnya dalam perilaku pembantu dan hewan tungganganku
8070789 tentu seorang al fudhail bin iyadh tidak bertutur mengada ada tetapi pastilah merupakan mutiara hikmah kehidupannya
8070790 dia begitu aku rupanya allah sedang menunjukkan kepadaku begini rasanya begini sedihnya
8070791 jika anda merasa jiwa anda kotor maka ingatlah bahwa ada nikmat yang mungkin tidak anda syukuri atau anda melakukan suatu kesalahan
8070792 jika ada yang tidak beres dengan hidup kita pasti ada yang tidak beres juga antara kita dan allah
8070793 satu hal yang menandakan bahwa engkau sangat tertipu ialah tatkala engkau berbuat jahat namun dia membalasmu dengan kebaikan namun engkau tak kunjung ingin bertaubat dengan mengira bahwa dosa dosamu bakal diampuni
8070794 jika hamba hambaku taat kepadaku maka akan aku turunkan hujan kepada mereka di malam hari aku pancarkan matahari tanpa awan di pagi hari dan tidak akan aku perdengarkan gelegar guntur
8070795 ataukah kita ini masih ragu atas janji allah bahwa ketika kita mendekatnya sejengkal maka allah akan mendekat kita sehasta jika kita mendekatnya sehasta allah akan mendekat sedepa kalau kita berjalan mendekatnya maka allah akan berlari
8070796 sesungguhnya bilangan bulan pada sisi allah adalah dua belas bulan dalam ketetapan allah di waktu dia menciptakan langit dan bumi di antaranya empat bulan haram itulah ketetapan agama yang lurus maka janganlah kamu menganiaya diri kamu dalam bulan yang empat itu dan perangilah kaum musyrikin itu semuanya sebagaimana merekapun memerangi kamu semuanya dan ketahuilah bahwasanya allah beserta orang orang yang bertakwa
8070797 saya tidak makan selain pada waktu malam semenjak berpisah denganmu
8070798 puasalah di bulan haram lalu tinggalkanlah puasalah di bulan haram lalu tinggalkanlah puasalah di bulan haram lalu tinggalkanlah

8070800 tidak dikenal oleh seorang pun dari kalangan kaum muslimin yang menjadikan malam isra sebagai malam istimewa berbeda dengan yang lain para sahabat dan tabiin tidak pernah mengkhususkan malam isra dengan amalan amalan tertentu tidak juga mengenangnya dengan acara acara tertentu oleh karena itu tidak ada malam termasuk malam isra yang dianggap sebagai malam yang paling utama bagi rasulullah saw tidak ada dalil yang diketahui tentang bulannya tentang 10 harinya apalagi tentang hari h bahkan nukilan tentang itu semua terputus riwayatnya dan saling berselisih tidak ada yang qathi tentang itu dan tidak ada syariat bagi kaum muslimin yang mengistimewakan malam itu dengan shalat atau lainnya

8070868 its kind of hard to believe that he garcia is in this position but knowing him as well as i do its not really surprising
8070869 hes tough and resilient and willing to work his ass off to get back im more proud of him than surprised
8070870 the offensive line is the heart and soul of any offense and we have a chance to have one of the better ones this school has had in a long time and thats important to us
8070871 wherever we go we dont fear anybody well be on the front lines and whoever is back there is back there we will do what we have to do
8070872 last year we were so close and this year we are tired of being so close
8070873 people saying we played well but lost nobody wants to hear that losing is losing no matter how you look at it as far as finishing game theres going to be a lot more of it this year
8070874 i think it just comes down to making sure you do the right things and realizing what you want in life
8070875 ive been here too long and had too many setbacks im tired of coasting and not doing what i want to do which is play football
8070876 the kids that are going to be playing know what they are doing and have worked real hard and deserve to play because theyve earned it
8070877 they should be primed and eager to play in that kind of environment
8070878 sometimes when things dont look like they are there he can make a big play and thats exciting
8070879 whenever you can give the ball to a guy that can score any time he touches it thats fun you like playing with guys like that hes worked hard and its going to be exciting to watch him
8070880 obviously it helps because his marcus name is out there so when they see my name they think i must be good too
8070881 im kind of laid back but i think i might get a little more excited than them at times
8070882 i might do a little more talking than them i might be a little more aggressive
8070883 they like how i make the big plays and how i can turn a game around for my team
8070884 they like my technique my footwork my hips and my jumping ability and those type of things
8070885 i wouldnt mind playing offense but i really want to be a corner
8070886 if it happens that i find a school in the middle of the season ill make a decision then
8070887 it plays a part but location isnt a problem to me
8070888 i want to make my own statement but im not saying i wouldnt go to that school or any school in washington i just want to try and find the best place for me
8070889 i need to really vibe with the position coach and see what type of guy he is
8070890 and i need to meet some of the players and see what they have to say about the school they are living it so they can tell me how it is thats it really
8070891 perhaps it was just a case of a professional photographer picking up on the events
8070892 damn i look cool im totally making a difference right now
8070893 calculo que meus dois grupos assassinaram 3 mil pessoas ou mais muitos deles eram atirados ao rio cauca
8070894 matamos muita gente s pelo fato de que eram apontadas
8070895 quando chegamos a urab decapitamos muita gente era uma estrat gia para promover o terror para que tivessem mais medo de n s do que da guerrilha
8070896 depois de um tempo o poder p blico come ou a pressionar e disseram que nos deixariam continuar trabalhando mas t nhamos que desaparecer com as pessoas assim come aram a surgir as fossas comuns
8070897 assassin vamos pessoas todos os dias em todos os munic pios de urab
8070898 os pol ticos se utilizaram das autodefesas para alcan ar seus objetivos
8070899 fazem qualquer coisa para chegar ao poder nos procuravam para que os apoi ssemos sabendo que ramos ilegais
8070900 uma guerra t o longa e t o atroz n o se conta em um m s ou dois meses h gente que diz que a verdade n o est sendo contada
8070901 will it block up our arteries belabor our hearts befoul our blood
8070902 then after that we believe based on the no shows and the second party that showed up we believe that our activities had been compromised so we ended the operation
8070903 to me it just shows that the old thinking of rural america is still prevalent there is evidence that with all the new equipment people still think like that out here help each other help each other out
8070904 discrimination because of course the former makes it sound like its something graciously granted
8070905 gives me a lot of strength inside knowing that people you dont even know would come over here and do this
8070906 it used to make me nervous but then i just realized im not going to go to jail and get the company fined lots of money just so you can drink
8070907 i make them take it out of their wallet so i can make sure it feels real
8070908 we do not know the extent of his dependence on bottled oxygen
8070909 its a school system where people want to come to school and they want to send their children to school at
8070910 the biggest thing is to get to know the kids and this actually allows them to do that it breaks a school our size down to a pretty small unit
8070911 what percentage of people in fargo remember when it didnt have a royal fork
8070912 we had a great run for a lot of years
8070913 was kind of an institution they had a very consistent product were going to miss them
8070914 if im guilty of arguing im guilty but i didnt hurt anyone i would never hit anyone
8070915 i think as a driver this could have been held a lot different what the hell am i going to do now
8070916 this just didnt take me out of racing it took my sponsors out of racing too
8070917 the issue with wsi was the rules were not specific enough about why this employee got a particular 25 certificate that month
8070918 now wsi is going to be required to document that were going to give 25 certificates if a workers performance is x amount above and beyond
8070919 lets not go overboard on jury questions lets stick to the meat of their opinion of the case what they know about the case
8070920 jurors dont like filling them out the more focused we can make them the more willing they are to fill them out and be honest with us beforehand
8070921 we have a chance to do the right thing to step up and with a big mind approach this issue
8070922 what is to be gained by keeping the name and conversely what do we lose for giving up a name that could be so important
8070923 i think as we move past this we can make this change gracefully
8070924 i was the son of a minister and i was learning to move into this culture that was very different from my life
8070925 it gave me a year to grow up and mature understand what college was all about
8070926 the fact that he went to und also makes it kind of cool
8070927 i didnt want to miss this because he doesnt get back here very often
8070928 it takes a lot of money to change a nickname
8070929 150 people lining the shores watching this guy jump off my dock
8070930 a total package as a player he had to learn how to include his teammates
8070931 small town hospitals are asking themselves for two or three or four deliveries a month is it worth having all these resources and all this equipment and all the liability
8070932 even though the city and business leaders have asked to reconsider and are willing to help investigate alternatives they will not change their stance
8070933 its very frustrating for me the board and the physicians but the stakes are too high
8070934 the only alternative is to keep the department and risk losing the whole thing
8070935 it could be a blizzard and we could be in a world of hurt
8070936 it fuel used to be 2 percent now its 6 percent of our budget
8070937 some days im a puddle and some days im as ornery as ever
8070938 everyone needs to know your business here but thats ok
8070939 you can walk wherever you need to go its a neat clean town right away it seemed an easygoing laid back place where everyone is nice
8070940 were walking through the rubble of the trailer when someone steps on billy bass
8070941 it started singing dont worry be happy we werent sure whether to laugh or cry
8070942 even people who dont like me and there are quite a few because im very outspoken are still nice to me and still wave
8070943 he was smirking while mr ruan was saying where they went
8070944 he said oh well im sure that was a complete waste of time

8070952 kids have great faith not like teenagers when i said uncle bob is in heaven looking down on us my kids accepted it isnt that great
8070953 but how will children accept death if theres nothing higher to believe in
8070954 for i am not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek for therein is revealed a righteousness of god from faith unto faith as it is written but the righteous shall live by faith
8070955 were onto a winner here seabass lets have more of the same please
8070956 oh for the second year in a row we have seen a version of pes that is great problem is no one else has
8070957 these brands also created value in other ways but they illustrate the point that business engineering is one of the keys to brand value creation and a key point is this the business processes they pioneered led to an enhanced customer experience in other words the new business process didnt just create greater efficiency or better margins it also improved the customers experience of the brand and so built the brand
8070958 there is probably no company that has understood market dominance better through history than the coca cola company they designed the first stand alone fridges because they understood that delivering the brand cold would be the key to creating impulse consumption
8070959 but by designing the stand alone fridges they also ensured that they were the only game in town when it came to on the spot impulse consumption from the start coca cola has understood the importance of dominating the physical aspects of the consumer landscape
8070960 before the campaign no one cared what was in their computer once the campaign had gained momentum however many people wouldnt buy a computer unless it had an intel inside

8070969 if you were really womyn you wouldnt demand to go where youre not wanted
8070970 you may be hurt and upset that certain womens events dont let us in but as
8070971 how like men to invent words to impose on other people
8070972 if you dont like it you should start your own shelters
8070973 you have a psychological need to have had a trans male abuser
8070974 autogynephilic transsexuals anger over baileys book is an example of narcissistic rage
8070975 i know when youre coming out it feels like they should be supporting you but they dont have a support group or a therapist they dont have
8070976 i know there werent any other trans women or genderqueers in the room but
8070977 and many trans women retain these masculine traits after transition often to their advantage
8070978 you were trained to be self confident and assertive as a child
8070979 the more i read on this list the more im convinced that transwomen are delusional
8070980 autogynephilic transsexuals say they were feminine as children but theyre lying
8070981 any male transsexual who says otherwise is either delusional or lying
8070982 what did i do for the intersex community i wrote this book didnt i
8070983 well its better to have something problematic than nothing at all
8070984 its just a dance party you cant control these kinds of things
8070985 i really appreciate them creating this space so i dont want them to get the bad rap
8070986 i totally respect you i have nothing against trans people trust me im a gay woman i know what youre going through
8070987 we shouldnt have to wait for our protections its not like youve been in this community except in the last five years or like you gave your lives to our cause anyway
8070988 the reason theres less violence against trans men is because we pass better
8070989 in many ways black trans women have the reverse experience they no longer get profiled by the police for driving while black become less vulnerable to violence and are more accepted as leaders after transition
8070990 mi intenci n es que la m sica y las letras de este disco sean sorprendentes y que como sucede con un buen mago no se vean los trucos
8070991 we wanted to hold this march to show our significance as a transgender gender non conforming community to ourselves to non trans queer people and to others but also to build connections within a sometimes fragmented set of trans communities
8070992 we had an incredible range of diversity at this march and were really proud of that but we hope to improve upon it next year
8070993 who threatens people for their own safety nobody was throwing rocks its just an excuse for their own transphobia
8070994 shame shame well be back we wont fold under attack
8070995 the difference between our treatment by the police and that of the other marches during pride weekend is a symptom of the selective advocacy of the corporate glbt movement which excludes trans people poor people and people of color
8070996 this march was created to draw attention to and protest that and with the help of the cops we certainly succeeded
8070997 the 21st century george and his show are being promoted on their own web site
8070998 sometimes i feel like im not like everyone else on the inside even though i look like everyone else on the outside
8070999 nadie cree m s en lo que hacemos que nosotros mismos
8071000 my glass isnt half full it isnt half empty its broken
8071001 harpercollins childrens books and online agency special ops media stepped into the armoire to create a bit of marketing magic
8071002 and the parts we regard as less honorable are those we clothe with the greatest care
8071003 if the rapture includes only a portion of those redeemed then the body of which christ is the head will be a dismembered and disfigured body when it is taken to him the building of which he is the chief cornerstone will be incomplete the priesthood of which he is the high priest will be without a portion of its complement the bride in relation to whom he is the bridegroom will be disfigured the new creation of which he is the head will be incomplete such is impossible to imagine
8071004 behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed
8071005 for if we believe that jesus died and rose again
8071006 the time of trouble which is coming upon the world to test all the people on earth
8071007 propitiation is the godward side of the work of christ on the cross
8071008 since the position of the world before god is completely changed through the death of christ gods own attitude toward man cannot longer be the same
8071009 redemption is an act of god by which he himself pays as a ransom the price of human sin which the outraged holiness and government of god requires
8071010 this has been a relatively cool spring with a late bud break and now with the fires it kind of gives you a filtering effect from the sun things just get slower and slower were going to be picking in december
8071011 there are examples of smokiness from forest fires showing up in wines the conditions are there but it all depends if the signs are still there at harvest time

8071118 how can some aspects of the show be so consistently brilliant and other aspects be completely terrible
8071119 this shawn michaels chris jericho feud is borderline unwatchable i get it they hate each other just fight already
8071120 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
8071121 it is hard for me to say exactly the percentage of reduction of the brain since we did not use software to measure its volume but visually it is more than a 50 to 75 reduction
8071122 the whole brain was reduced frontal parietal temporal and occipital lobes on both left and right sides these regions control motion sensibility language vision audition and emotional and cognitive functions
8071123 the brain is very plastic and can adapt to some brain damage occurring in the pre and postnatal period when treated appropriately
8071124 what i find amazing to this day is how the brain can deal with something which you think should not be compatible with life
8071125 it is possible that our patients arguably excessive intake of sumatriptan which contains a sulfonamide group caused his sulfhaemoglobinaemia
8071126 the patient recovered uneventfully and stopped taking sumatriptan after discharge when seen five weeks after his last dose he was found to have no sulfhaemoglobin in his blood
8071127 it might be that a defect in the medullas serotonin system is inhibiting a babys ability to gasp
8071128 if the baby is then put through additional stresses such as overheating and overbundling and it is unable to meet those challenges then it may die
8071129 however i doubt that this is the only inherited or non modifiable risk factor
8071130 now weve found that these neurons depend on serotonin and if you take it away theres no gasping
8071131 er zijn twee geschiedenissen de offici le leugenachtige die onderwezen wordt en de geheime geschiedenis waar de echte oorzaken van de gebeurtenissen te vinden zijn een schandelijke geschiedenis
8071132 what the search for the truth about september 11 desperately needs right now is a zealous prosecutor somewhere in america someone like new orleans d a jim garrison willing to investigate and indict the 19 suspected hijackers as well as their still living associates to compel federal investigative agencies like the fbi to present at trial the evidence they have been sitting on
8071133 instead what we got was the recent 9 11 conference in san francisco where you could hear all about the bushs links to the nazis
8071134 if they can get you asking the wrong questions they dont have to worry about answers
8071135 i heard a plane i saw it i saw debris flying i guess it was hitting light poles
8071136 suddenly an airplane roared into view nearly shearing the roof off the trailer before slamming into the e ring it sounded like a missile buried in debris and covered with airplane fuel he was briefly listed by authorities as missing there were three loud thump thump thumps you could hear the metal cracking and crinkling and the explosion
8071137 so i got about 100 yards or so past the heliport and then all of the sudden i heard this loud screeching sound that just came out of nowhere and it intensified this huge whoosh and something made me look in my rearview mirror and by the time i looked up i saw the side of the pentagon explode at that point i realized you see at that point i didnt know it was a plane i thought it was a missile strike
8071138 with the pentagon to the left of my van at about 10 oclock on the dial of a clock i glanced at my watch to see if i was going to be late for my appointment at that moment i heard a very loud quick whooshing sound that began behind me and stopped suddenly in front of me and to my left in fractions of a second i heard the impact and an explosion the next thing i saw was the fireball i was convinced it was a missile it came in so fast it sounded nothing like an airplane i remember vividly that as i turned off my cell phone i was watching the almost serene image of thick pieces of flaming fiberglass insulation floating down onto the highway
8071139 here were talking about plastic knives and using an american airlines flight filled with our citizens and the missile to damage this building and similar inaudible that damaged the world trade center
8071140 object that can be thrown or hurled stone arrow bullet etc
8071141 the plane was about 150 yards away approaching from the west about 20 feet off the ground patterson said he said the plane which sounded like the high pitched squeal of a fighter jet flew over arlington cemetery so low that he thought it was going to land on i 395 he said it was flying so fast that he couldnt read any writing on the side the plane which appeared to hold about eight to 12 people headed straight for the pentagon but was flying as if coming in for a landing on a nonexistent runway
8071142 i saw what looked to be maybe a 20 passenger corporate jet no markings on the side coming in at a shallow angle like it was landing right into the side of the pentagon
8071143 i dont know whether i saw or heard it first this silver plane i immediately recognized it as an american airlines jet it came swooping in over the highway over my left shoulder straight across where my car was heading there was a burst of orange flame that shot out that i could see through the highway overpass then it was just black just black thick smoke the eeriest thing about it was that it was like you were watching a movie there was no huge explosion no huge rumbling on ground it just went pfff it wasnt what i would have expected for a plane that was not much more than a football field away from me
8071144 i saw pieces of what appeared to be small aircraft on the ground and the part of the building by the heliport had collapsed
8071145 i reached the west side of the building i saw a light post bent in half but when i looked at the site my brain could not resolve the fact that it was a plane because it only seemed like a small hole in the building no tail no wings no nothing shortly after 10 a m police yelled at people to get back just as were about to open the door to get into the building they start screaming theres another inbound plane for nearly 15 minutes they stood watching the pentagon burn and periodically checked the sky for another plane
8071146 we were watching reagan national airport through binoculars a short distance away the plane was a two engine turbo prop that flew up the river from national then it turned back toward the pentagon we thought it had been waved off and then it hit the building
8071147 at first we thought it was the jets that sometimes fly overhead however it appeared to be the engine was at full throttle first the plane knocked down a number of street lamp poles then headed directly for the pentagon and crashed on the lawn near the west side the pentagon
8071148 it was about 9 35 and i was looking out our 12th floor windows at 1600 wilson boulevard in rosslyn virginia and i watched this it looked like a commuter plane two engined come down from the south real low perceived right on and crashed right on into the pentagon i watched it come down real low over the trees and it just dipped down came down right over 395 right into the pentagon
8071149 jim sutherland a mortgage broker was driving near the pentagon at 9 40 a m when he saw a 737 airplane 50 feet over interstate 395 heading in a straight line into the side of the pentagon the fireball explosion that followed rocked his car drivers began pulling over to the side some taking pictures not quite believing what they were seeing
8071150 i believed at the time that it belonged to american airlines but i couldnt be sure it looked like a 737 and i so reported to authorities
8071151 i saw an american airlines 737 twin engine airliner strike the building
8071152 when you slam an aluminum aircraft at high velocity into a concrete structure its going to do exactly what we saw happen at the pentagon on 9 11
8071153 if you look at a frontal mass cross section of the plane you see a cylinder of aluminum skin with stringers when it impacts with the exterior pentagon wall at 700 800 feet per second much of the kinetic energy of the plane converts to thermal energy and much of the aluminum converts to vapor burning to aluminum oxide thats why on the still photos from pentagon surveillance camera you first see the frame with that brilliant white luminescent flash just before the frame of the orange fireball the jet fuel burning the aluminum cylinder the plane fuselage is acting like a shaped charge penetrating a steel plate it keeps penetrating until it is consumed the boeing 757 is over 150 feet long so its going to penetrate quite a ways before its spent the wings have a much lower mass cross section and are loaded with fuel besides so there is little left of them except small bits and pieces
8071154 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
8071155 how can some aspects of the show be so consistently brilliant and other aspects be completely terrible
8071156 this shawn michaels chris jericho feud is borderline unwatchable i get it they hate each other just fight already
8071157 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
8071158 im not gay not that theres anything wrong with it
8071159 but you cant tell anyone because hes a school teacher
8071160 was that all the radio stations played patsy cline and an occasional tornado broke the monotony
8071161 i looked at the literature for new mexico state university and all i saw was the mountains and its where i wanted to go
8071162 my sister and i became closer once we left our parents home
8071163 she sat there listening to me not in the least comprehending what i was saying
8071164 i looked forward everyday to standing in front of those kids and giving it my best shot it has always been hard but its always been worth it
8071165 but every day i would go home to this wonderful woman and although i loved her deeply i didnt feel anything
8071166 i kept looking for something that would explain what i was going through but in those days there was no such thing as gay literature except veiled references about gertrude stein and alice b toklas
8071167 i was like a kid reading under the covers of my bed with a flashlight he said
8071168 it was both a sense of relief and a sense of dread finally i was beginning to understand my sexual nature but i couldnt discuss it with anyone
8071169 once she got over how appalling this was considering how we had grown up
8071170 it took me months to come to terms with what i had to do
8071171 i was feeling like a fraud standing up in front of all those young kids and trying to set an example and then going home to irene and keeping up another facade with her she wanted children
8071172 finally one afternoon i stopped at the flower store and bought a bouquet
8071173 i had a very difficult time explaining to her what i had been going through and what i had discovered
8071174 i didnt have the vocabulary and she couldnt grasp what i was trying to explain we stayed up all night talking and by morning everything had changed
8071175 i couldnt wait to get into the classroom and i felt lost when the final bell rang
8071176 one day irene came by tears streaming down her cheeks we sat on a park bench and talked for hours
8071177 she spent the night and we just held each other until we dozed off
8071178 but they were also confused because irene and i laughed through the whole thing
8071179 in fact i didnt have any idea of how this homosexual thing worked i just assumed i would always be alone get a dog grow old and die
8071180 irene and i had a divorce party and we invited everyone
8071181 this friend of a friend came and we got to talking
8071182 its like when you walk into a roomful of strangers and you know who is hispanic and speaks spanish you just know
8071183 as i was reading the thing there was a line that said the school board could terminate without due process or explanation any teacher who engaged in deviant or indecent behavior
8071184 thats when i started digging a hole and went underground
8071185 a couple of days later my father called and said dont bother coming
8071186 they took her to their preacher who told her she must denounce and shun me as my parents had done
8071187 you know is that the best they can do bigots are always distinguished by their lack of imagination and are always willing to make a public display of their stupidity
8071188 things have changed a lot and very little has changed
8071189 i now have teenagers in my classes who are gay boys and girls
8071190 whats that saying bad men do what good men dream
8071191 but the moment passes and another moment comes along and another one after that
8071192 having one of my kids called a faggot or hearing another kid call someone else a faggot
8071193 i dont know how that started i think i used it to identify myself to other gay men it seemed to give us something in common a language inflection again you as a spanish speaking hispanic have told me you can tell instantly when someone is a native spanish speaker even when they are communicating in english

8071201 ik heb tussen januari en mei 1993 bij de vakbond setca in nijvel gewerkt met de heer richard de groot aan het einde van mijn contract kwam ik weer zonder werk te zitten op 2 januari 1994 kreeg ik weer een baantje bij de socialistische partij in brussel bij meneer jean michel nottebaert ik heb daar tot augustus 1995 gewerkt op het dinantplein in brussel in die tijd vroeg meneer nottebaert hem te vergezellen naar de kelder waar ik tegen betaling zijn masochistische behoeftes moest bevredigen hij vroeg me nooit om sex met hem te bedrijven hij wilde alleen maar pijn lijden de kelderruimte leidde zowel naar de parkeergarage als naar de bibliotheek waar zich de archieven van de partij bevinden ik heb aan zijn verzoeken voldaan omdat ik niet genoeg geld verdiende om mijn gezin te onderhouden in die periode bij de socialistische partij ben ik door richard de groot eveneens voorgesteld aan meneer roger labarbe die toen nationaal voorzitter was van de setca de groot had me gezegd dat hij een vriend had die graag aan orgie n wilde deelnemen ik zou er goed voor betaald worden om die reden ben ik met hem meegegaan en ontmoette labarbe in een hotel in de rue des bergers vervolgens ben ik samen met de groot in zijn auto gestapt en zijn we naar st trond gereden naar een zaak die de hoeve bornedries heette een club voor partenerruil die volgens de groot en labarbe toebehoorde aan guy coeme zij hadden er lol in om mij bezig te zien met andere aanwezigen terwijl zij zich vermaakten met andere dames wij zijn daar regelmatig met zijn drie n geweest maar heel wat frequenter in een priv club die toentertijd la lune des pirates heette

8071203 daarnaast hebben de koning en de koningin ook goede kennissen die hun interesses delen zo iemand is de antiquair axel vervoordt op zondag laat de koningin zich naar verluidt geregeld nar zijn kasteel in sgravenwezel brengen om er het antiek te bekijken koffie te drinken en door de prachtige tuin te wandelen
8071204 tijdens gesprekken die ik met armand van ghyseghem voerde excuseerde hij zich openlijk voor zijn pedofilie hij vertelde me dat hij kleine meisjes besteeg die in ijzeren kooien waren opgesloten meisjes van vijf om precies te zijn ik weet ookdat hij regelmatig naar thailand nepal en india ging waar hij zijn tijd doorbracht met het botvieren van zijn lusten wat ik daarover verder nog weet is dat hij in het verleden al een paar keer veroordeeld is geweest en zelfs al heeft gezeten voor pedofilie in belgi ik weet ook dat hij uit zijn ouderlijke rechten is gezet omdat hij zelfs moeite had om van zijn eigen kinderen af te blijven zijn laatste echtgenote durfde hem nooit alleen te laten met hun jongste baby die in 1994 was geboren ik voeg hier nog aan toe dat hij deel uitmaakte van een satanische secte maurice josten die een tijdje directeur is geweest van multidiffusion heeft me wel eens laten weten dat er tijdens een zwarte mis van die secte ook ooit een dode was gevallen zonder dat nader te preciseren op een dag toen hij het met mij over die secte had vertelde van ghyseghem mij dat zijn advocaat mr van overstraete ook lid ervan was net als hoge magistraten en politiecommissarissen maar daar gaf hij de namen niet van hij zei dat hij hoge politieke bescherming genoot en schepte er zelfs over op dat heel wat zaken de doofpot ingingen dankzij zijn relaties van verschillende bronnen bijvoorbeeld mevrouw charlier in brussel heb ik vernomen dat van ghyseghem protectie ontving van charles piqu minister van economische zaken red van zowel jacqueline juin journalist bij de brtf en van een zekere jacques lejeune uit jumet dat de waalse red minister van cauwenbergh ook betrokken is bij een onnoemelijk aantal zaken met name in pedofiele kringen
8071205 er werd doorgetrokken en door de klapdeur verscheen het hoofd van de nederlandse geheime dienst uitgewoond maar opgelucht
8071206 maurice en leopold lippens de een de baas van fortis de ander de keizer van knokke het zijn bisexuelen pedofielen echte monsters op sexueel gebied monsters omdat ze per seance 6 tot 8 kinderen van 12 tot 14 jaar eisen alles gebeurt in nederland en telkens weer op een andere locatie ze arriveren daar vermomd en ze dragen een baret zij eisen dat alle kinderen licht onder alcoholische invloed zijn ze kiezen er vier uit twee jongens en twee wijvekes dat is het woord dat maurice altijd gebruikt en dan beginnen de gruwelijkheden de slachtoffers reppen over sodomie bij de jongens en penetratie bij de meisjes plus nog een nummertje pijpen door die twee en door de kinderen onderling zon seance kost 1500 gulden per keer ze zijn ook zon 5 6 keer in sevilla geweest ze reizen dan via nederland of luxemburg onder een andere naam en worden in die landen nooit gecontroleerd bij een psychiatrisch onderzoek zou de hele zaak meteen naar boven komen en ze zouden breken sinds de affaire dutroux hebben ze al hun fotocassettes in knokke vernietigd de gebroeders lippens zijn super machtig ze hebben de pers en een deel van de magistratuur in hun zak zitten en zijn beiden multimiljonair u bent dus gewaarschuwd evenals mensen uit ander disciplines ze zullen alles doen om deze zaak in de doofpot te stoppen vanzelfsprekend gebruiken ze opwekkende middelen
8071207 betreft graaf leopold lippens en maurice lippens alleen de rijken en machtigen kunnen u bewegen te zeggen dat het om laster gaat zonder bewijs de pers heeft alles wat we u verteld hebben over die monsterachtige topzakenlieden die rustig 300 tot 900 000 francs neertellen voor een videocassette met geen tang aangeraakt de gebroeders lippens hebben voor miljoenen aan pedo videomateriaal vernietigd leopold de grootste malloot van het duo is twee keer voor de rechter geweest een keer wegens een smerige sexaffaire zijn broer heeft aan de klagers een afkoopsom betaald en de beklaagde kreeg een voorwaardelijke straf leopold kreeg op zijn golfterrein ook nog eens bezoek van gendarmes voor een drugscontrole hij probeerde vergeefs ze als hoogste baas van de politie aan de deur af te poeieren maar ze hebben cocaine aangetroffen en geconfisceerd ook in dat geval werd een voorwaardelijke straf uitgesproken let wel deze gevallen werden behandeld in brugge waar de burgemeester op zijn zetel wordt gehouden door de gebroeders lippens wat betreft de pedofiliegevallen als u die tenminste opgelost wil zien zult u op de aanwijzingen die wij nog in petto hebben over de gebroeders lippens ontdekken dat tientallen kinderen voor hen behoed hadden kunnen worden wij hebben geen persoonlijk belang bij de ontmaskering van deze monsters op dit moment weten ze hun raadsman ervan te overtuigen dat er zonder bewijzen geen zaak is maar wij laten deze affaire niet los over de zaken die in brugge voor de rechter zijn geweest heeft geen enkele krant geschreven er waren zeker twaalf getuigen bij toen lippens coca ne aanbood op de golf die kleine affaire kan u op weg helpen naar de zware pedofiliegevallen

8071209 ik voelde me plotseling leeggezogen het was alsof ik niets meer in mij had ik was totaal leeg
8071210 ik vind het niet verwonderlijk dat de ouders van an zich afvragen of hun dochter nog onder invloed van hypnose was toen ze ontvoerd werd ik begrijp ook dat de familie marchal geen reconstructie in oostende meer vragen dat is heel zinnig gezien de houding van dutroux en lelievre want de thesis van ans vader wint veld het meisje is niet ontvoerd op de plaatsen die beide verdachten hebben aangeduid opvallend vind ik ook dat paul marchal zijn tevredenheid heeft geuit de manier waarop hij wordt bijgestaan door meester quirynen is daar zeker niet vreemd aan wat mij ook nog erg trof was dat toen de familie marchal aangifte deed van de verdwijning van hun dochter ze bleven in de kou staan ik ben zelf 6 jaar onderzoeksrechter geweest ik weet hoe dat gaat ouders worden vaak afgescheept ik vind dat zoiets niet kan iedere aangifte moet geakteerd worden
8071211 wij willen vooral vermijden dat het hier een circus wordt
8071212 opsluiten in een cel de deur op slot doen en de sleutel wegsmijten
8071213 er zijn maar een paar mensen in belgi die het hele massale dossier van dutroux hebben doorgenomen maar iedereen heeft hem al wel schuldig verklaard over de hele lijn de media hebben alle mogelijke inlichtingen gespuid wie kan nu nog volkomen onbevooroordeeld tegenover deze zaak staan
8071214 natuurlijk krijgt marc dutroux geen eerlijk proces geen schijn van kans iedereen k nt de feiten of d nkt dat via alle berichten die de pers nu al heeft doorgestroomd niemand voelt zich gehinderd door enige nuancering integendeel het leeuwendeel van onze bevolking heeft voor de hoofdverdachte al de absolute maximumstraf in gedachten moet er eigenlijk nog een dutroux proces komen voor de meeste belgen niet dat proces is al lang gemaakt massas mensen in ons land hebben mijn cli nt dutroux al dood en begraven verklaard ze willen zich desnoods nog wel eens buigen over de rol die jean michel nihoul heeft gespeeld maar over dutroux zelf liggen de meningen vast hoe ga je dan in die brede lagen van de bevolking een jury selecteren die er een ietsje anders over denkt dat lijkt me onhaalbaar
8071215 precies op de scheidingslijn perfect op het kruispunt waar de zogeheten believers en non believers mekaar treffen in mijn optiek is dutroux inderdaad de eenzame verkrachter geweest maar tegelijk ook de man die zich door winstbejag gedreven liet inhuren om meisjes te leveren aan gegoede klanten met rare voorkeuren daarbij ga ik de vraag stellen hoe is hij daartoe gekomen vanuit zijn jeugd vanuit zijn voorgeschiedenis
8071216 dat weet ik niet dat kan mijn enige hoop is dat naar mijn stelling geluisterd wordt en dat ik het tij van het vooroordeel kan keren
8071217 wie het tegendeel beweert heeft onvoldoende kennis van en ervaring met de assisenprocedure natuurlijk hebben alle mediafiguren die in de beschuldigdenbank terechtkomen een voorgeschiedenis in de pers het lijkt erop dat ze geen kans meer maken in de praktijk draait het vaak heel anders uit ik heb dat onder meer meegemaakt in de moordzaak van de vub rector renneboog die man was geportretteerd als een deugniet een lepe moordenaar die de dood van zijn vrouw als een accident had willen maskeren ook hij was op voorhand al aan het kruis genageld en dan komt de tegenstander de zaal binnen wat zie je dan het shock effect als de juryleden de man in levende lijve meemaken nee hij heeft g n tijgertanden nee het is g n baarlijk monster het is een beminnelijk man die zacht en beschaafd praat ineens beantwoordt hij niet meer aan het profiel dat van hem is geschetst bij de gezworenen is er een moment van verbazing een klik moment waarop het voorgekauwde verhaaltje langzaam maar zeker begint af te brokkelen vergeet niet de assisenprocedure is mondeling een defil van getuigen brengt nuanceringen aan de juryleden distanti ren zich van het beeld dat de media hebben opgehangen ze dompelen zich onder in de problematiek van het drama de buitenwereld vervaagt en valt weg de vooroordelen vallen stukje bij beetje weg dag na dag en aan het eind van het proces is de jury perfect in staat om een eigen en onafhankelijk oordeel uit te bouwen
8071218 de uitspraak voor dutroux ligt nu al vast dat wordt dus levenslang niemand in dit land kiest voor minder dat is de evidentie zelf kent u iemand die met een lagere straf genoegen neemt ik niet maar betekent dat nu dat dutroux geen fair proces kan krijgen als het criterium is dat de verdediging alle kansen moet krijgen om haar argumenten te ontwikkelen en haar thesis naar voren te brengen dan zeg ik ja dutroux kan in die optiek een eerlijk proces krijgen het is een h l andere vraag of iedereen ook de jury ook onbevangen kan luisteren naar die argumenten de dood van de ontvoerde meisjes heeft geen mens in ons land onberoerd gelaten we zitten dus t ch met een probleem mensen die tot tranen toe zijn bewogen en tot op de dag van vandaag bedolven worden onder een media bombardement die zitten dus ook in de jury gaan zij de argumentatie van de verdediging aanvaarden ik weet het niet vergeet vooral niet dat het visuele aspect in de media een grotere impact heeft dan een geschreven tekst de misdaden van dutroux worden nu zelfs op televisie nagespeeld het effect daarvan is niet te onderschatten ik ben daar niet gelukkig mee dit is ongewild en ongevraagd een media en showproces aan het worden het gevaar dreigt dat aan de essentie wordt voorbijgegaan hoe je het ook draait of keert het gaat om een vulgaire moord op kinderen ik verwijt deze procesvoering dat veel meer naar het bos dan naar boom wordt gekeken het had allemaal veel vlugger veel effici nter gekund zijn er netwerken aan te pas gekomen splits dat toch af waarom moeten een diefstal van een vrachtwagen in n adem behandeld worden met het lot van kinderen die na misbruik en mishandeling door uithongering stierven vele mensen begrijpen dat niet en ik ben daar n van
8071219 is perfect verstaanbaar de allerzwaarste misdaden trekken de grootste aandacht van de pers dat is overal ter wereld zo dat is zelfs van alle tijden bij het proces dutroux is dat nog m r het geval het gaat immers om kinderen de zwaksten in onze samenleving de foto van de kleine loubna bena ssa staat op ons netvlies gebrand net als de beelden van de andere vermiste meisjes uiteraard worden we dan overspoeld met een uitvoerige berichtgeving maar betekent dat ook dat de objectiviteit wordt geschaad daar geloof ik niet in voor mij gaat de openbaarheid van de assisenprocedure een garantie bieden voor de objectiviteit versta me niet verkeerd ik ben hoegenaamd geen voorstander van de assisenrechtspleging ik heb dat nooit verstopt ik vind het verkeerd dat de beoordeling van de allerzwaarste misdaden aan de beoordeling van lekenrechters wordt toevertrouwd men zou dat beter aan professionele magistraten overlaten als ik ziek ben ga ik naar mijn huisdokter en als het ernstig is stuurt die mij misschien door naar een specialist dat vind ik normaal voor kleinere vergrijpen oordelen correctionele rechters maar als het over halsmisdaden gaat doodslag en moord worden burgers ingeschakeld mensen die geen studie van jaren hebben gevolgd en die niet de kans hebben gekregen om het dossier te bestuderen ik beweer niet dat deze mensen niet te goeder trouw zijn maar deze verschrikkelijke zaak had ik liever aan beroepsrechters toevertrouwd gezien maar om terug te keren tot de kern van uw vraag ja dutroux krijgt een rechtvaardig en eerlijk proces daar staat de openbaarheid van de debatten garant voor ik heb overigens erg positieve herinneringen aan de parlementaire dutroux commissie dat was politiek werk rond een afschuwelijke affaire we hadden een controlerende functie en we hebben daar nuttig werk verricht
8071220 wie jarenlang sociaal afwijkend gedrag vertoont en dan druk ik mij nog zacht uit
8071221 die moet niet beginnen te klagen als er ook grote maatschappelijke aandacht wordt gewijd aan zijn wandaden wie wind zaait zal storm oogsten dat is ook zo in de affaire dutroux wie jarenlang in het duister de meest verderfelijke zaken heeft uitgespookt moet zich achteraf niet beklagen over het daglicht dat schijnt over zijn misdaden waarom zou dutroux geen eerlijk proces kunnen krijgen het is best mogelijk dat kandidaat juryleden op dit moment als ze alle bekijken bij zichzelf denken waar gaan we onze tijd aan verdoen ik houd het zelfs voor mogelijk dat ze denken tegen de muur zetten en doodschieten die man maar evengoed ben ik er zeker van dat er zich een metamorfose voordoet van zodra ze van leek tot rechter worden dat gaat in alle assisenzaken zo dan wordt het mogelijk dat ze de man die terechtstaat vrijspreken voor sommige details voor onderdelen van de beschuldiging natuurlijk ligt zijn uiteindelijke strafmaat al vast hoe kan het anders de dode meisjes zijn allemaal misbruikt weinstein is vermoord en dutroux heeft dat allemaal gedaan n bekend hoe kan zon man dan minder dan levenslang krijgen een handvol doden stel je dat maar voor ik ben het er niet mee eens dat de pers nu met de vinger wordt gewezen dutroux z lf heeft zich definitief uitgesloten en afgekeerd van de maatschappij de media hebben alleen maar verslag gegeven van wat hij misdaan heeft en wat hij bekend heeft aan wie de schuld dan toch niet aan de boodschapper alleen aan de dader
8071222 vader paul en moeder betty zijn zeker niet uit op blinde wraak geheel volgens de principes van de rechtsstaat gunnen ze zelfs meneer dutroux een eerlijk proces ook met de mogelijkheid dat hij vrijgepleit wordt voor de zaken die hij betwist ze verwachten wel dat iedereen die aantreedt op het assisenproces constructief meewerkt om de hele waarheid te zoeken zelfs van de hoofdverdachte marc dutroux wordt dat gehoopt of dat alles op een objectieve manier kan gebeuren dat zal vooral afhangen van de houding van de assisenvoorzitter het is onze grootste wens dat die op een gezagsvolle wijze de debatten gaat leiden waarbij hij iedereen op zn rechten en plichten wijst ondertussen vinden wij het erg verwerpelijk dat zoveel gelekt is te grabbel gegooid wie dat gedaan heeft of georganiseerd heeft is op een onverantwoorde manier tewerk gegaan het is zeker niet van de burgerlijke partijen uitgegaan voor ons blijft het geheim van het onderzoek een heilig principe en laten we vooral niet vergeten voor alle heisa rond deze zaak zijn alleen maar dutroux en zn bende verantwoordelijk niemand anders
8071223 staan voor een aartsmoeilijke opdracht ik wil graag geloven dat iedereen in aarlen ernaar streeft om dit proces een correct geding te laten worden maar voor hetzelfde geld wordt het een pro forma vertoning spijtig voor mijn collegas advocaten maar de verdedigers van dutroux hebben niets in handen volgens mij kunnen ze alleen maar pleiten vanuit een wanhoopsstrategie om het beeld dat de publieke opinie van hun cli nt heeft in een iets positievere zin om te buigen ik vind dat die mensen voor een hopeloze taak staan
8071224 als ik sta te pleiten doe ik dat liefst voor professionele magistraten maar evengoed heb ik het grootste vertrouwen in de juryrechtspraak al zijn de gezworenen de moeilijkste rechters die er zijn onze grondwet heeft zeer terecht de beoordeling van de zwaarste misdaden toevertrouwd aan lekenrechters aan de burgers onder ons iedere keer weer zie ik ze geleidelijk aan wijzer worden na enkele dagen zijn ze perfect in staat om de mediatisering te vergeten de glans en de glamour het klatergoud van de eerste dag van zich af te schudden
8071225 ik heb an en eefje ontvoerd geholpen door leli vre die kende een net dat de meisjes wilde kopen voor 100 000 frank om ze te prostitueren leli vre is met de meisjes vertrokken en iets later heeft hij mij betaald
8071226 ik wil dutroux laten zien dat hij mij niet heeft klein gekregen ik zal hem recht in de ogen kijken en hij zal zien dat ik er nog altijd sta
8071227 ik heb werk en ik probeer een gewoon leven te leiden
8071228 daarom heb ik al die tijd gezwegen ik wil niet dat iedereen mij ziet als het ontvoerde meisje ik wil dat de mensen de echte sabine dardenne zien
8071229 omdat de pers mij achtervolgde journalisten stonden tot in de living die aandacht werd ondraaglijk voor een klein meisje ik had maar een wens geef mij een normaal leven nu het proces eraan komt kan ik niet langer zwijgen ik wil dat de mensen de waarheid horen
8071230 ik wil dutroux recht in de ogen kijken hem bewijzen dat ik leef en dat ik er bovenop ben ik maak me geen illusies het proces zal ongelooflijk zwaar zijn wat mij is overkomen zal mij altijd blijven achtervolgen maar ik wil absoluut getuigen ik wil dutroux laten zien dat hij er niet in geslaagd is mij klein te krijgen ik heb dit overleefd omdat ik een sterk karakter heb het ligt niet in mijn aard om het snel op te geven
8071231 ik wil niet dat iemand nog twijfelt aan mijn woorden de donkere punten in het dossier moeten worden uitgeklaard
8071232 marc dutroux heeft me van alles wijsgemaakt hij was een grote manipulator en leugenaar hij vertelde me zelfs dat ik zijn nieuwe vrouw was
8071233 toen ze me hebben bevrijd ben ik naar het politiebureau gebracht daar heeft men mij verteld dat hij de slechterik was ik was zo kwaad over alles wat hij me had voorgelogen dat ik hem wilde opzoeken in zijn cel en hem de huid wilde vol schelden
8071234 hij vond dat hij alles kon hij vond zichzelf fantastisch zo ging hij prat op een schouw die op de gelijkvloerse verdieping stond het was het mooiste in het huis en dat had hij zelf gemaakt zei hij hij is gek iemand die zulke dingen doet is niet normaal
8071235 ik geloof niet dat marc dutroux nog veel onthullingen gaat doen op het proces ik hoop alleen dat hij niet begint met zijn spijt te betuigen want dan ga ik steigeren veel verwacht ik niet ik hoop alleen dat hij veroordeeld wordt dat hij niet meer vrijkomt nooit meer toch vrees ik dat er een achterpoortje is waardoor hij nog kan ontglippen
8071236 met michel nihoul erbij wordt het een heel ander proces
8071237 een aantal dingen zijn nog niet geweten of beter gezegd op zijn minst nog niet duidelijk
8071238 tientallen journalisten hebben de dvds met daarop het volledige dossier vierhonderdduizend paginas dik in handen ze hebben die beelden gezien maken er melding van we vinden dat vreselijk anderen hebben geen recht op die informatie onze kinderen willen ook niet alles weten maar op die manier worden ze gedwongen om te weten wat ze niet willen weten
8071239 er zijn ook nog de grootouders er zijn dingen die mijn ma leest en hoort in haar onderbewuste denkt ze och het zal allemaal wel niet zo erg zijn geweest zij kan die informatie niet aan maar ik weet dat het waar is
8071240 zijn behandeling in de gevangenis ieder mens wil overleven in zijn geval goed overleven of alles verliezen zijn zwijgen is eigenlijk een levensverzekering een verzekering voor meer luxe en comfort dat begrijp ik dutroux gaat kijken hoe ver hij kan gaan hij is slim en leep weet wat er ook het spel staat ook al staat hij met zijn rug tegen de muur
8071241 dat is ook mijn idee ik merk dat aan alle kleine dingen wordt hem een vraag gesteld uit het dossier dan volgt het perfecte antwoord tot in het kleinste detail
8071242 ik kan de dingen gekleurd vertellen maar ook heel sec net zoals ze in het dossier staan
8071243 als hij iets hoort of leest dat niet correct is steigert hij
8071244 er was een tijd dat ik dagelijks met het dossier bezig was ik heb het dossier ook meer dan n keer gelezen
8071245 ik ken het dossier niet ik ontdek nog dagelijks dingen in de media die ik wist ik verdiep mij niet in het dossier omdat ik vrees om gruwelijke dingen te lezen ik kan heel veel verdragen zolang het maar allemaal waar is als ik echter hoor of lees dat an tien keer verkracht is en het is maar zes keer dan vind ik dat erg bij twijfel vraag ik het aan paul zegt hij dat het waar is dan geloof ik dat
8071246 de kinderen hebben een verschillende kijk op de gebeurtenissen ze willen zo weinig mogelijk met de pers te maken hebben ze zijn er als de dood voor nooit gedacht dat dit zon impact op hen zou hebben ze willen met rust gelaten worden en ik wil dat die wens wordt gerespecteerd op het moment dat hun privacy wordt geschonden praat ik niet meer met de pers
8071247 ik denk dat ik een klein beetje weet wat an heeft meegemaakt ik kan de knop omdraaien maar praat er ook veel over tegen de hond als ik alleen ben tegen karen met wie ik elke dag ga wandelen zij is het klankbord ook met sommige collegas praat ik er veel over nu zien we gelukkig het einde we kunnen een bladzijde omslaan we kunnen met een nieuw leven beginnen nu voel ik me nog geleefd
8071248 ik weet niet hoe hij het zal doen maar hem kennende zal hij dat weer wel fiksen
8071249 een mooie regeling ik kan naar het proces gaan wanneer ik wil ik zal er wel niet elke dag zijn ik moet er nog zijn voor de kinderen
8071250 we moet verder met ons leven met ons gezin ik wil na afloop wel in de spiegel kunnen kijken en zeggen dat ik alles heb gedaan om de waarheid aan het licht te brengen alleen dan kan ik verder de dood van an zal altijd een litteken achterlaten maar ik kan niet de rest van mijn leven met marc dutroux bezig blijven
8071251 de zaak ddutroux in het hele boek worden dutroux martin leli vre en nihoul nvdr met een kleine letter geschreven houdt ons land nu al bijna negen jaar in de ban dat is meer dan de helft van de leeftijd die an mijn oudste maar inmiddels jongste kind haalde de ervaring in die jaren leerde me dat mensen snel vergeten en vaak ook informatie hebben gemist ik wil daarom een kroniek maken van de feiten in de rand maar ik wil ook aantonen hoe gruwelijke feiten als deze je leven grondig overhoop gooien ik vertel hoe ik daarmee ben omgegaan en wat ik daarbij allemaal ben tegengekomen maar ook wat ik heb bereikt
8071252 in geen geval heb ik een samenvatting van het dossier gemaakt ik heb simpelweg de jaren 1995 tot 2004 een beetje willen schetsen je kind komt dutroux en leli vre tegen en bijna negen jaar later gaan we naar het proces dat wil ik schetsen
8071253 ik reken vanaf de verdwijning een jaar eerder sommigen zeggen nog steeds mijnheer ik schrijf zijn naam al lang niet meer met een hoofdletter
8071254 een relaas van als verdriet wordt omgezet in een strijd en wat je allemaal tegenkomt en hoe je je voelt fiction leek het non fiction was het gedurende meer dan acht jaar
8071255 al hebben ze me an afgepakt toch heb ik nog altijd een gezin waar ik trots op ben betty karen kris en gert ook al toon ik dat niet altijd ik hou van jullie en zou even veel even lang en met dezelfde inspanningen doen voor jullie wat ik nu voor an heb gedaan ik hoop alleen maar dat ik het niet hoef te bewijzen bedankt om een schakel te zijn in ons gezin en bedankt om de schakel an in onze ketting te bewaren
8071256 dutroux was vanaf 96 gewoon een naam toen ik hem voor de eerste keer op de raadkamer zag had ik hem enkel gezien op foto en op tv het is allemaal moeilijk te verwoorden je weet dat je hem zal zien je bent nerveus en daar is hij dan hij beweegt hij krijgt een gezicht wordt mens er gaat vanalles door je heen je wilt wat doen sla ik hem trek ik het wapen van de rijkswachter die naast hem loopt en schiet ik hem neer
8071257 je kijkt verder en wat je dan ziet is ook weer moeilijk uit te leggen je ziet een gewone man die mijn boekhouder of wie dan ook zou kunnen zijn hij praat en ziet er gewoon normaal uit is d t nu het monster het gezicht van het kwaad dan is er een andere gedachte hoe kun je zo zijn er is maar n verklaring dutroux is niet normaal niet gezond opsluiten die man nooit meer vrijlaten
8071258 zie ons hier zitten we zijn in al die jaren andere mensen geworden we zijn bijna acht jaar verder waarom heeft het in godsnaam zo lang moeten duren
8071259 toch ga ik naar het proces ik wil weten wat er met mijn dochter is gebeurd vanaf het moment dat zij is ontvoerd tot het einde ik wil weten hoe zij is gestorven en wanneer dat blijkt niet genoeg uit het dossier ook over de ontvoering wil ik meer weten hoe is de reis verlopen waar is ze naartoe gebracht eefje is tot twee keer toe kunnen ontsnappen waarom is ze niet weggeraakt was ze te zwak onder invloed waarom is ze niet van het dak gesprongen
8071260 eefje was geen kind meer een jonge vrouw dat we voor haar geen losgeld zouden willen betalen zoals dutroux de andere kinderen heeft wijsgemaakt zal ze nooit geloofd hebben maar ik wil weten hoe ze het allemaal heeft ervaren wat in haar leefde ik vrees dat we het nooit te weten zullen komen en laat dit duidelijk zijn ik wil me niet alleen focussen op dutroux ook op de anderen michelle martin en michel leli vre hebben een even belangrijke rol gespeeld maar welke vraag is of ze meer weten dan ze tot nu toe hebben verteld ik denk het wel en ik wil het allemaal uit hun mond te horen krijgen
8071261 jij ondergaat alles gelaten en sereen mensen respecteren dat bewonderen je er voor ik heb je op dezelfde manier meegemaakt tijdens de zittingen waar dutroux op een meter van je afstond ik wist dat je het heel moeilijk had maar toch bleef je kalm bleef je jean ik heb je ook nooit boos gezien
8071262 dutroux kijkt nooit op hij kijkt je nooit recht in de ogen misschien kan ik me daarom inhouden ik weet het niet de eerste keer dat ik hem zag voelde ik me heel onwennig angstig zelfs toen die gevoelens weg waren had ik het moeilijk om me in te houden de man het kwaad kreeg een gezicht en als je daar op doordenkt
8071263 aan de naam dutroux de naam is heel gemakkelijk uit te spreken hangt ook een man vast een man die door en door slecht is er zit niets positiefs in ik weet niet wat ik zou doen als ik hem ergens alleen zou treffen maar iets in elk geval
8071264 jean is niet de man met de blinde haat maar met gerechtvaardigde wraak en haatgevoelens het kwaad is er en het moet weg voor altijd
8071265 komt er met het proces een einde aan het dutroux tijdperk
8071266 ik hoop het in al die jaren is er nog altijd die pijn die slijt niet eefje zal nooit vergeten worden maar ik wil verder ik heb ook nog een zoon leendert hij is 21 na het proces wil ik van de gebeurtenissen afstandnemen dat zal wellicht nooit lukken toch niet echt
8071267 ik blijf op hotel ik kreeg net zoals de andere ouders een gratis kamer aangeboden door de hotelbaas ik waardeer dat enorm dat iemand nog zo onbaatzuchtig is vergeet niet dat er financi le consequenties aan deze gebeurtenissen zijn
8071268 al 8 jaar behandelt joris mijn dossier als die al zijn uren zou doorgerekend hebben kon ik hem al lang niet meer betalen we kunnen na het proces maximaal 2 miljoen frank krijgen uit het fonds voor slachtoffers van opzettelijke gewelddaden dat geld zal snel op zijn acht jaar is lang
8071269 we hebben altijd een goede regeling getroffen ik heb nog geen geld gevraagd op het proces gaat jean lambrecks zich burgerlijke partij stellen en schadevergoeding eisen er valt echter niets te rapen dutroux heeft niets meer
8071270 het proces zal een hele tijd duren en dan mag en moet het allemaal ophouden voor mij maar ook voor leendert voor de hele familie moet er zo snel mogelijk een einde aan komen net als ik worden zij er constant over aangesproken
8071271 het is akelig om vast te stellen hoeveel goede man en vrouwkracht verloren gaat aan dit proces hoeveel energie er moet worden gestoken in de vervolging van beklaagden van wie eigenlijk al vaststaat welke hun lot zal zijn goed dat het nu begint dan komt er een einde aan
8071272 wij hebben een verdachte opgepakt zijn naam is dutroux marc dutroux
8071273 niet het antwoord op de vraag wat het meisje heeft doorstaan dat weet zij beter dan eender wie w l dat er zware sancties komen voor al diegenen die verantwoordelijk zijn voor wat dit kind is aangedaan plus het antwoord op de vraag wat dutroux kan bezield hebben en liefst ook een zware straffen voor al die mensen rond de hoofdverdachte die hem geholpen en of ge nspireerd hebben
8071274 ik wil geen verwijten van de burgers op straat dat ik betaald word met hun belastinggeld
8071275 ik hoop dat de waarheid aan het licht komt en niets dan de waarheid
8071276 het ergste wat van die man kan gezegd worden is dat hij een onprettig karakter heeft maar met de ontvoering van laetitia delhez heeft hij niets te maken dat gaan we ook pleiten ook in de drugsdelicten die hem ten laste worden gelegd moet hij vrijuit gaan hij werkte als informant voor de justitie in opdracht
8071277 hij was actief als politie informant en dat is niet mijn opinie dat staat zwart op wit te lezen in de interne rapporten van de rijkswacht
8071278 mij veroordelen voor feiten die ik niet gepleegd heb dat zou neerkomen op de poort naar de waarheid definitief sluiten
8071279 mientras los personajes de la serie estaban haciendo otras cosas

8071287 but i thought his father was kenyan how could mr obama not be african american how could his ethnic composition be so arabic
8071288 he took advantage of an opportunity that wasnt expected by me or by him
8071289 they just said hey roy we want you to start taking some snaps at safety and learn some safety
8071290 i started studying my playbook and started learning all the db positions whether its nickel dime or safety so that if i was thrown into those positions i would know what to do its helped me understand the whole concept of the defense
8071291 while they were here grinding and working i was just back at school doing double duty going to class and working out and studying my book so i would be caught up i didnt know exactly what i was missing so in order to prepare for everything i made sure i was well rounded in everything i was doing
8071292 more than anything what hes done is cast a bigger net
8071293 hes shown that hes capable of doing multiple things and bettering his chances of being a part of this thing hes very deliberate for a guy whos moving from corner to safety he didnt shy away from any contact
8071294 this is not an autobiography it is rather a kind of curriculum vitae my attempt to show how one writer was formed its a work unlike any i have read as so many of this books are in that it entertains and instructs at the same time and it doesnt lecture it
8071295 mungkin dulu sebagai budak sekolah dan sebagai tokoh pemuda umno maka mudah bercakap untuk mengharamkan judi dan memansuhkan riba tetapi sebagai menteri kewangan tidaklah boleh bercakap sebagai budak sekolah dan sebagai ketua pemuda setakat ini tidak ramai yang percaya anwar akan mengaharamkan judi bukan dia tidak mahu tetapi tidak terdaya untuk melaksanakannya kerana umno tidak berpendirian begitu jika lesen judi diteruskan juga maka samalah dia dengan saudagar judi dan kaki judi
8071296 jelaslah di sini kelantan yang dikuasai barisan nasional judi terus berleluasa
8071297 sebarang percubaan untuk meletakkan islam kepada suatu sistem yang masih membenarkan riba dan arak pemerasan dan perjudian adalah suatu penghinaan terhadap islam
8071298 apa yang patut dibuat oleh kerajaan ialah mengenakan cukai yang lebih tinggi ke atas perjudian untuk syarikat syarikat seperti magnum sport toto big sweep dan lain lain yang sentiasa memperolehi keuntungan besar dengan senangnya akan tetapi selama dua tahun berturut turut di bawah yb dato seri anwar ibrahim sebagai menteri kewangan perjudian telah dikecualikan daripada sebarang penambahan cukai perkara ini seandai menggambarkan dengan jelas bahawa yb dato seri anwar ibrahim amat menyokong perjudian dakwaan yang beliau adalah seorang pemimpin islam hanyalah topeng untuk memperbodohkan rakyat jelata sahaja
8071299 bahawa semua rakyat mengetahui bahawa perjudian mendatangkan bencana untuk masyarakat dan sebenarnya telah memecahbelahkan banyak keluarga dalam hal ini kerajaan barisan nasional sepatutnya mengenakan kadar cukai yang lebih tinggi untuk perjudian bagi mencegah aktiviti aktiviti ini dalam negara kita sebaliknya jelas hari ini sehingga ini kerajaan bn sedang menggalakkan industri perjudian untuk berkembang kita semua tahu kenapa kerajaan bn tidak menaikkan kadar cukai ke atas perjudian saya pasti semua rakyat mengetahui tentang hubungan di antara yb dato seri anwar ibrahim menteri kewangan dan yab dato seri dr mahathir perdana menteri dengan tan sri vincent tan dan encik ananda krishnan kita juga tahu bahawa baru baru ini yb dato seri anwar ibrahim pergi ke johor baharu dengan helikopter untuk perasmian persidangan umno baru johor saya percaya bahawa tan sri vincent tan telah menyewakan helikopter tersebut untuk beliau saya telah diberitahu oleh sumber yang boleh layak dipercayai bahawa tan sri vincent tan telah dikurniakan tanah konsesi yang sangat besar di pulau redang dan pulau tioman dengan harga yang murah saya juga telah dimaklumkan bahawa selepas itu tan sri vincent tan telah menjualkan tanah tanah konsesi di dua pulau ini kepada berjaya group of companes dengan harga beberapa ratus juta ringggit daripada kenyataan di atas kami dapat melihat dengan jelasnya kenapa kerajaan tetap enggan untuk mengenakan kadar cukai yang tinggi untuk industri perjudian walaupun kebanyakan rakyat membenci perjudian
8071300 apabila slogan slogan tersebut telah diumumkan oleh yab dato seri dr mahathir pada masa itu rasuah penyalahgunaan kuasa dan nepotisme terus berkembang dan digalakkan contohnya ialah skandal bmf rm2 5 bilion epf makuwasa projek uem lebuhraya utara selata skandal sepuluh juta saham telekom dihijack oleh presiden mic jualan beratus ratus ekar tanah yang berharga di bukit kiara kepada tan sri vincent tan dan sebuah syarikat di singapura yang bernama lum chang holdings ltd untuk lebih kurang satu juta ringgit seekar
8071301 kita juga perlu lebih peka dan waspada terhadap perebutan rasuah dan penyalahgunaan kuasa kerajaan mempunyai tanggungjawab menjaga kewibawaan dan melindungi imej bersihnya dan tidak akan membiarkan seekor kerbau membawa lumpur habis semua terpalit
8071302 you can fool some of the people some of the time but not all the people all the time
8071303 jika yb menteri kewangan menganggap beliau bersih saya harap beliau dapat jawab perkara perkara berikut
8071304 kerajaan mempunyai tanggungjawab menjaga kewibawaan dan melindungi imej bersihnya dan tidak akan membiarkan seekor kerbau membawa lumpur hampir semua terpalit
8071305 jika beliau tidak dapat memberhentikan dengan izin scandalous land transactions ini beliau lebih baik lupakan impiannya untuk menjadi perdana menteri kerana beliaulah yang sepatutnya disiasat atas hubungannya dengan pelbagai penyelewengan yang berlaku
8071306 di bidang ekonomi kita juga menyaksikan keadaan yang tidak kurang ngerinya
8071307 pembangunan ala kapitalis yang bersifat urban bias telah mengabaikan majoriti rakyat di perdesaan kerana pembangunannya terlalu menumpu ke bandar
8071308 kita patut bertanya syarikat manakah yang memiliki sebahagian besar daripada hartanah yang paling mahal di ibu kota siapakah yang akan mendapat kontrak membina sistem pembentungan najis yang bernilai enam ribu juta ringgit siapakah yang mendapat keuntungan daripada pembangunan pulau langkawi pulau redang dan pulau layang layang siapakah taukeh besar pusat rekreasi bukit kiara di ibu kota siapakah yang menjadi broker kepada kepada memorandum persefahaman membeli senjata moden yang bernilai beribu ribu juta ringgit syarikat milik siapakah yang paling banyak disenaraikan di bursa saham kuala lumpur siapa yang akan memiliki kekayaan hartanah di kawasan stadium merdeka dan stadium negara apabila ia kawasan stadium merdeka dan stadium negara apabila ia dirobohkan kelak syarikat swasta manakah yang paling beruntung daripada krisis tenaga hari ini apakah penoreh getah yang mendapatmya adakah kaum nelayan dan peneroka felda yang memiliki saham dalam syarikat syarikat tadi kenapa di saat negara ketiadaan wang untuk membayar bonus dan menyediakan skim perumahan kepada kakitangannya serta menambahkan peruntukan untuk pembangunan luar bandar mereka bercakap tentang melipatgandakan projek mewah di dalam bandar untuk apa projek projek itu untuk rakyat terbanyakkah atau untuk komisyen orang tertentu
8071309 suatu keadaan yang amat menjolok dalam masyarakat kita sekarang ialah wujudnya segolongan orang yang hidup mewah berpoya poya di tengah tengah ratap tangis derita rakyat miskin yang tertindas
8071310 dan jika kami hendak membinasakan suatu negeri maka kami perintahkan kepada orang orang yang hidup mewah di negeri itu supaya mentaati allah tetapi mereka melakukan kedurhakaan dalam negeri itu maka sudah sepantasnya berlaku terhadapnya perkataan ketentuan kami kemudian kami hancurkan negeri itu sehancur hancurnya
8071311 kesederhanaan dalam kehidupan apabila umat islam mulai terjerumus dalam kancah kehidupan moncah maka bermulalah zaman kelemahan dan kejatuhan mereka kerana perhatian mereka sudah beralih dari amal dan jihad kepada kemewahan dan kemoncahan

8071554 ci rendiamo conto che la stragrande maggioranza della comunit composto da persone buone che non tollerano il razzismo ma un piccolo gruppo di persone rendono le cose difficili per tutti
8071555 io non arrivo a pensare che lunico indiano buono lindiano morto ma credo che nove volte su ogni 10 sia cos e non dovrebbe essere molto lontano il decimo
8071556 devi guardare la storia di farmington e i quattro angoli dove utah colorado arizona e new mexico si incrociano il legame tra mitologia e stereotipi su di loro e che fino a poco tempo fa sono stati considerati dei selvaggi e possibile che alcuni ragazzi di etnia bianca non possano capire che gli indiani americani siano altri essere umani li credono e pensano di loro che siano di importanza minore ci sono persone che attaccano lindiano e non ritengono di dover aggredire unaltra persona anche se di altra etnia
8071557 lo abbiamo fatto per i suoi tre quarti di sangue indiano
8071558 latteggiamento della comunit che considera gli indiani americani sporchi e maleodoranti e che non dovrebbero girare a piedi per le strade
8071559 la violenza frequente molto frequente difficile arrivare a giusta causa questa violenza perpetrata come un crimine di odio abbiamo incontrato persone che sono state picchiate per strada o prelevate dalla strada e portate nel deserto per poi essere pestate la popolazione non disposta a dire esattamente ci che accaduto
8071560 per quanto riguarda i nostri incerti vicini di casa di pelle scura dusky scimmie non vi alcun dubbio che alcuni rigorosi metodi devono essere perseguiti perch i bianchi possano vivere sicuri e tranquilli
8071561 sono stati torturati sono stati collocati fuochi artificiali nelle loro narici e nei loro ani
8071562 bruciati in punto di morte e per assicurarsi che morissero questi giovani ragazzi torturatori hanno posizionato sopra di essi dei grandi massi delle dimensioni di un pallone per la pallacanestro
8071563 se non ci date quello che vogliamo verremo a fare atti violenti come fecero i neri di los angeles chicago new york e a sud io non arriver vivo alla fine di questo anno ma vi dico una cosa sto venendo a prendere uno di voi
8071564 non credo che gli omicidi siano dovuti a problemi razziali non erano gli studenti ad aver bevuto gli ubriaconi sono i navajos
8071565 da parte delle autorit giudiziarie o di chiunque altro si fatto ben poco per comprendere il fenomeno della violenza razzista in queste comunit
8071566 il primo passo riconoscere la lotta contro la criminalit e lodio dellamerica contro gli indiani come il cancro che una malattia mortale che stato devastante come lantisemitismo in altre parti del mondo

8071571 i believe life is constantly testing us for our level of commitment and lifes greatest rewards are reserved for those who demonstrate a never ending commitment to act until they achieve this level of resolve can move mountains but it must be constant and consistent as simplistic as this may sound it is still the common denominator separating those who live their dreams from those who live in regret
8071572 if you do what youve always done youll get what youve always gotten
8071573 for changes to be of any true value theyve got to be lasting and consistent
8071574 live life fully while youre here experience everything take care of yourself and your friends

8071591 we were surprised at the rate cpo prices have come down prices of palm oil may ease to the rm2 500 level earlier than expected as palm oil appears to be falling with the price of crude oil
8071592 however it appears that the downtrend has started earlier we find that cpo prices would be trading at a low unless crude oil price rallies
8071593 prices cannot remain high at all times and people should not be so afraid if the cpo goes into a downcycle as this is all part of the commodity cycle
8071594 with the speed of cpo prices coming down it would not be surprising if cpo price could eventually trade as low as rm2 000 a tonne this is also taking into consideration that crude oil would be trading lower and an ease in demand for edible oils
8071595 most of the plantation stocks under our coverage are at a sell call save for ioi corporation bhd and ijm plantations bhd
8071596 we favour these stocks as both companies maintain a selling forward policy for its cpo these companies could be better off than plantation firms which are selling palm oil at spot prices
8071597 year to date malaysian palm oil exports to china had risen 19 1 year on year y o y while exports in july grew 50 1 and 68 2 month on month this could be the start of the malaysian palm oil export recovery
8071598 confess your trespasses to one another and pray for one another that you may be healed the effective fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much
8071599 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and it will be opened to you for everyone who asks receives and he who seeks finds and to him who knocks it will be opened or what man is there among you who if his son asks for bread will give him a stone or if he asks for a fish will he give him a serpent if you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him
8071600 seeing then that we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our confession for we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses but was in all points tempted as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need

8071617 that is why i have been stressing on the role of the different players in the bond market

8071621 the plunge in fcpo palm oil futures prices is directly linked to falling soyabean prices
8071622 the oil palm trees in indonesia and malaysia are producing more than usual and the increasing supply is building up stock levels
8071623 a stronger us dollar didnt just hammer crude oil it also pounded all other commodities lately crude oil has fallen by 23 per cent but palm oil plunged 43 per cent
8071624 soyabean prices are expected to slide further since palm oil moves in lockstep with soyabean you can expect the same
8071625 the sudden plunge in fcpo is very much contributed by short selling since the run up in the prices there is not much room for speculators to make money so they bet on falling prices and the shorting triggered a stampede among all of us to short cover
8071626 woman what do i have to do with you my hour has not yet come
8071627 i dont have any information that would suggest that our military commanders in afghanistan dont believe still that this was a legitimate strike on a taliban target
8071628 strongly deplore the fact that this is not the first incident of this kind
8071629 that killing and maiming of civilians is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law and human rights law
8071630 we do not want international forces to leave afghanistan until the time our security institutions are able to defend afghanistan independently
8071631 within the framework of afghan law with respect to international law
8071632 found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men

8071647 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8071648 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8071649 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8071650 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8071651 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8071652 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play

8071691 google invests heavily in technical facilities around the world and is constantly on the look out for additional locations
8071692 however for competitive reasons we cant confirm or deny possible locations
8071693 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8071694 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8071695 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8071696 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8071697 while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8071698 we have invested a great deal of human and financial capital to ensure we fully operate and comply with federal mandates
8071699 the coupling of our security and hosting skills with the application and infrastructure management capabilities apptis offers provides the government with an extremely compelling cloud computing delivery platform

8071702 abry is one of the most experienced private equity firms in the media communications and information industry
8071703 we believe they are the right partner to continue our aggressive growth plans while providing outstanding service to our valued customers we are very proud of what the q9 team has achieved to date and we look forward to leading them through our next phase of growth

8071710 mr white may wish to consider bringing these matters to the attention of his lawyer so that the issues can be raised in his appeal or in a collateral proceeding
8071711 it appears from your letter that mr white is represented by a deputy public defender eduardo r cruz lopez the proper forum for mr white to address these concerns is therefore through his attorney either by appeal or through a post conviction motion
8071712 i have signed decrees on the recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia by the russian federation that wasnot an easy choice to make but it is the sole chance of saving peoples lives
8071713 this is an historic day for our people im grateful to the russian leadership and to the russian people for this great step which was taken today to recognize abkhazias independence
8071714 russia has saved us from genocide and has granted us the opportunity to develop and live on our own land
8071715 the presidents decision is a response to those political structures that said that russia needs new land that russia is an occupier that russia is going to annex abkhazia and south ossetia

8071722 no honey daddys not sleeping he damn well better not be i would mutter to myself hes on his bike
8071723 the civil rights and voting rights acts were the bridge that brought minorities over into the opportunity to advance in education in politics in society
8071724 lyndon johnsons experience of being born in the south made him aware and sensitive to the history of discrimination the civil rights act and the war on poverty are why i am where i am today
8071725 it made a phenomenal difference in getting america to where we are today
8071726 this campaign isnt about race but its about inclusion of all americans
8071727 unlike many people who are here to lobby the politicians were here to educate the media that are here to cover them
8071728 when i talk about branding its not printing up coffee mugs its selling ideas and bringing people to discuss the ideas
8071729 our role is to help them make sure their voices are heard
8071730 obviously were trying to hype the profile of our organization
8071731 were also trying to brand ourselves with the obama campaign with national politicians with local politicians and workers throughout the country
8071732 we want to show that not all military veterans are for john mccain
8071733 remember when you were in grade school and you read the book the scarlet letter
8071734 the main character hester prynne had to wear a big letter a
8071735 so we thought wed have a little fun with that given the current environment for lobbyists this l is a scarlet letter for lobbyists
8071736 we are leading a very public life people know who we work for how much we get paid and who we give money to
8071737 bring together all the lore art science practice and experience of building scalable websites
8071738 thoughts on cloud computing infrastructure at scale and data centers
8071739 track changes in corporate data centers as they become greener more efficient and more indispensable
8071740 we argue that appropriately architected and interconnected commodity switches may deliver more performance at less cost than available from todays higher end solutions
8071741 we are definitely trying to focus on issues that affect the african american community
8071742 we understand that if hes elected hes not going to be president of black america its a delicate balancing act we have to serve our readers but we also want to be a one stop shop for issues pertaining to all americans
8071743 its important for me that as an african american community we dont follow this trend of thinking that we only have to listen to what comes out of the democratic national committee
8071744 i got my butt beat by the hip hop community for that
8071745 im just trying to make sure that the candidates are held accountable mr obama included
8071746 obama does not get my vote nor should he get anybodys vote who is black just because he is an african american i think we make a mockery of democracy when we dont hold people accountable
8071747 we still need to make sure we have a level of integrity and are true to the purpose the network was created for
8071748 most of my readers are democratic party faithful so yeah it wouldnt be cool with them at all
8071749 one thing were not afraid to do is criticize the party and i do it all the time
8071750 i might get a little look here or there just because of something ive written or talked about
8071751 keystone politics the blog for which he writes has always aimed to be an independent journalism outlet what we really want to do is get the public interested in politics and policy making
8071752 calling everybody in regard to a rebellious population taliban is not very helpful
8071753 i think one of the biggest mistakes weve made strategically after 9 11 was to fail to finish the job here focus our attention here we got distracted by iraq for at least a year now i have called for two additional brigades perhaps three but military alone is not going to be enough
8071754 this year that particular point is more important that it might be in some years
8071755 hard to sit through a convention as a delegate supporting the other candidate i may say something about clinton if its important to the clinton delegates but i doubt well discuss potatoes at any length
8071756 we talked about the tsongas economic plan and governor clinton being a man as solid as new hampshire granite and as warm as new hampshire is cold
8071757 one of the biggest issues for us is voting rights
8071758 we pay more taxes than nine other states we send our sons and daughters off to war what better opportunity to send the message than here
8071759 you cant order people to vote other than how they want to
8071760 if systems were going to break down this is when they would start to show
8071761 i keep replaying it in my mind to see if its working out the way i thought it would
8071762 around this time the buzz just changes you can feel it
8071763 he sets a torrid pace for our other five sons

8071766 delegates america friends everywhere im proud to announce that barack obama is the democratic nominee of the united states of america
8071767 to me to see barack obamas name placed in nomination is just an extraordinary achievement for our nation for our party in just 45 years it speaks to how forward thinking our party is
8071768 my first campaign experience was going to a rally for adlai stevenson when i was 13 years old in white plains n y
8071769 to make sure that harry truman was going to be our president

8072073 the three fans equipping it perform well they could have been spinning a bit faster but noise would have increased they are incredibly quiet at their speed and they still beat a faster fan setup like in the thermaltake xaser vi vh9000bws but there is also a small problem having a third fan on the side this one leaves little room for larger heatsinks such as my xigmatek hdt s1283 cpu cooler i have to force a bit to get the panel closed therefore pushing on the motherboard however if you plan on watercooling you wont have any problems the guardian 921 even allows you to pass tubing to an external radiator by two holes at the back especially made for that purpose moreover a great feature which adds to both watercooling and air cooling setups is the temperature reader with three probes you can stay aware of any temperatures simply by looking at the lcd in front of the case

8072245 one year i really ran into a lot of bad luck where i got the worst calls possible
8072246 honestly i couldnt even hit a shot because i was so nervous they would call every ball out
8072247 that really wasnt my fault i probably would have won that year and i was gonna win that year unfortunately it didnt work out
8072248 i cant sit here and say someone is going to dominate when im still playing tennis

8072276 an attacker in the same area can redirect your packets through their own computer and have their way with them
8072277 banks and other high security sites really should use a ca signed certificate theyre resistant to more classes of attacks and different classes than perspectives is
8072278 however certificate authorities face an interesting problem the system is only as good as the most insecure certificate authority trusted by your browser
8072279 all of the browser manufacturers have been making good strides forward in terms of the security of their browsers but the overall browser security situation is still a mess
8072280 i think that while were moving out of the stone age of browser security were still only in the bronze age

8072284 i ask all of you who worked so hard for me who knocked on doors and made those phone calls who got in arguments from time to time to work as hard for barack obama as you did for me
8072285 lets work our hearts out to elect barack obama and joe biden our next president and vice president
8072286 she will thank her supporters and lay out the case for why they need to support barack obama
8072287 we at lockheed martin are very pleased at how the ship performed during acceptance trials
8072288 acceptance trials are run and coordinated by the navy were not going to get ahead of our navy customer

8072292 its hard to be optimistic we havent had much contact with him it appears hes not interested he hasnt asked many questions about the organization
8072293 we havent spoken to sundins camp for at least a week
8072294 were going to wait for his decision until september if we have to on paper we have the perfect team for him theres certainly room for him with our team
8072295 i know that certain other teams are presently over the salary cap well have to see if mats doesnt join us maybe well discuss things with those teams
8072296 the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to barack obamas ability to show respect to the views of people who may disagree with him
8072297 i dont know its to soon to think about it
8072298 here you cant go five or 10 games without a point without anyone noticing and there you can go under the radar a little bit
8072299 thats one thing that i think is going to benefit not just myself but this team i think you are under the gun here and under the pressure of having to perform
8072300 this will end this will end dear god please let this end if i just close my eyes it will end sooner this will end
8072301 all we had been seeing in the media were images of helpless victims or of looters
8072302 those were the two archetypes kimberly and scott were neither they were survivors and they were putting everything they had into protecting themselves and their community
8072303 they asked her to stay because of the current political uncertainty
8072304 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8072305 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8072306 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in the space of a few weeks
8072307 i think the fact that it seems to be taking several weeks just to have a phone call with opposition leaders i think indicates frankly a much deeper issue and that is that this parliament is increasingly reaching an impasse on a range of issues
8072308 today is an additional episode of a continuing saga of a fabricated emergency by the prime minister
8072309 he wants to meet me and to pretend that the meeting went so badly that he needs to call an election thats what its all about
8072310 now hes saying i want to meet the leaders of the opposition i want them to accept my agenda what is his agenda nobody has any idea of what is his agenda maybe not himself and you want me to agree with it on the phone this is a joke

8072366 i ask all of you who worked so hard for me who knocked on doors and made those phone calls who got in arguments from time to time to work as hard for barack obama as you did for me
8072367 at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right and the status quo just wont cut it
8072368 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8072369 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans and democrats but first and foremost as americans
8072370 she will thank her supporters and lay out the case for why they need to support
8072371 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plan is the billions of dollars hes promising in tax cuts for oil companies and the only thing hell recycle is the same failed bush approach to energy policy
8072372 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home well in john mccains version theres no place like home and home and home and home
8072373 there is no doubt that mistakes have been made in this war and i have certainly voiced my criticisms
8072374 i have great confidence in the president and his team i think hes surrounded by people like don rumsfeld who i know very well and couldnt have a finer secretary of defense than don rumsfeld
8072375 iraq also has seen tremendous improvement in new public services infrastructure free press economic activity and legal institutions that are critical to the long term success of this democracy despite the evident progress some want to cut and run claiming that our troops have done all they can do
8072376 does this sound like a record that deserves criticism and skepticism
8072377 now its time for the iraqis to fund their own reconstruction costs
8072378 has spent only a minute fraction of that surplus on reconstruction costs which are now largely borne by the united states
8072379 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank

8072386 republican legislators respected sen obama his negotiation skills and an ability to understand both sides would serve the country well
8072387 sen obama even on a topic more suited for liberals worked extremely well with conservatives
8072388 i failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self interested partisan posturing appear more noble

8072398 everybody thought my god you are going to write with this guy how is that ever going to work but this guy came in and is really multitalented in all genres
8072399 i was surprised that this guy could sit down and play better than they do and it blew my mind and then he loves southern rock the blues and country it really blew us away

8072408 theyre going all of these routes through threats intimation to try to thwart the first amendment here because they dont have an argument on merit
8072409 people have the right to know if offenders are unlawfully at large whether they are potentially dangerous or not
8072410 were going to let media know right after the police are notified
8072411 everybody did their job according to proper procedural policy direction and guidelines at both my ministry and within the rcmp
8072412 im angry that they escaped and that they didnt let the public know
8072413 they tell me be careful to watch im going on with my life going for coffee meeting with my friends
8072414 they were definitely responding to a situation that was far from normal
8072415 they were certainly keeping the publics interest in mind as they worked and scoured the countryside during the night we also had the police service dog with them and they scoured the entire countryside in doing what they could to find these people
8072416 were getting various types of information and certainly sightings it would be safe to say that were getting information like that
8072417 young thugs inside the dangerous world of canadian street gangs
8072418 if they are members of indian posse and they were trying to intimidate witnesses in any upcoming trials they could have done that while inside prison through their existing network of gang members on the outside
8072419 i think they would have known where they were going before they left

8072422 salvo que alguien incumpla su palabra que no va a ser as no habr ning n movimiento en la plantilla del sevilla
8072423 a m me encanta esa ambici n pero el objetivo de la entidad es quedar entre los cuatro primeros no quiero ninguna presi n sobre mis jugadores porque madrid y barcelona con 400 millones de euros de presupuesto son quienes est n obligados a ello
8072424 es una de las m s importante de la historia de la entidad
8072425 we came out so strong in the first five minutes the way coach statham wanted us to
8072426 the goal was a good lift and a great play from my teammates its a good start and were looking forward to the rest of the season
8072427 with dana scoring after 90 seconds obviously we couldnt have asked for a better start
8072428 then we gave up two sloppy goals and didnt play particularly well for the rest of the half i thought the response of the team to our halftime talk was way beyond what i expected we attacked relentlessly and showed the character of the team and mackenzies goal was a reward for their hard work i was very pleased with the second half performance

8072435 were going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it
8072436 warner brothers is amazing its like they have been walking around with the winning lottery ticket stuck to the bottom of their guccis for over thirty years they scraped it off and discovered dc comics now they are going to put their winning lotto ticket in their pocket and throw their jeans in the wash and warp it to the point you cant recognize it from any other balled up piece of soggy paper
8072437 yeah it seems theyve completely missed the boat on this one the dark knight wasnt a big hit because of its brooding tone it was a hit because it was a well acted well written well directed film that stayed close to the tone of the source material
8072438 warners is equating dark characters with fully realized characters not the same thing at all
8072439 warners are about the make the same mistake the comics industry made back in the 80s after dark knight returns and watchmen this could be comedy gold
8072440 yes dark knight is a record breaking money maker but it seems that warner guy attributes that to its dark brooding tone rather than any number of other factors at least some of which would be difficult to impossible to replicate in another movie

8072471 she is eventually diagnosed with m e a cruel illness that she must learn to live with over the next decade all of her relationships are tested and changed by her condition but helen s story is so much more than an account of her suffering far from it the state of me explores the loneliness and chaos of one of the most misunderstood illnesses of our time but also celebrates the importance of family friendships and sexual love

8072476 the indian ocean hosts some of the most diverse reefs in the world
8072477 current marine protected areas dont show any potential for faster recovery than non protected areas
8072478 the west indian ocean lost about half of its coral and some areas lost up to 90 percent
8072479 we need to focus on areas that are recovering faster or escaping the impacts of climate change
8072480 this is where your brood stocks of coral areas are that will help seed other areas

8072489 i consider this proposal to be of national significance it is relevant to new zealands obligations to the global environment in terms of the kyoto protocol
8072490 in addition the proposal will have direct physical effects on more than one region in this case the franklin and waikato districts and the waikato region in terms of security of electricity supply the proposal will have potential effects beyond these areas
8072491 every dhb would have formal controls over the management of controlled drugs such as opiates
8072492 i personally think dhbs have an obligation to support staff with addiction problems or dependence on chemicals
8072493 but of course if its a security issue and drugs are going missing and being sold for example then thats an entirely different disciplinary matter
8072494 to me if the drug was contained in an ampoule it would be difficult to dilute it and replace it at that point perhaps its when the drug is being used with the patient and transferred from the ampoule or vial over to an iv system it may be easier to dilute it at that point
8072495 i think dhbs in particular i think they should look at the potential for staff to use drugs for their own use if they have a potential problem and maybe refer them to their occupational health unit or the doctors health advisory service accordingly
8072496 no the kids have been controlling the remote but ive been catching up on it from blogs
8072497 arguably misplaced investment judgment where prospects of recovery are more remote and where cost exceeds market value
8072498 that is supported by substantial undrawn credit lines so gpg is well placed for selective buying opportunities
8072499 there is also a deferred tax adjustment of 22 million which is purely international financial reporting standards nonsense and can be safely disregarded as a legitimate inclusion in any proper analysis of the result
8072500 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8072501 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle

8072505 they began to push us back with their batons and their riot gear and all of a sudden everyone noticed that they were coughing you couldnt smell it you couldnt see it my eyes were running someone literally had to drag me back to in front of the hotel and then we couldnt get in
8072506 the hotel was on lock down the elevators were locked they were telling people that you couldnt leave the shuttle bus over the pepsi center was cancelled
8072507 what was frightening to me if they were supposed to be there to protect i want to know who they were protecting
8072508 this is not my first democrat national convention ive never seen this type of law enforcement presence this is i would say a little intrusive
8072509 i think the force was necessary cause it sends a message to the other protesters theyre just trying to keep the city safe i lived in la during the rodney king riots i just dont want to see that again
8072510 i dont talk about it ive talked to the senator about it and its all personal
8072511 for forty years i loathed the generation and said they are a people who go astray in their heart and they have not known my ways therefore i swore in my wrath they shall not enter my rest
8072512 let us therefore strive to enter that rest so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience
8072513 you represent many different ethnicities and races and religions but you all have one thing in common and that is a shared love of freedom this love of liberty is what binds our nation together and this is the love that makes us all americans

8072517 we have to accept more and more that platform holders themselves cannot have exclusives unless theyre given millions and millions of dollars not to develop a particular game for one particular platform
8072518 but for developers and you could take someone like quantic dream for example a great game it takes a lot of time to develop they need a little bit of funding external development in exchange its exclusive that works so exclusivity possibly with developers is more likely that exclusivity with publishers

8072525 the results of this study represent a potentially new therapeutic approach that of control of a biochemical cause of hypertension rather than nonspecifically lowering elevated blood pressure although not representing a fully developed strategy this study raises an alternative strategy that may prove to be more effective than currently available options
8072526 i believe that people like myself should keep their mouth shut on politics
8072527 thats not just cancer related to melanoma or other skin cancers
8072528 for prostate cancer the trend was in the direction of increased risk but the association was weaker and not statistically significant
8072529 people who have suboptimal ability to repair dna damage that the sun can cause are far more likely to get nonmelanoma skin cancer we are hypothesizing that that might also be the link to why there is a greater increased cancer risk in general
8072530 it is not unreasonable to suppose that patients with nonmelanoma skin cancers especially if diagnosed when the patient is young puts that person in a higher risk category of systemic cancers
8072531 in addition these patients are followed closely for further skin cancers and therefore may have an increased diagnosis of other cancers because they are plugged into the medical system
8072532 our skin cancer patients should know that they may be at increased for a wide variety of cancers like breast lung and colon and should not ignore early signs and symptoms if they occur
8072533 people who have had skin cancers should make sure they are up to date on all their screening tests
8072534 they should be up to date on their colonoscopies fecal occult blood and mammograms and pap smears

8072554 for the time being the ps2 doesnt seem to be left in the lurch and seems destined to actually live up to the much vaunted 10 year life cycle that sony keeps talking about
8072555 some developers like atlus and sega are still supporting the system with new exclusive games like persona 4 and yakuza 2 respectively with no shortage of guitar heroes or maddens the systems library isnt nearly as bleak as one would assume for a console entering the full decade stretch
8072556 id have to agree with david trahair on this one while investing early as dave indicates will provide a sizeable retirement income and the financial discipline will aide you in many avenues of life planning your retirement lifestyle when you have yet to reach 30 is a little premature life can toss so very many twists in the road
8072557 im not going to vote for mccain but i might not vote for obama either
8072558 i was such a proud supporter of hillary and chair of her campaign but right now im so fired up to elect barack obama
8072559 its more disappointment than anything and theyll get over it
8072560 i dont think any of them is crazy enough to think theyre better off with mccain
8072561 if obama had lost and by such a small margin no one would call his supporters whiners its so pejorative
8072562 i hope it doesnt do any damage because we certainly dont need that
8072563 its a historic part of my life that a woman got so far
8072564 obviously im well aware that i wasnt the most popular pickup in calgary flames history
8072565 but at the same time i think youve got to give it a little time and give me a chance if given the chance i think i can perform and help this team out
8072566 the big thing was full support from the ownership group on down
8072567 its a four and a half year old story that started up again because theres nothing else to talk about hes done everything the league wanted him to do hes apologized publicly apologized privately all those things so weve moved on everybodys moved on other than whats left
8072568 if it had been fresh and new it might have been but its not
8072569 todd wanted to play in canada and he wanted to play on a good team he chose to come here he could have easily done it the other way he picked good team good city knowing full well he was going to face the questions i give him full marks for that
8072570 i cant lie to you its not the jersey i always thought i would wear especially coming in here as many times as i did with vancouver
8072571 but at the same time ive played enough games in here to know what kind of fan base it is and what kind of team they are
8072572 youre under the gun and under the pressure of having to perform im looking forward to having that kind of pressure
8072573 at this point in the investigation known associates locations where the escapees frequented sic and family members are being contacted in an attempt to determine the whereabouts of the escaped inmates
8072574 these are some serious offenders so people are interested in getting them put back in jail
8072575 after two and a half years of minority government thats probably the inevitable result so thats the reality of the situation
8072576 its prudent for the governor general to remain in canada
8072577 nobody has any idea what is his agenda maybe not even himself
8072578 the other party has tabled an economic agenda that remains diametrically opposed to everything this government stands for
8072579 i think you really have increasingly in parliament two visions of where we should be leading the country particularly during challenging economic times and thats something im going to have to reflect on
8072580 this prime minister is panicking inventing reasons to trigger an election
8072581 theres a number of things were going to have to look at it in terms of timing well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in the space of a few weeks
8072582 these times are challenging and we can reasonably expect them to remain challenging for the near future
8072583 bmo was quite a disappointment it was quite a bit lower than the targets
8072584 the news here is that lowered expectations should be thought of as the norm
8072585 scotia did better than bmo and thats part and parcel of the fact that they have very limited u s operations
8072586 there are challenging results out of the u s and i think the market rewards scotia for not playing in that pool
8072587 the other banks will have higher provisions for credit losses too but i think this is very specific to bmo because its fairway thats causing the problem here
8072588 people are really going to be watching whats happening on the domestic side
8072589 not only does the arts and cultural industry make a valuable economic contribution in its own right it also stimulates creative activity in other sectors of the economy

8072591 israeli forces have killed more than 4 000 palestinians half of them children

8072594 land water and air are under constant sight of a sophisticated military surveillance system that makes gaza like the truman show
8072595 in this film every gazan actor has a predefined role and the israeli army behaves as a director the gaza strip needs to be shown as what it is an israeli laboratory backed by the international community where human beings are used as rabbits to test the most dramatic and perverse practices of economic suffocation and starvation
8072596 thousands of wounded disabled and shell shocked people unable to receive any treatment the shadows of human beings roam the ruins they only know the israeli army will return and they know what this will mean for them more imprisonment in their homes for weeks more death and destruction in monstrous proportions
8072597 two thirds of the 621 children killed at checkpoints in the street on the way to school in their homes died from small arms fire directed in over half of cases to the head neck and chest the snipers wound
8072598 is that 99 4 per cent of the children we studied suffer trauma once you look at the rates of exposure to trauma you see why 99 2 per cent of the study groups homes were bombarded 97 5 per cent were exposed to tear gas 96 6 per cent witnessed shootings 95 8 per cent witnessed bombardment and funerals almost a quarter saw family members injured or killed
8072599 because israeli soldiers are the strongest and have apache gunships
8072600 stripping the context of palestinian violence the response of a desperate and horribly oppressed people and the terrible suffering from which it arises
8072601 refuses to recognise israel and wants to fight not talk
8072602 historically we believe all palestine belongs to palestinians but were talking now about reality about political solutions if israel reached a stage where it was able to talk to hamas i dont think there would be a problem of negotiating with the israelis for a solution
8072603 i do solemnly swear or affirm that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states so help me god
8072604 these limitations are due to the fact that public law gives to such coinage a value which does not attach as a mere consequence of intrinsic value their quality as a legal tender is an attribute of law aside from their bullion value they bear therefore the impress of sovereign power which fixes value and authorizes their use in exchange
8072605 a coin dollar is worth no more for the purposes of tender in payment of an ordinary debt than a note dollar
8072606 one of the things that we sensed was that students were not as engaged at the university as students were at other universities
8072607 we wanted to have some sort of intensive program that would really connect them to the university connect them with each other and connect them with the faculty and staff
8072608 contrary to what i hear a lot of institutions are doing
8072609 the movement generally across the country has been to reduce the amount of time between when students are allowed to move in and when classes actually start what weve found is that the more time you give the students the more time they have to see minneapolis in ways you might not want them to see minneapolis
8072610 we really thought about how we can get the students on campus give them the content they need and help them make the connections without it being a drinking fest
8072611 dorms food service transportation this all has to be paid for
8072612 its related to graduation because its going to connect students much earlier on with the array of opportunities they can have culturally socially or academically at the university that engagement and as quick as you can do it is really key to success in college today
8072613 research shows that the more the student is involved and engaged in student activities in leadership positions the better theyll do in their academic work and the sooner theyll graduate
8072614 thats not always self evident but we want to introduce them to these opportunities so maybe theyll realize gee maybe i should balance some of these outside the classroom opportunities

8072652 if it were to come out that in fact owens glenn account is the accurate account that is winston peters approached owen glenn for the money when you add that with the fact winston denied it very very publicly i think he cant stay as foreign minister at that point
8072653 these are incredibly important issues for our democracy the public have got a right to be reassured about the influence of money over politics and so i am hopeful the privileges committee can get to the bottom of it
8072654 its very clear now that winston peters has misled the public of new zealand
8072655 winstons in a spot now where the whole world is wrong and only winston is right im afraid its winston peters credibility that has been shot to bits

8072665 socrates i have often envied you reciters that art of yours ion you have always to wear fine clothes and to look as beautiful as you can is a part of your art then again you are obliged to be continually in the company of many good poets and especially of homer who is the best and most divine of them and to understand him and not merely learn his words by rote is a thing greatly to be envied and no man can be a reciter who does not understand the meaning of the poet for the reciter ought to interpret the mind of the poet to his hearers but how can he interpret him well unless he knows what he means all this is greatly to be envied ion very true socrates interpretation has certainly been the most laborious part of my art and i believe myself able to speak about homer better than any man and that neither metrodorus of lampsacus nor stesimbrotus of thasos nor glaucon nor any one else who ever was had as good ideas about homer as i have or as many
8072666 socrates then my dear friend can i be mistaken in saying that ion is equally skilled in homer and in other poets since he himself acknowledges that the same person will be a good judge of all those who speak of the same things and that almost all poets do speak of the same things
8072667 ion why then socrates do i lose attention and go to sleep and have absolutely no ideas of the least value when any one speaks of any other poet but when homer is mentioned i wake up at once and am all attention and have plenty to say
8072668 socrates the reason my friend is obvious no one can fail to see that you speak of homer without any art or knowledge if you were able to speak of him by rules of art you would have been able to speak of all other poets for poetry is a whole

8072670 the first iraq war is obviously an event that impinges directly on the current situation and yet at the same time it seems curiously remote its post cold war pre 9 11 context is in some ways blurrier than more distant times the war itself happened fast and left a confused legacy

8072672 at this priam although even now fast in toils of death yet withheld not nor spared a wrathful cry ah for thy crime for this thy hardihood may the gods if there is goodness in heaven to care for aught such pay thee in full thy worthy meed and return thee the reward that is due who hast made me look face to face on my childs murder and polluted a fathers countenance with death ah not such to a foe was the achilles whose parentage thou beliest but he revered a supplicants right and trust restored to the tomb hectors blood drained corpse and sent me back to my own realm
8072673 the man fires a rifle for many years and he goes to war and afterward he turns his rifle in at the armory and believes hes finished with the rifle but no matter what else he might do with his hands love a woman build a house change his sons diaper his hands remember the rifle and the power the rifle proffered the cold weight the buttstock in the shoulder the sexy slope and fall of the trigger guard to be a marine a true marine you must kill with all of your training all of your expertise if you dont kill youre not a combatant even if youve been fired at and so you are not yet a marine receiving fire is easy youve either made a mistake or the enemy is better and now you are either lucky or dead but not a combatant the sad truth is that when youre a jarhead youre incapable of not being a jarhead you are a symbol so that in a city like san diego where there are more jarheads than windows and the jarheads are embarrassing because of their behavior and dress and you want more than anything else not to be associated with the eagle globe and anchor you are still one though you might be an individual first you are a symbol or part of a larger symbol that some people believe stands for liberty and honor and valor god and country and corps sometimes this is correct sometimes this is foolish but either way you are part of the goddamn thing that jarhead with the high and tight haircut the disneyland t shirt acid washed jeans farmers tan poor grammar and plan stupid look on his face he is you and that one with the silly regulation mustachio the overweight wife from his hometown of bumfuck with three kids in tow three kids covered with sticky boardwalk foods and wet sand one of them crying because he has to pee and the older sister just punched him in the face he is you and that jarhead is you the one with the wife just twenty four hours out of a bar in the pi the both of them deeply in love with each other and all things american he is you and the jarheads fighting and warring and cussing and killing in every filthy corner of the godforsaken globe from 1775 until now they are you this is troubling and difficult to admit and it causes you unending anguish and you attempt to deny it but its true even now

8072681 if you can learn writing practice well it is a good foundation for all other writing
8072682 either in new mexico or ohio we are under a big sky that big sky is wild mind im going to climb up to that sky straight over our heads and put one dot on it with a magic marker see that dot that dot is what zen calls monkey mind or what western psychology calls part of conscious mind we give all our attention to that one dot so when it says we cant write that were no good are failures fools for even picking up a pen we listen to it
8072683 go ahead kiss a tree walk right out your front door put your arms around one that you pass every day at the curb pucker up your lips and give it a big smacker close your eyes and put a chocolate kiss in your mouth or a strawberry or an almond for those of healthful persuasion feel it on your tongue and dream now write write anything you want kissing a tree is silly what isnt silly writing is the silliest of all if you can write out of that silliness youll be a long way on the path

8072715 por consumer entiendo el mero consumidor el que disfruta el servicio sin ning n otro tipo de matiz se ha de entender que es una tipolog a como ya se ha dicho que dif cilmente se va a encontrar en la realidad de la industria tur stica por lo que debemos mirarlo desde un poco de perspectiva en este sentido el consumer es el turista cl sico el que vive todav a en un entorno tur stico 1 0 donde la informaci n que consume est controlada directamente por los agentes tur sticos no viaja por internet ni prepara sus viajes personalmente sino que deja que los mismos sean organizados por agentes de viajes tour operadores y otros intermediarios el boca oreja es local circunscrito al c rculo m s cercano por lo que su efecto es limitado suele consumir paquetes tur sticos y viajes organizados de modo que el tipo de experiencias disfrutadas se pueden calificar de est ndar es un turista que suele diversificar poco en sus viajes por lo que la repetici n y la fidelidad a un destino suele ser alta el prosumer es el productor consumidor el cliente que crea el producto que va a consumir volvemos otra vez a la necesidad de perspectiva ya que si focalizamos el estudio en el destino todos los turistas son prosumers por lo que debemos alejarnos para visualizar al turista desde el nacimiento de la necesidad desde aqu vemos que el prosumer es un consumidor activo que se informa que navega e investiga ya no se f a s lo del consejo de los agentes tur sticos sino que visita p ginas en internet que le puedan ser tiles blogs redes sociales p ginas de opini n para l los dem s turistas son una fuente de informaci n tanto o m s autorizada que los agentes del sector crea su propio producto tratando de evitar paquetes y experiencias est ndar suele variar mucho en los destinos que visita por lo que su grado de fidelidad es limitado sin embargo en este punto ser a interesante hacer una matizaci n puesto que estamos hablando del cambio de entorno y de un reposicionamiento de los actores parece que es el momento de hablar de un cambio de enfoque de la fidelidad ya no podemos hablar de la fidelidad como la mera fidelidad directa es decir la repetici n de compra del mismo turista sino que debemos incluir la fidelidad diferida la predisposici n del viajero a la repetici n de compra pero que no le lleva a l mismo a comprar sino a fomentar publicitar esa compra en otros para el prosumer la fidelidad diferida es importante aunque su efecto limitado ya que vive en el entorno 2 0 pero de un modo incompleto pues no es creador de contenidos sino que se limita a recopilar informaci n creada por otros por ello su boca oreja es como en el consumer de un mbito muy limitado por ltimo el adprosumer es el prosumer activo el viajero que crea su propio producto y luego publicita la experiencia como el prosumer vive en un entorno 2 0 pero ahora en su totalidad la informaci n en este caso es bidireccional de modo que adem s de consultar las opiniones de otros es prescriptor al publicitar las suyas suele tambi n alejarse de paquetes y experiencias est ndar buscando la variedad no es fiel al estilo cl sico pero s aplica la fidelidad diferida en este caso con un fuerte impacto ya que su car cter activo hace que sus opiniones sean escuchadas en la red de modo que el boca oreja word of mouth es masivo como prescriptor puede ser positivo o negativo ya que sus opiniones pueden ir en los dos sentidos participa en blogs redes sociales comunidades multiplicando su poder de influencia

8072721 el ecoturista no viene a realizar precisamente ecoturismo sino que hace un poco de ecoturismo se va haciendo ecoturista durante su estad a esta es la realidad por ello existe una contradicci n debido a nuestra costumbre de ofertar pasivamente como la casera en el mercado nuestros productos cuando existiendo realmente la necesidad de encadenar eslabones una cadena productiva se busca comprender como viene el turista a adquirir nuestro producto servicio mediante agencias de viaje o tour operadores internet etc

8072738 how we fare during the regular season will depend very much on how half a dozen of our young players progress
8072739 were not going to be able to start finding that out until we drop the puck for real
8072740 the key word for the maple leafs management and coaching is going to be patience

8072752 youre under the gun and under the pressure of having to perform im looking forward to having that kind of pressure

8072915 amava molto il suo lavoro alle sette di sera prima del turno lucidava la sua divisa e la sua pistola pronto a partire la securpol e tanta gente comune ci hanno aiutato una solidariet commovente ma le istituzioni ci hanno dimenticato
8072916 di sostegno da tanta gente comune che non conoscevo dice la signora baldanzi il mondo dellassociazionismo e anche i clienti della securpol come supermercati e banche ci sono stati vicino un supporto davvero commovente
8072917 il fatto che mio figlio possa vedere che al mondo non c solo gente cattiva una solidariet che dimostra quanto mio marito fosse benvoluto da tutti il giorno dopo la rapina lo abbiamo passato nella caserma dei carabinieri di massa marittima persone splendide che ci hanno fatto sentire a casa spiegandoci il corso delle indagini
8072918 il suo comportamento in questa vicenda da ammirare parla spesso di suo padre ne parla con me si informa e guarda la televisione seguendo le indagini commentando le notizie conosce la situazione e conosceva la pericolosit del lavoro di suo padre
8072919 penso che la morte di mio marito sia stata uningiustizia per la vigliaccheria con cui stato ucciso seguo molto le indagini perch ho voglia di sapere sapere chi ha fatto la rapina credo nelle forze dellordine per ci che stanno facendo la voglia quella di poter dire al pi presto che chi ha ucciso mio marito stato preso chi ha fatto questo non ha scuse sapeva di essere armato
8072920 e tutto molto triste quando si riceve una telefonata come quella che ho ricevuto io come se si venisse catapultati in un altro mondo fino a un attimo prima eravamo una famiglia seguivamo nostro figlio nella sua crescita progettavamo il suo futuro una vita normale di colpo nelle nostre giornate entrano dinamiche e vocaboli che mai avremmo pensato di conoscere la rapina i banditi le armi
8072921 che se questo latitante non ha niente da temere si deve costituire la giustizia far il suo corso se innocente e non ha niente da nascondere deve farsi avanti a questa donna comunque non auguro mai di vivere quello che ho vissuto io

8072935 the most important thing is to educate people then if they still want to be mad at us thats fine
8072936 we want citizens to understand we are all trying to work together to achieve what is fair and equitable
8072937 were united to do what is right and fair they may still be upset by annual appraisals and if they want to try to get that changed in the legislature they can
8072938 we found throughout the appeals process that there was a gap in proper information getting to the property owners
8072939 property owners were not getting clear information at the beginning on when the value they were receiving was set on their property
8072940 most of the time the value on that notice was based on a period more than a year earlier but they think its the value of their property today
8072941 mass appraisal is not a perfect science no doubt about it appraisal is an art and mass appraisal even more so
8072942 just as each of us has one body with many members and these members do not all have the same function so in christ we who are many form one body and each member belongs to all the others
8072943 a lot of the fall is due to the increase in the health insurance from public health insurance
8072944 we wanted a program that would teach our kids in a fun way to conserve and be respectful of nature this area is a breeding ground or nursery for all of the areas marine life everything starts out here and we teach the children to have fun in the water but still be respectful of the creatures that live here
8072945 this is so much fun my husband michael is very interested in marine life and he thought this would be educational but still fun for our son joshua im so glad we came this is fascinating
8072946 the parents often bring their children here thinking it is something just for young people
8072947 they soon find that they are having as much fun collecting shells and looking for baby shrimp as their kids are
8072948 this particular pipefish is green from the algae and grasses present in the water
8072949 this pipefish can now hide easily from predators he is now wearing his own camouflage vest i guess you can say one small fact about the pipefish is that the males produce the babies

8072952 i know that the lessons that al maliki has taken from history are on his mind
8072953 i think maliki understands that no legitimate iraqi prime minister can accept any foreign presence in iraq history makes that perfectly clear
8072954 this agreement will be the test for the current government
8072955 we supported al maliki in what he achieved for iraq until now but none of that will count for him if this agreement does not ensure full independence and sovereignty for iraq
8072956 unless he manages to restore real iraqi sovereignty he wont be able to survive as prime minister
8072957 i cant imagine he wants to be remembered as someone like that

8072964 ah vandon still gullible as ever i see do you remember her shes the one who helped us kill kittalian
8072965 and now she used kittalians personality to get you to follow her ha ha ha ha
8072966 i was hoping youd last a bit longer farewell vandon
8072967 hes a man who has all the knowledge of the world but when he opens his mouth it all tries to come out at once
8072968 here at boffer we love our customers the only complaint we have is we dont have enough of them
8072969 since kidnapping people and forcing them to buy stuff off us is a bit extreme we have decided that you guys will have to help us by manufacturing new customers
8072970 with this in mind we have teamed up with the shenzhen cattle breeding company to launch by way of a freebie thats right at no cost to you a brand new product we bring you the usb fornication optimiser
8072971 helps reduce the time it takes to conceive your baby
8072972 this product was originally produced for cattle but the manufacturer assures us that with their modifications it will now work on humans we can take no responsibility whatsoever if it doesnt
8072973 i thought it was a useful tool for people trying to conceive
8072974 although you can get the same on one of the fertility websites it says it comes with test sticks which are presumably ovulation test sticks which can be expensive so i thought it was a good freebie all be it for a niche market
8072975 i think it very cruel to find amusement in what can be a very difficult emotional physical and mental time for some people
8072976 fox was sending lawyers who were looking at all the commas and the dots
8072977 she doesnt believe her sister intentionally did anything to her child
8072978 she is not physically capable of having committed those acts
8072979 this whole ordeal has taken a very negative effect on her emotionally and physically
8072980 she wants this to be over she wants to be vindicated
8072981 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion
8072982 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8072983 im honored to stand before you as governor bob caseys son and a proud supporter of barack obama
8072984 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8072985 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8072986 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8072987 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8072988 i dont know about you but thats not just right
8072989 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8072990 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8072991 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8072992 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8072993 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8072994 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8072995 there is a very strong possibility that the committee will be unable to complete its investigation before congress expires that may leave important public concerns regarding the nations federal criminal justice system unaddressed
8072996 simply calling an issue important primarily because it involves the relationship of the political branches does not transform the executives weak arguments into a likelihood of success
8072997 i was like whoa he looks a lot quicker he looks faster he looks more sure of himself
8072998 as weve gone through this preseason all those things i saw in the spring im seeing now
8072999 hes just more certain about what his role is and what he should be doing and getting to that spot as quickly as possible
8073000 i think my conditioning is much better and my legs are obviously another year removed from surgery which helps
8073001 im so much more comfortable in the system just a lot of things factor into that i think im playing at a level where i havent been before
8073002 sometimes ben will be in some of our other packages where hell be a rusher were going to try to work both of them in the nickel like we did a year ago
8073003 first databank manipulated prices and mckesson would sell drugs at inflated prices
8073004 this would be a benefit to all counties and the state
8073005 plaintiffs have a persuasive argument that the alleged fraud had a class wide impact

8073007 we u s marshal deputies direct several suspected illegal immigrants from the federal courthouse in hattiesburg miss to a waiting van for transportation to an overnight holding facility rogelio v solis associated press didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8073008 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8073009 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my immigrants rights attorney john foxworth jr of gulfport miss discusses the possible charges many of the suspected illegal immigrants picked up in yesterdays raid in laurel miss might face as he readies for a meeting with other attorneys and immigrant rights activists outside a hattiesburg miss church tuesday aug 26 2008 rogelio v solis associated press husband go and when i will see him
8073010 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8073011 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8073012 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8073013 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8073014 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8073015 obviously were extremely disappointed shes a great kid a great player
8073016 i talked to paul hill a little over two weeks ago he eliminated us from her list
8073017 i felt like she was trying to rush me into the process of committing
8073018 every coach wants to get a commitment but myself and my parents weve told her we were going through the process im going to take my visits and then i was going to make my decision when i felt the time was right
8073019 i think that was obviously a misunderstanding a miscommunication all i want to say is we offered tayler hill when she was in eighth grade and weve been waiting on her however many years this has been

8073035 im not usually very emotional but the final flight got to me
8073036 its sad to know his career with alaska is over and that we wont be able to fly together again
8073037 but that was never the case in the cockpit it was always fun to fly with her there was never any bickering it was always enjoyable it was probably smoother than flying with other pilots
8073038 i dont think i realized at the time just how cool it was but the passengers loved it
8073039 one moment you are flying and the next you are rolling down the runway ive been a captain for 21 years and i normally do that
8073040 warner get a real job no ones going to want a phone in the car
8073041 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
8073042 i can confirm we are in pretty active negotiations and discussions with them i cant confirm that a deal has been crafted yet
8073043 it is but anything is possible we are very optimistic that a deal will be done very soon
8073044 i could not make a call on whether or not we would have the network up on the air on time for that game there are so many engineering logistics that have to be done
8073045 it is an important find because we have found over the years several tombs that have been looted but never one that was intact
8073046 a multiple tomb in which three funeral bundles were found one has an impressive mask with the human characteristics of a woman
8073047 it is a woman because in the surrounding area we found offerings and textile items like those of a female weaver
8073048 improving patient outcomes and reducing cost of care by taking noninvasive monitoring to new sites and applications
8073049 have one shot to get it right and the status quo wont cut it
8073050 i have been involved in sports for a very long time being a sports official
8073051 i used to be in charge of snooker later after the cricket association was established i got to know more and more about cricket and began to like it more and more so i changed from snooker to cricket
8073052 i think that cricket in china is already moving ahead
8073053 they have 140 level one coaches and umpires now theyve achieved that in the period since 2005 that is indeed very noteworthy
8073054 the icc has believed for quite some time that there is a real opportunity for cricket in china and one of our projects is to explore the possibility of cricket becoming very large in this country
8073055 china has such a strategic approach to everything they wont be benchmarking against some atoll in the pacific
8073056 they will be saying what is the world standard and trying to better it seeking prominence and world recognition
8073057 the icc came to us and said they had a very charming game which could be introduced to china and at that time the then vice president and secretary general of the cca paid a visit to hong kong to observe the hong kong international sixes
8073058 we found that cricket is a very good for chinese people because it emphasises hand eye co ordination
8073059 now what we need to do urgently is improve our high performance
8073060 with high performance in the big events such as the asian games we can grab the attention of a mass of the people so it will then be easier to promote cricket they will know it and they will love it
8073061 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8073062 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8073063 none of the six party talks joint statements however commits the us to any deadline for removing north korea from the list
8073064 to see how things play out in the coming weeks
8073065 i can confirm that us personnel remain on the ground at the yongbyon facility monitoring the sites
8073066 at this stage if the north koreans are not prepared to make specific commitments on verification i think the process will bog down probably for the remainder of the bush administration
8073067 i dont think the bush administration will cave in on this
8073068 they were concentrating on the more severe forms of the condition but we felt it was important to get this information out there
8073069 with all other diabetes medications we know there has been pancreatitis and some of those people have died
8073070 weve been doing quite a bit of writing with john 5
8073071 everybody thought my god you are going to write with this guy how is that ever going to work but this guy came in and is really multitalented in all genres
8073072 i was surprised that this guy could sit down and play glen campbell and roy clark better than they do and it blew my mind and then he loves southern rock the blues and country it really blew us away
8073073 keeping this thing rolling and doing what were doing were loving where were at right now
8073074 this thing between us and kid rock kind came around when we experimented with it in detroit the year before last
8073075 then this year we started the tour in madison square garden and it was phenomenal the shows are selling out
8073076 we at lockheed martin are very pleased at how the ship performed during acceptance trials
8073077 acceptance trials are run and coordinated by the navy were not going to get ahead of our navy customer
8073078 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8073079 theres some studies that show that some herbs have a very promising anti diabetic effect anti high blood pressure effect a cholesterol lowering effect
8073080 in ayurveda and all those traditional systems there certainly are some promising wisdom and heritage that we need to harvest but the key thing is we need to separate out whats helpful and what needs to be looked at and perhaps set aside

8073135 its gotten into my bed mattress its gotten into my lungs
8073136 were willing to give to new disasters but have to remember theres old disasters still out there
8073137 this has been the most devastating fire weve seen in recent memory
8073138 many families have suffered terrific loss from this fire our hearts go out to those affected
8073139 it started as a brush fire ran up the bluffs and started going house to house with wood shake roofs
8073140 we had multiple homes on fire when we pulled up but it was mostly the wind the wind was blowing so hard
8073141 the wind is so strong were literally just watching houses go up in flames
8073142 then you realize you dont have any pictures any more you realize im cold and i have no clothes i have nothing left

8073147 its new york drivers its one thing ive observed from living here they will not slow down its almost like youre taunting them i was told in boston that signaling is revealing your intentions to the enemy its the same here youre better off not signaling
8073148 there are people with entire academic careers devoted to off ramps
8073149 that much of our increase in driving stems from trips to the mall
8073150 the way we drive is responsible for a good part of our traffic problems
8073151 where the road and the sky collide america through the eyes of its drivers
8073152 people with the economic means to act on their social and economic interests getting in the way of other people with the means to act on theirs
8073153 the problem is that if everyone tries to do what they think is the best thing for themselves the actual travel time for all drivers goes up
8073154 i dont know what this person is doing using two lanes at once
8073155 ive always had a dislike of suvs and now i have even more of one when it comes to traffic flow harmony and the highway they take longer to go through intersections and because of their size they pose so many dangers to other drivers that begs the question whats the legal liability for near crashes whats the ethical burden of driving at 85 mph to be honest i could care less about what happens to the person choosing to do that but hes putting every other person on the road at a risk how do we charge for that as a society
8073156 young girls are more afraid of becoming fat than they are of cancer nuclear war or losing their parents

8073171 yes the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8073172 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8073173 how many people look at these things and wonder what the future holds for them their children their country how many
8073174 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8073175 after sept 11 if there was a call from the president to get us off foreign oil to stop funding the very terrorists who had just attacked us every american would have said how can i do my part
8073176 john mccain promises more of the same a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq i dont know about you but thats not just right thats four more years that we cant just afford
8073177 warner get a real job no ones going to want a phone in the car
8073178 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
8073179 this is a significant racketeering case involving alleged criminal activity spanning the globe
8073180 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion
8073181 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8073182 any scientist who cant explain to an eight year old what he is doing is a charlatan
8073183 querem desmatar metade da amaz nia assine contra o projeto de lei que amea a as florestas brasileiras em
8073184 theres an obvious place for science communicators too and even for a strategic plan for getting science across into the public debate so long as it isnt trimming and spinning why not we have to fight the pr wars somehow and we wont do it by naively repeating the information as if to fill a gap in public knowledge the public usually do not care and they need for the well being of the common weal to be made to care just as they do for civics mathematics and hygeine
8073185 suppose all sprang from all things any kind might take its origin from any thing no fixed seed required men from the sea might rise and from the land the scaly breed and fowl full fledged come bursting from the sky the horned cattle the herds and all the wild would haunt with varying offspring tilth and waste nor would the same fruits keep their olden trees but each might grow from any stock or limb by chance and change indeed and were there not for each its procreant atoms could things have each its unalterable mother old but since produced from fixed seeds are all each birth goes forth upon the shores of light from its own stuff from its own primal bodies and all from all cannot become because in each resides a secret power its own
8073186 4 the fear factor ideally we want to be honest in our opinion of a paper but we are also human and dont want to suffer the consequences of bruising the ego of a potential reviewer or search committee member staying anonymous is not the solution since that makes it difficult for everybody else to properly evaluate the comment after all it does matter who is doing the criticizing
8073187 5 speed even the liveliest online discussion of a paper will drag on over hours or days if a paper grabs my attention i will discuss at a lab meeting or journal club and over the course of one hour we will have thoroughly dissected it
8073188 my next project is about charles darwin he says in a letter to emma his wife something like i sat down on a bench and saw a bird singing in the trees and saw a wide mass of life going on around me and i thought i didnt care what the process was that brought this into place because its so wonderful if i lost that feeling id go and do something else
8073189 the idiots guide to world domination and the brutal suppression of freedom
8073190 as much as john mccain would like us to believe hes different his economic plan offers not a single new idea just more of the same
8073191 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8073192 the republicans are not going to run this convention and cnn is not going to run this convention
8073193 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8073194 we set out last night to make sure that america knew that michelle obama was going to be the kind of first lady that they could all be proud of and that was a lot like them
8073195 all this stuff about mccain and this hitting back hard enough thats all political blah blah
8073196 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8073197 i think that senator obama has tried to run a campaign of not attacking and of not polarizing the country and it has worked for him so far going down the road i dont know whether he needs to do more attacking and red meat or not but i will say that he has an expert in eating red meat in joe biden so im not worried about it
8073198 even john mccain concedes that we are worse off than we were four years ago
8073199 but you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8073200 its easy to forget someone when five years from now everyone is gone this is our way of saying you might not have known her but this is what she stood for this is what she embodied
8073201 it was timing too good to be true we settled on dedicating the scholarship in his honor
8073202 the faa is having problems with some of their computer systems luckily at rdu we have not seen a major impact

8073206 the rest of the world lives to eat while i eat to live
8073207 traditional search engines start with one search query and return thousands or millions of search results we flip that on its head totally
8073208 we start with thousands of products in any category and play a very smart fast game of 20 questions until youre left with your one perfect product
8073209 were definitely going to roll out more sites this year as many as one a week if possible
8073210 we have a hot list of 50 sites under consideration and at any one time three or four are in different stages of roll out we just turned on myperfectcareer com au and myperfectbike is not far from internal testing
8073211 by that stage well know how big the concept of our choice engine will be
8073212 we dont want to have the choice engine concept to be brought to market by another party we see the combined weight of strong intellectual property protection and first mover advantage as a vital reason to bring in external funding and expertise
8073213 the site was inundated and we were glad to reach election day we had almost 10 000 people through the site in two weeks and based on the analysis of the questions answered we were able to correctly predict the result ahead of time
8073214 how would you explain the signal transduction of g protein coupled receptors to your granny
8073215 can you help me carry a few boxes if you have a minute
8073216 can you help me decide which one of these is a better gift for my mom
8073217 if you truly believe that you dont need anything else in the universe then why in the world you become a christian
8073218 if dealing with reality means just accepting that the world sucks then thats it
8073219 tied together then with what was talked about earlier then is if there are so many options why has religion existed for so long because alternative answers just arent fulfilling enough
8073220 in the re imagined battlestar galactica the polytheistic religion of the humans of the twelve colonies is centered on the belief of eternal recurrence and the religious elements of the show frequently incorporate this idea with the scriptural phrase
8073221 all of this has happened before and it will all happen again
8073222 an album by the artist vangelis released in 1976 it is a concept album around space and space physics
8073223 total dick head news analysis and philip k dick related info kipple chronicled by a pkd scholar
8073224 this policy is mainly in response to the travesty that occurred over fraudulent claims by south korean researcher woo suk hwang that he and his team had cloned human embryonic stem cells published in science in 2004 and 2005 therefore when these top journals decide that a certain study is bound to have an astronomical impact extra care and effort to scrutinize the original data even independently replicate the findings are required to avoid potential damage to the scientific community
8073225 good god dont watch this video unless youve got an awesome tolerance for high density super concentrated stupid and dancing howling raving demented fuckwits
8073226 this terror then this darkness of the mind not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse but only natures aspect and her law which teaching us hath this exordium nothing from nothing ever yet was born fear holds dominion over mortality only because seeing in land and sky so much the cause whereof no wise they know men think divinities are working there meantime when once we know from nothing still nothing can be created we shall divine more clearly what we seek those elements from which alone all things created are and how accomplished by no tool of gods
8073227 you know you are warranted in feeling all of these things theyre not invalid fears and frustrations
8073228 it really hurts every time you turn around peopel are so consumed with what i am that they kick me they spit on me and leave me hurt and alone
8073229 i hope the rain last through the morning because then i can do kendo in the rain
8073230 i knew coming home would be hard but if i just kept my mouth shut then i knew there would be no problems when i was home
8073231 while this is a pro active move one wonders why these regulators didnt become more aggressive a year ago note the fed and occ usually do not disclose if a bank has received a mou since the bank may not be at serious risk
8073232 it is better to have hope than to have nothing at all
8073233 a knowing and willful attempt to violate the strictures of federal election law
8073234 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
8073235 more fixed wing aircraft and helicopters for mobility more surveillance drones more satellite tasking more armored vehicles for troop protection
8073236 the afghans are patient people but theyre not seeing an effort worthy of a superpower

8073251 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8073252 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8073253 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8073254 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8073255 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8073256 all you need is 200 people in the crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8073257 first a collection of equations each modeling an interaction second each equation also interacts with every other equation third the interactions become so complex at some point it becomes easier to play with outcomes than with the equations
8073258 so how do you persuade the status quo police to stop treating you like a potential spoiler you dont i dont think you have a prayer instead you create an environment where her colleagues and her family persuade her
8073259 i know ill just dump the log4j jar file and the commons logging jar file into my web inf lib folder and put a log4j properties file in my src folder then ill install the application on the application server and set the module class loader to application first
8073260 gratitude unlocks the fullness of life it turns what we have into enough and more it turns denial into acceptance chaos to order confusion to clarity it can turn a meal into a feast a house into a home a stranger into a friend gratitude makes sense of our past brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow
8073261 our home had dozens of eucalyptus when we moved in 13 years ago we removed all but one and now are regretting that it is there sadly so many neighbors have so many eucalyptus
8073262 leaving our house in escondido we had literally no choices of where to go and we were lucky that the only choice was a good one except it was the same as everyone elses
8073263 the i 15 was closed north and south all roads east were closed
8073264 fire is burning to our house as we sit here bombers are up it is all we can hear outside otherwise most of san diego is a ghost town my other sister was just evacuated the winds are amazing miles from the fire it is impossible to breathe swirls of ash are flowing down the road and trees are down everywhere from the winds apparently as high as 70 mph maybe more everyones eyes are red rimmed in black and coughing it is grim we are so lucky in the midst of so much horror we really need nothing other than for this to stop

8073273 list ten reasons scientists give to support evidence of climate change
8073274 contrast peer review science with advocacy based commercial political agenda predict how each of these two groups would describe climate change
8073275 apply the greenhouse effect to earths atmosphere illustrate the effects of adding additional co2 to the atmosphere
8073276 arrange the evidence for climate change into two groups possible natural causes and possible human activity causes
8073277 choosing from the list of human activity causes for climate change what could we do to modify our future impact on earths atmosphere formulate your answer considering economics political systems and intrinsic human motivations
8073278 compare biofuels ethanol etc including impact on ecosystem health and world food supplies vs technology based energy solar hydro wind etc including manufacturing and transportation impact evaluate these options as long term strategies what combination of energy sources is most likely to improve earths climate toward long term human habitation
8073279 it has been many decades since we explored the moon from the lunar surface and it could be another 6 8 years before any government returns even then it will be at a large expense and probably with little public involvement
8073280 the google lunar x prize seeks to create a global private race to the moon that excites and involves people around the world and accelerates space exploration for the benefit of all humanity
8073281 the x prize foundation could think of no better sponsor and partner than google we share a common vision for opening frontiers and a belief that a small dedicated group of individuals can accomplish amazing feats at very low cost
8073282 american issues project who produced the ad and aggressively pressure tv stations who plan to run the ad

8073294 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8073295 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8073296 none of the six party talks joint statements however commits the us to any deadline for removing north korea from the list
8073297 to see how things play out in the coming weeks
8073298 i can confirm that us personnel remain on the ground at the yongbyon facility monitoring the sites
8073299 at this stage if the north koreans are not prepared to make specific commitments on verification i think the process will bog down probably for the remainder of the bush administration
8073300 i dont think the bush administration will cave in on this
8073301 we were taken to a room where all the bones they had from australia were in this room and covered by a sheet

8073303 our opportunity this week is to back up essentially and thats something that we havent been able to do for some time
8073304 when you get experiences like last week under your belt it contributes to belief if you use it in the right way if it contributes to an over confidence then it will bite you
8073305 a win would be very special not so much for the history its not something that weve spoken about thats the first ive heard of it
8073306 weve come over here with two games our focus is to win both those games so that would be very special more from the team point of view
8073307 weve obviously set our goals very high and we want to achieve those
8073308 were busy enough doing that and conscious that theres another group thats looking to do the same thing and as weve seen already a week is a very long time in rugby but the great thing from your perspective in terms of interest is theres always someone suffering
8073309 there is no evidence of any unauthorized access to any other customer data
8073310 rowing new zealand was unable to match the opportunities and responsibilities offered by australian rowing but fully understands this career move by andrew
8073311 his professionalism attention to detail and deep passion for the sport will be missed but we wish him well
8073312 if woolworths appeal to the supreme court is successful and woolworths is granted a clearance foodstuffs will also face no competition issues if it decides to purchase further shares in the warehouse
8073313 if woolworths appeal is unsuccessful again both companies are in the same position
8073314 we have previously put some strong arguments to the commission and the courts as to why any acquisition would be lawful i am comfortable that the supreme court will be in a position to properly consider the issues
8073315 we will await with interest the outcome of the woolworths appeal and as we have consistently said we would not rule anything in or anything out going forward
8073316 i would imagine it would be very hard for anyone subject to these sort of things to come forward
8073317 all i can say is that nsw police force will be providing every form of support we possibly can to make the process for them as trouble free as possible
8073318 all of the lines of inquiry that have been presented to us have been explored and are being investigated
8073319 theres no loose ends being let go at this stage
8073320 i can confirm that theres no one at the school at the moment that is subject to that inquiry
8073321 at this stage were looking at 13 victims and were following up those lines of inquiry at the moment
8073322 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8073323 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8073324 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8073325 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8073326 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8073327 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can
8073328 were pursuing those lines of inquiry and to anticipate when charges will be laid at this stage is a little bit presumptuous
8073329 if it keeps up it means an operation wont be necessary
8073330 they are pretty conservative and they want two days to go by before they will confirm it was an absolute success
8073331 but its looking very good so weve got our tails up here although its still a wait and see game
8073332 they unbandaged one of his hands and he was seeking to hold hands with his mother so that was a good bit of progress
8073333 the company has decided that for this next critical stage of the age we would have fresh editorial and executive leadership
8073334 under andrews editorship the age benefited from an innovative redesign and consistent strong growth in circulation and readership and agenda setting journalism
8073335 the age was named newspaper of the year by panpa in 2007 one of the industrys highest honours the company is discussing with andrew the ways his skills and expertise can be made available within the company
8073336 i knew when i saw the draw it was a good opportunity against oudin and i thought i did pretty well today
8073337 i was pretty pumped about playing because i knew my opponent melanie we both played in the juniors together
8073338 i know i have the tennis in me its just allowing myself to play and believe in myself and thats what im working on and i think i did a good job today
8073339 i thought serving out the second set at 5 4 i didnt do it too well but then i came back in the tie breaker so it was good
8073340 my serve is something sandon coach sandon stolle and i have been working on and i think its going really well
8073341 its more a visual thing for me and thats what weve been working on

8073351 our study confirmed that the number of suicides divorces heart ailments bp and diabetes patients and mental depression are the highest in the software industry the fancy salaries of software professionals are no longer something to rejoice about
8073352 we found that the software industry has simply no routine deadlines hang before them and every day they chase new problems during weekends more than 60 per cent of the vehicles are found parked in the office complexes there is no physical exercise and new food habits favoured by pizza culture fuel the problem cervical spondilitis and wrist problems due to uncomfortable handling of the computer mouse eye problems and discomfort in bowel movements are common the stress for couples where both are employed in the it industry is the worst the simple step of taking time off from work for three months allowed an it couple wanting a child for years to conceive one
8073353 even if the company sponsors a movie or self care lecture not many attend them
8073354 id also like to know whether climate change minister penny wong knew about that document whether she ticked it off whether in fact she was even invited to their big business roundtable this crisis meeting
8073355 that document will show us once and for all what hes proposing as an easier cop for the big end of town and whether the minister knew about it
8073356 the coal industry has had mr rudd in their pocket since before the election

8073361 he has brought out a report saying there is no problem in australia he absolutely knows that food retailing in australia 82 per cent of it is held by two people coles and woolworths

8073363 time is running out for awb to get match fit to face up to the new realities of a competitive wheat export marketing environment
8073364 we originally were approached in late november and early december and we decided to take the job because the father had actually taken the kids to a war zone
8073365 there was a kitty we used for expenses there were five to six team members but in the end i came home with a six figure debt
8073366 no we havent had any contact with ms hawach thats a given we dont expect contact or anything like that but the phone call my wife made to her to see how the girls were doing there was nothing there no she didnt ask to see how we fared
8073367 we always wanted that outcome for the girls to get back to their mum and they now have communication with their father as well by phone i have no regrets
8073368 we knew what we were doing originally the plan i had in place was to wait for a legal outcome but that went south it didnt work so we decided to stay back and go with a plan that was a lot riskier
8073369 there was not a whole lot said she put them directly in a vehicle drove out changed vehicles she talked to the girls in the back and they dropped them off to beirut
8073370 the interrogation involved physical abuse which is known as attention slapping which is a form of torture
8073371 the extreme volatility makes it impossible to provide a reliable profit forecast for the year

8073376 the extreme volatility makes it impossible to provide a reliable profit forecast for the year rex said
8073377 if the fuel prices and exchange rate stays within current levels and if our pilot attrition rate does not go beyond 25 per annum we believe that the group should be able to maintain its current level of profitability structures and career paths shift

8073382 re emageon anyone who wants the story can go to the investors page to access all sec documents message boards feature interesting opinions some very well reasoned but they are only guessing when or if emageon gets new owners will be a decision of its board
8073383 re teamwork while the so called fight over who owns pacs and other systems can get acrimonious it really should be focusing on teamwork amongst the various players in it and the departments one way to break down silo walls is to have department members and it personnel share some time each week in each others department to get educated on daily activities beth israel deaconess medical center has a program called spirit which addresses department problems and gets various others evolved to solve a problem that can help other departments as well paul levy ceo of bidmc posted a piece on lean is not about dieting on his running a hospital blog that gives you an idea of what the program is all about

8073391 if woolworths appeal to the supreme court is successful and woolworths is granted a clearance foodstuffs will also face no competition issues if it decides to purchase further shares in the warehouse
8073392 if woolworths appeal is unsuccessful again both companies are in the same position
8073393 we have previously put some strong arguments to the commission and the courts as to why any acquisition would be lawful i am comfortable that the supreme court will be in a position to properly consider the issues
8073394 we will await with interest the outcome of the woolworths appeal and as we have consistently said we would not rule anything in or anything out going forward
8073395 i would have something to tell my grandkids about that i was part of a ranked team
8073396 the discussions last week were robust and constructive and we look forward to continuing this dialogue around a revised draft exemption text at next months meeting
8073397 the key function of the nsg is to formulate guidelines for managing exports of nuclear material equipment and technology to ensure that this trade does not contribute to nuclear weapons proliferation
8073398 while new zealand remains a strong advocate of the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt and the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty ctbt and would welcome indias accession to these treaties we have not included these elements in our package of proposals
8073399 while noting concerns and the need for consistency in pursuing the objective of non proliferation
8073400 a large number of countries big and small expressed views similar to new zealands that there needed to be compatibility between the us india agreement and the goals of the nsg and indicated a willingness to engage positively to achieve that outcome
8073401 the nsg exemption should be clean and there should be no additional condition
8073402 they may want to push but india cant be pushed civil nuclear cooperation is important but that doesnt mean at any cost
8073403 should we allow ourselves to be pushed are we not indians are you not proud of yourself and what you are doing
8073404 this movement represents a small movement in net outflows combined with an unfavourable decline in the market value of equities over this period
8073405 both demand and prices for coal are likely to stay strong and within this context i am confident we will be able to further increase our revenues and profitability in the coming years
8073406 we have a robust balance sheet and healthy margins in place both of which are set to improve in the year ahead
8073407 this places us in a good position to grow the company
8073408 whilst lower prices prevailed for much of the year coal prices rose in the second half of the financial year providing a boost to revenue
8073409 production was pared back to meet reduced port allocation leading to lower sales volumes
8073410 gpgs portfolio has not been immune from the worldwide sharemarket shakeout and to that extent we believe most of those losses will be recovered and more
8073411 the majority of gpgs investments are sound strategic long term holdings where we are confident of intrinsic value regardless of share price fluctuations
8073412 arguably misplaced investment judgement where prospects of recovery were more remote and where cost exceed ed market value
8073413 however we are now supporting yet another equity issue in the hope expectation that the inevitable changes in the companys trading environment are looming ever closer and our faith will be finally rewarded
8073414 transpacific is the market leader and well positioned for solid organic growth with significant new initiatives underway
8073415 previous group organic growth targets remain we expect to achieve double digit growth for fiscal 2009
8073416 although we remain cautious given uncertainty about the outlook for global and local economic conditions we continue to believe that our irreplaceable portfolio of high quality australian assets will perform well given the solid sales growth exhibited by the retail portfolio and high levels of occupancy across our industrial and office assets
8073417 however we are clearly very disappointed with results this half and with our revised guidance for the full year as previously outlined to the market
8073418 the impact of the credit crisis on the real estate environment and markets everywhere has been unprecedented in recent history and global operating conditions remain extremely challenging
8073419 whilst our core domestic operations have continued to perform strongly our ability to derive development profits has been adversely affected as has the performance of our hotel tourism us seniors and european funds management businesses
8073420 the group will take a measured approach to asset sales in light of current market conditions and capital management requirements
8073421 we are committed to improving our balance sheet strength and maintaining varied funding sources in light of ongoing constraints in credit markets and what we see as a material and long term change in the investment market

8073429 zimmerman offered us the right level of talent not just for our advertising but to activate our entire business
8073430 we liked the people we respect the agencys accomplishments and we think adding zimmerman to our strong team will help support our continued growth strategy

8073432 no perd por molestias en la rodilla izquierda el partido se me escap en realidad en el cuarto set all saque 4 3 y deb ganar mi servicio no digo que lo ten a f cil pero s en control
8073433 creo que lo hice un poco porque ten a ganado el partido y otra porque me qued caliente con el rbitro que se equivoc en una bola f cil de su lado y era para quebrar y me puse mal ese fue el motivo de la calentura
8073434 sta ha sido una temporada de muchas cosas positivas para m el haber jugado nuevamente los torneos grandes con los buenos jugadores sentir que puedo jugar con los mejores que estoy en el mismo nivel
8073435 perd un partido que lo ten a ganado la verdad estoy bastante amargado de la manera como se me escap el triunfo
8073436 la ventaja que saqu en el cuarto no set no la aprovech pues me puse un poco ansioso al ver que estaba cerca de ganar

8073438 i was here last night ill be here through the convention i was hosting meetings doing fundraising doing everything ive done the last two conventions ive been a delegate
8073439 ive been doing a lot of interviews and stage shows and half the questions are like will mgs4 be coming out on 360 or other formats and in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware
8073440 because mgs4 was optimised for the ps3 it is probably not possible
8073441 but you know what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about hardware and platforms
8073442 if were talking about the future not mgs4 but my future titles if were referring to that if the hardware technology rises then obviously you know it wont be based on the hardware anymore probably i will first create the software and then um its a strange word to say but port to other hardware if that technological ability rises in all areas

8073446 medicine in my country is so advanced that we can take a kidney out of one man put it in another and have him looking for work in six weeks
8073447 thats nothing we can take a lung out of one person put it in another and have him looking for work in four weeks
8073448 in my country medicine is so advanced that we can take half of a heart out of one person put it in another and have them both looking for work in two weeks

8073451 no does not mean no it means that she needs more information
8073452 this is a fabrication by the sudanese government and some criminals
8073453 we denounce and condemn this act we want the protection of civilians wherever they are this is a dirty conspiracy to defame
8073454 its part of their belief system that this is not the right thing to do
8073455 this outbreak at least got going because it took hold in an unimmunized community so they are the ones who are really sitting ducks for infection
8073456 weve tried to do advertising to the general public about the importance of not sharing spit because thats how this thing has spread
8073457 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous

8073460 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8073461 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8073462 i am of a strong belief that yes we need to learn to communicate
8073463 but whether or not you can communicate shouldnt determine whether or not you have a card on the lpga tour
8073464 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8073465 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8073466 the players that are playing the best are international players and their play alone should help raise the level of the tour which it is
8073467 theres a group of younger players who all they want to do is play golf
8073468 to show emotion and be engaging they think it may affect their psyche we know that thats just not the case
8073469 it cant be that way to continue to sell our product
8073470 i think there was probably a bit of a lost opportunity for her as our champion to interact with the sponsors and fans
8073471 you lose a little bit of the human element when youre using a translator

8073478 anyone who dares to defend that they may be legitimately killed because another human being chooses to do so or for any other equally ridiculous reason should not be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name
8073479 barack obama represents the merger of two of the worst aspects of democratic politics 60s radicalism and corrupt chicago machine politics with the addition of slow joe biden to the ticket obama has added to his unsteady candidacy an epic amount of beltway cluelessness and arrogance unsupported by anything except frequent flier miles and delawares love for a chuckle headed fellow with a big smile

8073483 but the problem is that this series and this issue is no exception is so mind numbingly average everything about it is right down the middle of the aesthetic spectrum its very existence establishes the baseline for these five star reviews its two and one half stars from top to bottom mark bagleys art might be the main culprit hes a perfectly competent artist and hes fast but even though his style is recognizable it somehow ends up as the most generic comic book art possible almost every camera angle is from slightly above waist level his figures look like they were chiseled out of other better artists designs hes consistent and bland
8073484 clearly articulating electoral policy rather than micro managing the delivery of elections
8073485 the planning and running of elections need to be more robust and co ordinated we are still trying to run 21st century elections with 19th century structures and the system is under severe strain
8073486 sen barack obama continued accepting donations from oil company executives and employees last month even as he aired ads in which he stated he took no oil company money his campaign finance reports show obama has taken at least 263 000 from oil company executives family members and employees since entering the presidential race last year including 46 000 last month at least 140 000 has come in chunks of between 1 000 and 2 300 the maximum permitted under federal law

8073488 tom worked on and off for us in our wilderness education classes sharing his great passion about the outdoors with students
8073489 he was very well liked captaining the swimming and athletics teams
8073490 he also played rugby and basketball for the school and was our senior sportsperson of the year when he graduated
8073491 work to install this new state of the art technology will start as soon as possible in consultation with the school and its expected to be operational by the end of this year
8073492 the risks motorists take speeding through school zones can have deadly consequences in the blink of an eye
8073493 i am very happy that after much pressure the state government has decided to install school zone flashing warning lights at blackheath public school
8073494 this is a good result for the parents teachers school children and motorists
8073495 if there are asian honey bees still out there we want to find and destroy them
8073496 this is the furthest south we have found them to date so we will step up surveillance over a wider area
8073497 we will be looking at extending the current restricted area as far as babinda
8073498 we are sure there is at least one more nest out there so we are putting out more syrup stations to lure bees so we can track them to their nests
8073499 dna tests will be conducted to help determine if these bees are related to last years incursion and to see if they are carrying varroa mites
8073500 the mites will destroy commercial bee hives if they get a stranglehold in australia
8073501 the java strain of the a cerana detected so far did not carry the varroa mite

8073504 the nsw government is installing flashing lights at 100 new school zone sites each year for the next four years the use of fluorescent green signage should be compulsory during these upgrades and we want to see the new signs in the blue mountains as soon as possible
8073505 the safety benefits of using fluorescent products are abundantly evident road and work site personnel including nrma road patrol staff wear trademark fluorescent vests
8073506 the cost of getting children to and from school safely should not even have a dollar amount placed on it
8073507 the rta has not received any formal representation by the nrma regarding the use of fluorescent yellow green in school speed zone signs and the rta does not have evidence to suggest the change would increase visibility
8073508 swahs and katoomba hospital are working towards resuming birthing services on september 1
8073509 there are contingency plans in place to cover vacancies until recruitment has been completed
8073510 professional development strategies have been developed for katoomba hospital midwives including rotation to maternity services at nepean hospital
8073511 this strengthening of service delivery has been welcomed by staff and will continue
8073512 without the public outrage at the protest gathering on july 21 we would not have the maternity service reopening now
8073513 our concern is not that it is resuming but that it remains open to ensure that blue mountains women can actually book in and get accepted
8073514 swahs knew of this birthing services review prior to the meeting with us in july about the maternity units closure but did not disclose it
8073515 they are constantly trying to portray openness to the public but there are plenty of things we get to know only by other means
8073516 the broader underlying issue is the intention of the reviews but nobody can get an answer on where they are up to
8073517 feedback i am getting from ambulance officers is that there are high stress levels in terms of their workloads resources have not increased and nearly every job results in taking a patient to nepean hospital
8073518 the ice raid is in progress right now at howard industries in laurel mississippi
8073519 now we are all waiting to see what will happen to people being arrested at howard industries
8073520 we had been expecting the raids either on the coast or in hattiesburg we were getting information that ice was in hotels in the coast and other preparations were going on in hattiesburg
8073521 most of what we are getting today is that ice is focusing on jones county but havent had calls from all areas we have had calls from chicken plants in and around laurel we had expected the raids to occur at chicken plants it was a surprise its a different industry howard industries gets state and federal funding to operate
8073522 police are able to draw firearms when they are needed
8073523 the big gap in our tactical options is a less than lethal option that will reliably incapacitate a dangerous offender
8073524 issuing tasers to every primary response police officer would make a real difference to the safety of police the public and even offenders themselves
8073525 it is a reflection of the increasingly serious violence that is being witnessed daily by police and public alike
8073526 however our own survey of police association members in 2005 did not indicate a desire amongst most police to be regularly armed with firearms
8073527 police today are almost more afraid of having to use lethal force than they are of being subjected to it
8073528 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
8073529 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8073530 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8073531 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8073532 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
8073533 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8073534 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
8073535 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8073536 our study shows that these views are incorrect and illustrate the potential for the human brain to rapidly and dynamically reorganize itself
8073537 we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight and we believe that these principles may also apply to other sensory loss such as deafness or loss of function following brain injury

8073542 these definitions have no tendency to show that tomatoes are fruit as distinguished from vegetables in common speech or within the meaning of the tariff act
8073543 tomatoes have 9 13 species which are a window into a fascinating group of plants
8073544 our overall theme is to increase accessibility of wild species and decide what crosses you can make and what you can cross and cant cross
8073545 a tuesday august 26th 2008 at 9 25 pm rantings of an arab chick
8073546 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8073547 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8073548 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8073549 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8073550 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8073551 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8073552 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8073553 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address
8073554 the days have passed when adult children stay in the same community as their parents
8073555 more businesses popping up recognize that senior care is a wonderful business model
8073556 they gave us a roadmap of groups we should market to using proven methodologies
8073557 franchising for adult programs is big business right now as long as the quality stays with it
8073558 we like franchises because theyre good solid systems with predictable streams of royalty
8073559 we saw a real opportunity with dwyer they had a strong management team and their brands have a high level of recognition with consumers
8073560 more people want control over their lives and security for their families
8073561 owning a business is the american way and franchising is one option for them to start a business
8073562 it provides structure name recognition and a process without having to start from the ground up
8073563 then from a business perspective theres no way for franchises to grow and create more opportunities

8073652 i was with you in weakness in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of god

8073669 muhammad itu sekali kali bukanlah bapak dari seorang laki laki di antara kamu tetapi dia adalah rasulullah dan penutup nabi nabi dan adalah allah maha mengetahui segala sesuatu
8073670 tak akan tegak hari kiamat sampai ada beberapa kabilah diantara ummatku akan bergabung dengan orang orang musyrikin sampai ada beberapa kabilah diantara ummatku akan menyembah berhala sesungguhnya akan ada di antara ummatku 30 tukang dusta semuanya mengaku bahwa ia adalah nabi akulah penutup para nabi tak ada lagi nabi setelahku
8073671 sesungguhnya kerasulan dan kenabian telah terputus maka tak ada lagi rasul dan nabi setelahku
8073672 awal kemurtadan di kalangan bangsa arab adalah terjadi pada diri musailamah di negeri al yamamah pada bani hanifah al aswad bin kaab al ansiy di negeri yaman di masa hidupnya rasulullah shollallahu alaihi wasallam juga telah keluar thulaihah bin khuwailid al asadiy di kalangan bani asad dalam keadaan mengaku nabi
8073673 orang orang yang murtad setelah wafatnya rasulullah shollallahu alaihi wasallam ada dua macam 1 diantaranya ada suatu kaum yang kafir setelah masuk islam seperti thulaihah musailamah al ansiy dan pengikut mereka 2 diantaranya ada suatu kaum yang berpegang dengan islam namun mereka menahan tak mau bayar zakat
8073674 demikian pula orang yang mengakui kenabian seorang bersama nabi kita shollallahu alaihi wasallam atau setelahnya seperti sekte al isawiyyah dari kalangan yahudi yang berpendapat khususnya kerasulan nabi muhammad shollallahu alaihi wasallam pada orang arab seperti juga sekte bathiniyyah al khormiyyah yang berpendapat langgengnya kerasulan seperti kebanyakan sekte rofidhoh syiah yang berpendapat tentang keikutsertaan ali bersama nabi muhammad shollallahu alaihi wasallam dalam kerasulan dan setelahnya demikian pula setiap orang yang mengaku dapat wahyu di antara mereka sekalipun ia tak mengaku nabi mereka ini semuanya adalah kafir lagi mendustakan nabi muhammad shollallahu alaihi wasallam karena beliau shollallahu alaihi wasallam telah mengabarkan bahwa beliau adalah penutup para nabi tak ada lagi nabi setelah beliau beliau juga telah mengabarkan dari allah taala bahwa dia adalah penutup para nabi dan diutus kepada seluruh manusia
8073675 jika seseorang tak mengetahui bahwa muhammad shollallahu alaihi wasallam adalah nabi yang paling akhir maka ia bukan muslim karena perkara seperti ini adalah termasuk perkara pasti jelas
8073676 pengakuan kenabian setelah nabi kita shollallahu alaihi wasallam merupakan kekafiran menurut ijma
8073677 lihat syarh al fiqh al akbar hal 244 cet darul kutub al ilmiyyah
8073678 kondisi nabi muhammad shollallahu alaihi wasallam sebagai penutup para nabi termasuk perkara yang disebutkan oleh al kitab dijelaskan oleh sunnah dan disepakati oleh ummat orang yang mendakwakan selain ini maka ia kafir dibunuh jika ia tetap demikian
8073679 seorang akan kafir karena ia mengaku ada sekutu yaitu seorang yang menyertai kenabian nabi kita muhammad shollallahu alaihi wasallam
8073680 jika seorang mengaku nabi setelah nabi kita shollallahu alaihi wasallam atau membenarkan orang yang mengaku nabi maka semua ini adalah kekafiran
8073681 barang siapa yang mengaku nabi atau ia membenarkan orang yang mengaku nabi maka ia sungguh telah murtad karena musailamah tatkala ia mengaku nabi lalu ia dibenarkan oleh kaumnya maka mereka menjadi murtad
8073682 sudah dimaklumi bahwa barangsiapa yang berdusta atas nama allah seperti ia mengaku sebagai rasulullah utusan allah atau nabiyullah nabi allah atau ia mengabarkan berita wahyu dari allah ia dusta di dalamnya seperti musailamah al ansiy dan sejenisnya dari kalangan nabi nabi palsu maka sesungguhnya ia kafir halal darahnya
8073683 barangsiapa yang mengaku nabi atau ia membenarkan orang yang mengaku nabi maka ia kafir karena ia telah mendustakan allah dalam
8073684 tetapi dia adalah rasulullah dan penutup nabi nabi dan adalah allah maha mengetahui segala sesuatu
8073685 saya mencium ada kelompok siluman yang melakukan semacam operasi intelejen untuk memeperkeruh suasana menghancurkan ketenangan masyarakat
8073686 sebelumnya tidak pernah ada konflik islam kristen di tiba tiba muncul
8073687 countries in asia and africa are up against an insidious organized illegal rhino horn trade which can only be stopped through the formation of the rhino task force
8073688 better cross border co operation and information sharing between enforcement agencies is key to tackling the highly organized poaching operations operating in africa and asia
8073689 this is trans border syndicate we investigated the operation in palembang after we had detected pangolin shipments from kalimantan and java the pangolins were packed and ready for export to china via seaports in sumatra and java
8073690 the police in indonesia have done an excellent job and should be applauded
8073691 we hope that these criminals are prosecuted to the full extent of the law
8073692 i commend the indonesian authorities on their laudable actions in this case the illegal trade in wildlife is now a multi million dollar international business endangered wildlife is being traded for food medicines ornaments pets and more this trade is already driving many species to the brink of extinction if we dont act soon it will be too late
8073693 ensure that adequate management practices and controls are in place to prevent tiger parts and derivatives from entering illegal trade from or through such facilities
8073694 as a leader in promoting the conservation of tigers the united states has a responsibility to manage its captive tiger population effectively to prevent any emergence of illegal trade
8073695 any supply of tiger parts into the black market can stimulate trade and consumer demand which could pose a serious threat to already dwindling wild tiger populations
8073696 a new film advising consumers tourists against buying illegal wildlife products
8073697 the end consumer is as much as a partner in wildlife crime as the trader or the poacher
8073698 in recent years illegal wildlife trade has become an international organised criminal activity that can only be curbed through grassroot action as well as international co operation and collaboration at the highest levels
8073699 equally important is the need to sensitise potential buyers about the dangers of buying illegal wildlife goods and this film part of traffic indias awareness campaign aims to make buyers beware they could be buying trouble
8073700 four posters in february 2008 and now the new film

8073705 it is critical the russian government defines test fishing and clearly sets its limits
8073706 current legislation regulating the catch and use of sturgeon and caviar is inadequate and complex leaving loopholes that allow illegal trade to thrive
8073707 illegal logging and timber trade not only undermine conservation but also result in reduced profitability of legal trade loss of foreign revenue and currency exchange uncollected forest related taxes and depleted forest resources and services
8073708 eu flegt is an important step towards combating the illegal timber trade but additional measures are needed to prevent such timber from entering the eu common market
8073709 china has acted rather successfully against its own illegal domestic ivory market
8073710 now china should help other countries do the same especially in central africa where elephant poaching is rampant and chinese nationals have been implicated in moving ivory out of the region
8073711 the sight of ivory openly and illegally on sale in many african cities is likely to be a far more powerful encouragement to those contemplating poaching and smuggling than a strictly controlled one off sale
8073712 the only way to end elephant poaching is through an effective clampdown on illegal domestic ivory markets
8073713 after any ivory sale takes place cites monitoring systems will be tracking whether or not it leads to an increase in illegal trade in ivory
8073714 following the last one off ivory sale under cites in 1999 it is encouraging to note that the illicit trade in ivory progressively declined over the next five years we hope a similar result is achieved this time
8073715 i should be there by now did i make the wrong turn
8073716 we all possess some intuitive sense we know our convictions from our mere hunches
8073717 this sense of confidence or lack thereof is critical to our success but how it arises in the brain has long been a mystery
8073718 these neurons seem to have been registering after the rat made its decision how uncertain the animal was that it was about to receive its desired reward
8073719 we tested several alternative explanations but the best explanation for the neural activity we observed was that these neurons were signaling the confidence of the animal about its decisions
8073720 although previous work had suggested that confidence estimates might be a complex process restricted to humans and perhaps other primates
8073721 our results to the contrary show that for the brain to estimate confidence in a choice is no more complex than calculating the choice itself
8073722 this new option to abort and restart constitutes a decision that should be made based on the level of confidence about getting a reward
8073723 ultimately confidence about getting a reward is a direct function of the animals confidence about the decision they have just made in this way we sought to measure a variable internal to the animals how confident they were about whether they made the right choice or not by observing how it influenced their behavior
8073724 that confidence estimation is not a complex function specific to humans but a core component of the process of decision making probably found throughout the animal kingdom
8073725 future studies of this kind may illuminate the question of how we form an intuitive sense of the solidity of a belief how we distinguish fact from fiction itself
8073726 kita semua berdoa agar allah memberikan ketabahan dan keselamatan negeri ini dari tipu daya orang orang yang memusuhi agama allah
8073727 bismillahirrohmanirrohim demi allah saya meminta kepada ikhwan rohimakumullah untuk terus berjuang menegakkan syariat islam di muka bumi allahu akbar 3x
8073728 kita semua para ulama dari seluruh indonesia meminta agar beliau tetap sabar dalam menghadapi ujian ini

8073731 saya melibatkan seluruh umat beragama di indonesia kita ini kan bhineka tunggal ika jadi alangkah baiknya ramadan ini kita jadikan ajang persaudaraan
8073732 sebelum ke hongkong saya mau ke batam dulu di hongkong saya mau bertemu dengan para tkw untuk memberikan support pada mereka
8073733 yang penting adalah hati kita saat berdoa bukan tempat bahkan di atas pasir dan di areal sawah pun kita bisa salat bila memang tak ada lagi tempat yang lebih layak
8073734 consciousness does not require language nor does it require memory or perception of the world or any action in the world or emotions or even attention
8073735 this is a significant moment in global efforts to tackle wildlife crime
8073736 the high level political will is clearly there to tackle illegal wildlife trade we trust it will backed up with adequate financial and other resources to make this happen after all if the g8 cant afford to back their words up with action nobody can
8073737 this study lays the groundwork for understanding the nature of different mutations in cancers
8073738 and helps with understanding the mechanisms of cancers and their responses to drug treatments
8073739 little could darwin have known that his origin of the species would one day explain the origin of the tumor
8073740 this research report completely changes our understanding of the many gene mutations that cause cancer
8073741 d omestication took place when a handful of especially opportunistic species discovered through darwinian trial and error that they were more likely to survive and prosper in an alliance with humans than on their own humans provided the animals with food and protection in exchange for which the animals provided the humans their milk eggs and yes their flesh
8073742 these states are ones you learn about in introductory quantum mechanics classes but no one has been able to controllably create them before
8073743 in quantum mechanics the energy or amplitude of motion of this pendulum only comes in finite steps in quanta we first carefully prepared the resonator in these quantum states and showed we could do this controllably and then measure the states then we kicked the pendulum directly a method where the amplitude can take on any value and appears to not be limited to these quanta but when we look at the resonator with our qubit we see that the amplitude does come in steps but that the resonator is actually in several such states at the same time so that on average it looks like it is not limited to the quantum states
8073744 this resonator once you excite it has to swing for a very long time
8073745 the first samples i fabricated stopped oscillating very quickly we had to work to rearrange the fabrication method to get the resonator to oscillate longer
8073746 harmonic oscillators might allow us to get a quantum computer built more quickly
8073747 i think if they really build one of these quantum computers there will definitely be resonators in them
8073748 whenever we read the obscene stories the voluptuous debaucheries the cruel and tortuous executions the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the bible is filled it would be more consistent that we call it the word of a demon than the word of god it is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind

8073755 i learned from what i did a lot of people could have been hurt from this like my parents or my teammates if it went further and i did something worse
8073756 its disappointing that this scheduling error has resulted in the upcoming championship not being played at fenway park but we look forward to being at fenway in 2010
8073757 in terms of this years event we are moving swiftly to find a quality venue to host one of our premier conference championships

8073759 oh my mother does pilates not because she wants to be offensive though more for exercise
8073760 i wouldnt wish that on anyone except maybe avril lavigne
8073761 my kindergarten teacher used to wear stirrup pants all the time
8073762 its just that all these people are getting on our tram and so few of them have brushed their hair
8073763 i like her but i think that if we were in the wild id go into fight response
8073764 i firmly believe russia should never have been allowed man made fibres until they proved they could use them responsibly first
8073765 you know how hair products claim theyll add life to your hair
8073766 its just occurred to me the only way they can really do that is with lice or nits
8073767 whats that movie called the one where marianne faithfull becomes a prostitute
8073768 no see i didnt think the look in her eyes was that creepy
8073769 okay our two dogs when they were dying that was the look they got in their eyes wounded darting around like crazy frightened you might kick them
8073770 thats not her natural colour the only way you can get orange in hungary is by rolling in paprika
8073771 didnt he leave mary louise parker when she was six months pregnant for claire danes
8073772 no really what are you doing what are those in your hand

8073774 how do you want to hang the tinsel on the tree
8073775 she shows surprising emotional depth for someone in the army reserves
8073776 if youre going to tell people on national television that i tried to stuff my underwear into your mouth you need to stress that it was clean underwear

8073783 over the past few days we have received reports from users of spam and phishing attacks
8073784 we have also detected and contained a worm we are investigating every report removing false content blocking bogus links and addressing the concerns of our users these efforts have limited the affected users to a small percentage of those on facebook
8073785 it is very similar to a lot of the old worms
8073786 if you receive messages from a friend on a social network you are not expecting them to be a vehicle to carry a worm or trojan horse

8073792 it may not be the prime minister it may not be the president but the army chief is always kept in the loop
8073793 we have good news for democracy the coalition believes it is imperative to move for impeachment against general musharraf
8073794 if he does it it will be his last verdict against the people
8073795 pakistan cannot afford to see democracy derailed this is not the same pakistan as was the case in the 1980s and 1990s people will not accept it now
8073796 barack obama as well meaning as he is is simply wrong on all the major issues
8073797 in some respects joe biden is thought of as someone who can shore up barack obamas foot faults on foreign policy
8073798 his record of being wrong on foreign policy is as long as his years in the senate
8073799 i have to begin by saying where senator mccain is today i find a remarkable achievement given if you will the celebrity status which has been lavished upon barack obama the seven time magazine covers to john mccains two for john mccain to be tied with barack obama is really quite an accomplishment
8073800 im a little surprised the truth is one of the first casualties of the obama new politics campaign
8073801 was nowhere on the issue of immigration when mr mccain was pushing legislation to try to help solve it at mr romneys prompting the latino legislator also delivered his remarks in spanish
8073802 sometimes a person is born on third base and spends his her entire life thinking he shes hit a triple
8073803 the fear is that we really may be in a long continuous financial crisis
8073804 american businesses and consumers were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
8073805 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
8073806 oh my g d that is the coolest person alive
8073807 youve got to read this book it should be a movie
8073808 lets get all the information we can were going to make it ourselves

8073810 played a lot of bad guys in my career and this gave me an opportunity to play a different kind of character and hes a genuine good guy and that interested me right off the bat
8073811 didnt realize just how physically demanding it was going to be and once youre in it and there and everything its physically exhausting even the locations youre just so in it these were the nastiest locations ever
8073812 and you said they were safe but really they werent the bug wrangler said these bugs bite so you need to be careful there is one scene where literally there were like 20 bugs on me and we took them off only to find later there was one left hanging from my arm biting me
8073813 everything was so real there was no stretching to find some fear we had it wasnt difficult it was all real real bugs real eye stuff real

8073816 it is hard to fail but it is worse never to have tried to succeed
8073817 perhaps we should wait a bit and see how this 3g thing goes before we spend a lot of money
8073818 it is hard to fail but it is worse never to have tried to succeed

8073821 zabriskie point an incredibly dated looking film now but the ending where he blew up a giant modern mansion out in the desert using multiple camera angles and slow motion was a first
8073822 the amazing opening club scene of bauhaus singing bela lugosis dead in the hunger plus the incredibly great use of bach throughout that film
8073823 manhunter which uses a song from shriekback called coelacanth when the blind woman gets to pet the tiger
8073824 the scene where donnie darko and his girlfriend are walking down the stairs in slow motion together to under the milky way tonight by the church its just after theyd gone to bed for the first time and their movements are perfectly in sync with one another its a blissful relaxed moment just before the movie turns truly apocalyptic at the end

8073828 well i dont buy things you need to keep cold
8073829 its not that they do not want one they cant afford them or the electricity to run it
8073830 what experience and history teach is this that people and governments never have learned anything from history or acted on principles deduced from it
8073831 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of currency the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of their property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered

8073835 the christian religion is a parody on the worship of the sun in which they put a man called christ in the place of the sun and pay him the adoration originally paid to the sun
8073836 the religious impulse is essentially ineradicable until or unless the human species can conquer its fear of death and its tendency to wish thinking

8073857 the only reason linux doesnt have viruses is because ms has 90 of all systems and all virus writers use linux so they dont want to pee in their own pool
8073858 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
8073859 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain

8073862 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city

8073873 mom here hasnt yet grasped that a president mccain wont be setting iraq policy for the next 18 years let alone the next hundred b moveons candidate of choice has himself been dropping some dark hints lately about
8073874 in what way does senator obama not look like the other president s on dollar bills
8073875 its great the light package striping and goldleafing really set it apart from all the others

8073888 mccain is my friend and brother and i love him dearly but i think you learn something fighting on the ground like me and john kerry and chuck hagel did in vietnam
8073889 mccain was a fighter pilot who dropped laser guided missiles from 35 000 feet he was long gone when they hit
8073890 what happened when they the missiles get to the ground he doesnt know you have to care about the lives of people mccain never gets into those issues
8073891 we have been the cowards lobbing cruise missiles from 2 000 miles away thats cowardly staying in the airplane when it hits the building say what you want about it its not cowardly
8073892 well make peace with foreign people and end jihad because hes black

8073934 mccain doesnt understand what its like to have family in iraq
8073935 bup bup bup no no no senator mccain said he wouldnt use his son for political purposes why is he exploiting his son like this does he hate the military didnt he fire laser cannons from orbit during the vietnam war anyway
8073936 i have nevertheless asked him to use this opportunity to reflect on his recent statements and actions in the light of the churchs regulations for all catholic priests
8073937 we were attacked because we were in saudi arabia that was the message of osama was that because we had our bases in the middle east he attacked the united states
8073938 sure why do we have bases in the middle east we totally violated the rights of that country why do we get to have bases in the middle east
8073939 i can tell you that it is succeeding i can look you in the eye and tell you its succeeding we have drawn down to pre surge levels basra mosul and now sadr city are quiet and its long and its hard and its tough and there will be setbacks
8073940 if its working senator do you now have a better estimate of when american forces can come home from iraq
8073941 no but thats not too important whats important is the casualties in iraq americans are in south korea americans are in japan american troops are in germany thats all fine american casualties and the ability to withdraw we will be able to withdraw general petraeus is going to tell us in july when he thinks we are but the key to it is that we dont want any more americans in harms way that way they will be safe and serve our country and come home with honor and victory not in defeat which is what senator obamas proposal would have done im proud of them and theyre doing a great job and we are succeeding and its fascinating that senator obama still doesnt realize that
8073942 unbelievably out of touch and inconsistent with the needs of americans and particularly the families of troops who are over there
8073943 but the key to it is that we dont want any more americans in harms way
8073944 mccains statement today that withdrawing troops doesnt matter is a crystal clear indicator that he just doesnt get the grave national security consequences of staying the course osama bin laden is freely plotting attacks our efforts in afghanistan are undermanned and our military readiness has been dangerously diminished we need a smart change in strategy to make america more secure not a commitment to indefinitely keep our troops in an intractable civil war
8073945 crack team of cybernauts will form a rapid response internet war room to track and respond aggressively to online rumours that barack obama is unpatriotic and a muslim
8073946 the war room comes as the obama campaign prepares a series of biographical speeches television advertisements and campaign appearances to tell his life story an attempt to make voters more familiar with him despite his long nomination fight against mrs clinton his campaign aides concede that millions of americans still feel that they do not really know him
8073947 why im a crack cybernaut why cant i do the same thing
8073948 on the day barack obama hoped to unite his party after wheezing over the finish line and claiming the democrat nomination a jury in his hometown of chicago convicted his longtime friend and fundraiser tony rezko of multiple felonies this is further proof that obamas high flying rhetoric is just that and in no way represents the kind of change our nation demands todays verdict and obamas friendship with rezko raise serious questions about whether he has the judgment to serve as president

8074007 maar winnie mandelas vrouw die hebben wij toch aan onze kant
8074008 een negatieve dag voor jouw teken op je werk wordt er wat afgeroddeld doe daar liever niet aan mee des te beter als je op vakantie bent want zo hoef je je niet om dit soort dingen druk te maken
8074009 o k jason wel in t nederlands a u b je schrijft op je faceboek dat je vlot nederlands spreekt bewijs dit nu maar eens
8074010 de fbi speelt een actieve rol in de opsporing van de hackers zo hebben wij verleden week nog een affaire van hacking opgelost half live werd continu gehackt en hun broncodes werden alzo ontfutseld deze personen hackers zullen nu weten wat ze gedaan hebben iedereen kan beroep doen op de diensten van deze afdeling van de fbi hierdoor laat de fbi zien dat ze de cyber criminaliteit serieus neemt we proberen dit ook wereldkundig te maken omdat zoveel mogelijk gedupeerden van ons werk kunnen gebruik maken waardoor deze besmetting misschien kan ingedamd worden de bbc maakte een reportage over onze werkzaamheden en vele t v stations kochten deze reportage aan waaronder ook tv1
8074011 ik zie dat jou hackers goed doorwerken je recentste items staan reeds op die parallelblog
8074012 ik een klacht indienen jason ik denk er niet aan heel dit fijne amusement naar de klo n neen ik ben wel graag op de hoogte van hoe alles in zijn werk gaat
8074013 vind jij dit dan kunnen derfla dit is crimineel en met je weigering blijft dit gespuis verder doen na jou volgen er nog anderen
8074014 o k derfla maar wij zijn nu op de hoogte van deze affaire ik kan je niet beloven dat wij hier geen werk gaan van maken hoor
8074015 je doet maar jason maar ik heb je geen opdracht gegeven dat je dit maar goed onthoudt
8074016 goed dan derfla hoe is het met l je zoon
8074017 eigenlijk prima zijn vriendin komt naar nederland waar ze een leerstoel heeft aangeboden gekregen hun nieuw zeelands avontuur zit er op na november dit jaar nog een vraagje jason
8074018 neen neen derfla maak je maar niet ongerust tenzij de man ook een kunstgebit heeft want dit zou hij wel eens kunnen inslikken van het verschieten als wij hem aangetekend op de hoogte brengen van wat wij ontdekt hebben
8074019 hahahaha dan moet hij maar pudding eten dan krijgt hij alzo toch nog iets binnen hahaha de groetjes ginder en hou me op de hoogte bye
8074020 it was a different love it was not like anything i had ever felt in my live before my dog was so cute his sharp eyes were always squinted so that his face had a strained look when i dreamed at night the face of my dogfriend was always before me massive en gentle and in my waking thoughts we were eternally united i dont know just leave me be please just let me sit here in peace a moment but how can he be truly dead when he still lives in my soul and in the souls of those who are left behind
8074021 lachen is gezond zeggen ze maar het lukt me niet

8074033 we have enjoyed a great working relationship with harman over the past seven years and now with this final settlement we have successfully concluded our purchase of orban inc from harman
8074034 i cant say enough about the professionalism of the harman team they have always been very honest and fair in all our many different transactions an attitude that starts with the companys ceo sidney harman and then to every member of the harman team
8074035 i helped build the first ones and im proud to be here as the last one goes out
8074036 ive worked 23 years with crl and these tv products have enjoyed a great run serving stations everywhere
8074037 for a product line like this to have a 20 year life span in this fast changing industry in almost unheard of we wont ever see this kind of equipment life span again we are proud of the service these units have provided to television broadcasters
8074038 we recognized that many am broadcasters need an audio processor with the features and pricing of our new optimod am 9300 we are very pleased with the performance of this newest processor in our am radio product line
8074039 for many years our television customers have been asking for a solution to the processing demands of surround sound 5 1 and 7 1 along with the need for local insertion for news weather and sports this next generation optimod will provide the function and control necessary for up to eight channels simultaneously giving the television station or internet streaming station full control of their processing requirements
8074040 if the instructions tell you to do this by hand wear safety gloves because its common to find bits of broken glass trapped around the strainer
8074041 heating water eats up energy so whenever possible switch to the warm or even better the cold setting rinse all loads in cold water

8074047 kitchens or kitchen areas have become glamorous showpieces as well as functional spaces and even practical features like cooker hoods have been reinvented
8074048 people are driving themselves to become more eco friendly and to live more sustainable lives this really has been a catalyst for the eco chic revolution of late people want sustainable style not just sustainable
8074049 heating water eats up energy so whenever possible switch to the warm or even better the cold setting rinse all loads in cold water
8074050 if youve worn an item once and its spotless hang it outside or in the bathroom when you take a shower to freshen it up
8074051 the advantage of the external water and ice dispenser is the ability to get fresh filtered water anytime without having to open the fridge door
8074052 the whirlpool brand is a household name their history and knowledge in the white goods industry is well known so it comes as no surprise to learn that their new dishwasher and washing machine are both seriously effective
8074053 there are plenty of things you can do yourself to make your home a much more attractive and comfortable place to live many of which wont cost the earth
8074054 and if you do decide to sell one day they could add value too
8074055 i hope that in these recessionary and more environmentally aware times we will question our throwaway culture and will begin to insist that what we buy will last
8074056 the options and programs have their own control buttons and the remaining washing time is automatically displayed according to the selected program
8074057 an energy efficient fridge freezer uses only a third of the energy to do the same job as a ten year old appliance thats a saving of up to 37 a year

8074065 though the market for nanoparticles will approach one billion dollars next year
8074066 well we do it this way because thats the way that everybody else does it
8074067 the feedstock for the chloride process is a mineral rutile or synthetic beneficiates containing over 90 percent tio2 a suitable ore blend is mixed with a source of carbon and the two are reacted in a fluidized bed with chlorine at approximately 900 c 1650 degrees the reaction yields titanium tetrachloride ticl4 and the chlorides of all the impurities present
8074068 to ensure efficient sulfation by agitation with concentrated sulfuric acid
8074069 the pulp is then separated from the mother liquor and extensively washed to remove residual traces of metallic impurities using chelating agents if necessary the washed pulp is treated with chemicals which adjust the physical texture
8074070 whilst tio2 may improve the durability of an organic binder paint or plastic by adsorbing ultra violet radiation free radicals are produced at its surface which leads to photocatalytic breakdown
8074071 nanos troubled waters latest toxic warning shows nanoparticles cause brain damage in aquatic species and highlights need for a moratorium on the release of new nanomaterials
8074072 titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are commonly used in drug and cosmetic products
8074073 titanium dioxide for example is a generally nonreactive substance used in many products including skin lotions and house paints
8074074 some sunscreens have ultraviolet absorbing nanoparticles so small they cannot reflect light making them invisible
8074075 one thing weve concluded is whatever these things nanomaterials are going to do theyre not inert what will they do when they get in the environment and what will they do when they get into people
8074076 the nanomaterial itself may be benign but in the same way that proteins will bind to nanomaterials in the bloodstream toxins such as pesticides could bind with nanoparticles in water facilitating their transport into the body
8074077 the point is we dont know what accumulated amounts of any human made nanomaterial will do in our lungs or our livers or in our groundwater even if we do know how bigger particles of the same material behave in our lungs and livers and groundwater and so far no one has bothered to find out
8074078 1997 titanium dioxide zinc oxide nanoparticles from sunscreen are found to cause free radicals in skin cells damaging dna
8074079 the nanotechnology revolution may design particles that are very different chemically from the ones we are exposed to and they might have very different properties that made them more harmful we should be vigilant
8074080 though the market for nanoparticles will approach one billion dollars next year neither government regulations nor labeling requirements exist in any country because nanoparticles are composed of elements and compounds whose toxicity is well studied at larger scales they have been assumed safe even though they can exhibit wildly different properties from their larger siblings
8074081 pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the environment agents of subtle change
8074082 personal care products aquatic pollution is particularly troublesome because aquatic organisms fish frogs turtles manatees etc are captive to continual life cycle exposure effects could accumulate so slowly that major change goes undetected until the cumulative level of these effects finally cascades to irreversible change
8074083 the literature shows however that many of these compounds survive biodegradation many of these personal care products and their metabolites are ubiquitous and display persistence in and bioconcentration from surface waters on par with those of the widely recognized organochlorine pollutants
8074084 this substance agent propylene glycol has not undergone a complete evaluation and determination under us epas iris program for evidence of human carcinogenic potential
8074085 purification section data there are three key purification issues for this project 1 removal of the sodium required for the reactor usually getting the sodium out as soon as practical is suggested since sodium can cause fouling salting problems in downstream equipment 2 energy efficient removal of the water in the sorbitol feed
8074086 microbial catalysis for the conversion of sugars and other renewable materials to propanediols
8074087 a non organically produced agricultural product or a non agricultural ingredient included on the national list that is extracted without the use of a synthetic volatile solvent or which does not contain propylene glycol as a carrier if commercially available shall be selected in preference to a product or ingredient that is extracted with a synthetic volatile solvent or which contains propylene glycol as a carrier
8074088 the verification status of this chemical is currently not verifiable this substance agent has not undergone a complete evaluation and determination under us epas iris program for evidence of human carcinogenic potential
8074089 it has been shown that propylene glycol has severe adverse health effects and has been found to cause contact dermatitis kidney damage and liver abnormalities inhibits skin growth in human tests damages cell membranes causing skin rashes dry skin and surface damage

8074094 published scientific estimates on the number of animals to be used suggest from 600 000 to 1 2 million animals will be used for every 1 000 chemicals tested the animals that will be used for testing include rodents birds frogs flies mysid shrimp and fish
8074095 the data provided in the submitted dossier does not support the requested use of benzethonium chloride as a preservative in leave on body care products
8074096 the high dose produced growth depression increased irritability respiratory signs in the parents and decreased viability and body weight of pups at birth
8074097 in a teratogenicity study the high dose group showed decreased maternal body weight and an increased number of smaller pups an increased incidence of skeletal variants occurred in all treated groups
8074098 benzethonium chloride is used as an antiinfective in veterinary medicine as a topical antiseptic and as a cationic detergent cationic detergents are used agriculturally in herbicides and in antiseptics spermicides astringents germicides disinfectants and preservatives hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in twelve of forty two individuals treated with a topical preparation containing benzethonium chloride
8074099 benzethonium chloride is a disinfectant quaternary ammonium compound cationic detergent contained mainly in cleansing agents but also in locally active medications against sore throat spermicides cationic detergents are more toxic than other detergents toxicity of concentrated solutions more than 5 10 is based upon their caustic action and upon their systemic toxic effects symptoms after dermal application of a concentrated solution are irritation dermatitis and bullous lesions contamination of the eye may lead from mild discomfort to corneal lesions depending on the concentration oral application of concentrated solutions leads to caustic burns of the oral and esophageal mucosa nausea emesis abdominal pain diarrhea pulmonary edema hypotension metabolic acidosis and depression of the central nervous system sleepiness to coma seizures and death grapefruit seed extracts containing benzethonium chloride in concentrations of 7 11 represent a major health risk if larger amounts of a concentrated solution are ingested i e by mouthful exposure of the skin or the eye may cause toxic symptoms the swiss toxicological information centre discourages consumers from administration of these extracts unless it is known which of them are containing benzethonium chloride and what the concentrations are

8074117 i am perfectly certain that my ship is sound but still i feel it my duty to have her examined before trusting the lives of so many people to her
8074118 however convinced you were of the justice of your cause and the truth of your convictions you ought not to have made a public attack upon any mans character until you had examined the evidence on both sides with the utmost patience and care
8074119 i am a busy man i have no time for the long course of study which would be necessary to make me in any degree a competent judge of certain questions or even able to understand the nature of the arguments
8074120 how far and in what manner may we add to our experience in forming our beliefs
8074121 not enough people eat enough fish in this country on a barbeque so i would do prawns squid sardines and mackerel those kinds of foods are good for you and also healthy and inexpensive
8074122 set the washing machine temperature to cold or warm and the rinse temperature to cold as often as possible

8074240 this was a decisive investment for us as we have to maintain our excellent position in the private broadcast market
8074241 the sound of the radio program is one of the most crucial points in the technical domain because it determines how our product reaches the customer
8074242 i was really enthusiastic about the sound when i heard the optimod fm 8500 the first time but its not only the sound which prompted us buy the 8500 the fact that we can be absolutely sure to be compliant to the itu regulation in terms of multiplex power and deviation without making compromises in the sound was the most important argument for us
8074243 but its ours why should we not use it leih

8074272 we feel fortunate to have someone with kevins experience and expertise on staff to step into the important position of north american sales manager he has been a valued asset to orban crl for many years and is very deserving of this promotion
8074273 we believe that our focused effort to visit as many customers as we can has contributed to our record sales performance in 2005
8074274 orban recently introduced several new products and technologies our customers need to see and hear what we have to offer
8074275 the 9400 has been a complex product to develop but we are very satisfied with the final result we realized early in the 9400s design process that am stations need more than just agc and peak limiting on their digital channels particularly because of the preponderance of talk on am these stations also need orban quality five band compression and limiting to ensure spectral consistency and smooth source to source continuity on the digital channel however the analog and digital five band compressor limiters require very different thresholds crossover frequencies and time constants appropriate equalization settings and peak limiting technologies are very different as well thats why the 9400 is essentially two processors in one
8074276 this is a high quality full featured aac he aac aacplus encoder with all the necessary tools and features in one application it is no longer necessary to use several potentially incompatible applications for various file operations
8074277 zey keep zem here to protect us from our president

8074288 i wrote jewel in part because i recognize the absence of womens voices in the way islamic history is told

8074290 i voted for grakal ski i thought hed be ideal for the nineteen ambitious intelligent loyal the others voted for you after your campaigns in the eight i hated you for that a woman in charge of one of the most important territories in the war i wondered whether we had descended to the perversity of the fusion
8074291 youre not as good a liar as you think you are sie
8074292 pull this off sie and youll be looking at the first female generalship in perlim history
8074293 if god has a refrigerator your picture is on it
8074294 how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them if i should count them they are more in number than the sand when i awake i am still with thee
8074295 well there goes so and so hope she has a good day
8074296 not with eyeservice as menpleasers but in singleness of heart fearing god and whatsoever ye do do
8074297 i had developed a negative destructive thought pattern the only way i knew to turn things around and change my thinking was to soak my mind and heart in the word of god the way one soaks her body in a hot bathtub of water
8074298 i see thee not i feel thee not but thou art certainly and graciously here where i am as i am
8074299 thou art here though the bush does not seem to burn with fire it comments rss
8074300 dont give up your power over the most important words of your life take control its your life its your death its your stone you say something
8074301 adorn the doctrine of god our savior in all things
8074302 let us so live that when we die we live on like abel who being dead yet speaketh the only way to do this is to live in the power of the immortal god under the influence of his holy spirit then out of our graves we shall speak to future generations
8074303 put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him
8074304 we need only to recognize god intimately present with us to address ourselves to him every moment that we may beg his assistance for knowing his will in things doubtful and for rightly performing those which we plainly see he requires of us offering them to him before we do them and giving him thanks when we have done
8074305 o my god since you art with me and i must now in obedience to your commands apply my mind to these outward things i beseech you to grant me the grace to continue in your presence and to this end do you prosper me with your assistance receive all my works and possess all my affections
8074306 i know that for the right practice of it the heart must be empty of all other things because god will possess the heart alone and as he cannot possess it alone without emptying it of all besides so neither can he act there and do in it what he pleases unless it be left vacant to him
8074307 let us thus think often that our only business in this life is to please god that perhaps all besides is but folly and vanity
8074308 we must know before we can love in order to know god we must often think of him and when we come to love him we shall then also think of him often for our heart will be with our treasure this is an argument which well deserves your consideration
8074309 you would think it rude to leave a friend alone who came to visit you why then must god be neglected do not then forget him but think on him often adore him continually live and die with him this is the glorious employment of a christian in a word this is our profession if we do not know it we must learn it
8074310 i consider myself as the most wretched of men full of sores and corruption and who has committed all sorts of crimes against his king touched with a sensible regret i confess to him all my wickedness i ask his forgiveness i abandon myself in his hands that he may do what he pleases with me this king full of mercy and goodness very far from chastising me embraces me with love makes me eat at his table serves me with his own hands gives me the key of his treasures he converses and delights himself with me incessantly in a thousand and a thousand ways and treats me in all respects as his favorite it is thus i consider myself from time to time in his holy presence my most usual method is this simple attention and such a general passionate regard to god to whom i find myself often attached with greater sweetness and delight than that of an infant at the mothers breast so that if i dare use the expression i should choose to call this state the bosom of god for the inexpressible sweetness which i taste and experience there if sometimes my thoughts wander from it by necessity or infirmity i am presently recalled by inward motions so charming and delicious that i am ashamed to mention them
8074311 yet i cannot bear that this should be called delusion because the soul which thus enjoys god desires herein nothing but him if this be delusion in me it belongs to god to remedy it let him do what he pleases with me i desire only him and to be wholly devoted him
8074312 his life is the result of principle his actions flow from settled sure and fixed convictions and therefore his integrity is maintained when others fail
8074313 god is unchangeable and therefore faith is invincible for it sets the heart on him fastens it there on the rock of eternity then let winds blow and storms arise it cares not
8074314 honesty and integrity are better cornerstones for an honorable house than mere cunning and avarice or even talent and push

8074322 not called did you say not heard the call i think you should say put your ear down to the bible and hear him bid you go and pull sinners out of the fire of sin put your ear down to the burdened agonized heart of humanity and listen to its pitiful wail for help go stand by the gates of hell and hear the damned entreat you to go to their fathers house and bid their brothers and sisters and servants and masters not to come there and then look christ in the face whose mercy you have professed to obey and tell him whether you will join heart and soul and body and circumstances in the march to publish his mercy to the world

8074329 the future of digital radio is streaming technology using world standard audio codecs such as aacplus from coding technologies
8074330 fmextra in combination with orbans opticodec fundamentally changes the distribution model for broadcasting digital audio there is no longer any distinction between internet streaming cellular streaming and broadcast streaming
8074331 orbans opticodec streaming software is mpeg4 standards based and can already address multiple devices like media players in computers and 3gpp mobile devices
8074332 adding the ability to feed the fmextra transmission chain makes it easier for broadcasters netcasters and narrowcasters to make high quality aacplus encoded audio ubiquitous

8074336 we have a lot of new faces this season which is not a bad thing
8074337 we have players that can play it is just how we bring it together there is more competition this season and we are trying kids in different positions this is the deepest team we have ever had by far and that is a good problem
8074338 the senior class has the opportunity to be the most decorated in rowan history
8074339 they can make their fourth straight appearance in the national tournament we need to not just make it but to put ourselves in the position to make a stronger showing
8074340 michelle is one of the fastest players on the team
8074341 we expect her to pick up where she left off last season dana and mandy are both looking very good in the preseason
8074342 she is a big strong and very fast player evynn will see playing time up top in her first season
8074343 krista is a steady player in the middle of the field and the most vocal leader
8074344 she does what we ask her to do we are looking for kaitlyn to regain her sophomore form when she was one of the leading scorers on the team last year she concentrated on defense
8074345 the experienced players are really being challenged by the newcomers and that is making them work harder kate and leah will be floaters between the midfield and back both are versatile players that are big and strong
8074346 she is looking to end her career with a very successful senior season megan and caitlin messaros are expected to pick up where they left off last year caitlin toomey is back to her freshman form i will be counting on a better year out of them we gave up some cheap goals last year and i want them to firm that up ashley has experience and looks good in the preseason christine can also play midfield but she will see more time at back
8074347 if she stays healthy she will be one of the top njac goalies and if she works hard she will be one of the top keepers in the country jillian will be looking for some time as a rookie kate will also see play at forward

8074367 we realized early in the 9400s design process that am stations need more than just agc and peak limiting on their digital channels particularly because of the preponderance of talk on am these stations also need orban quality five band compression and limiting to ensure spectral consistency and smooth source to source continuity on the digital channel however the analog and digital five band compressor limiters require very different thresholds and time constants appropriate equalization settings and peak limiting technologies are very different as well thats why the 9400 is essentially two processors in one
8074368 this is truly one am processor that does it all finally hd am broadcasters can obtain a single box solution that allows them to deliver the best possible quality on both their analog and digital channels

8074375 i have to tell you in 15 years of doing this job this one goes off the end
8074376 lets just assume its stupidity id still oblige her to hold a press conference saying she misrepresented the teachings of the catholic church
8074377 since she spoke as a catholic will there be any action taken by the archdiocese to refute her
8074378 the church has always taught that human life deserves respect from its very beginning and that procured abortion is a grave moral evil
8074379 is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills
8074380 regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8074381 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops

8074401 but many enjoyed the return of german pride and many more were too busy to care i was one of those who just thought the nazis were a bunch of fools so the majority just sat back and let it all happen then before we knew it they owned us and we had lost control and the end of the world had come my family lost everything i ended up in a concentration camp and the allies destroyed my factories

8074413 we intend to remain the worlds leading manufacturer of audio processing for radio television and the internet our design excellence comes from our core team of vice president co founder bob orban and his outstanding staff of engineers and design experts it is appropriate that the northern california research and design center group remain in the bay area close to the countrys most advanced digital technology enterprises
8074414 the high cost of building our products in california has caused us to lay off some employees in the san leandro facility and to offer relocation packages to those key manufacturing personnel who are willing to move their families to tempe phoenix arizona area i expect that those who relocate will enjoy a higher standard of living given the high cost of housing in the bay area we regret losing some of the loyal devoted employees who have produced our products over the past 35 years we are working closely with the state of california to find jobs for the affected personnel who wish to remain in the bay area
8074415 in a world of ever changing demand the difference between mediocre and magnificent is how well you exceed your customer expectations we have to reach beyond our competition to take advantage of the tremendous growth we see in our markets consolidating our u s production facilities allows us to capitalize on our lean manufacturing strengths being a world class supplier with efficient processes provides our customers with high quality products and services delivered on time and of excellent value

8074599 and in the future we expect to be able to expand customer options for submitting applications by mail and the internet to avoid trips into county offices if customers prefer that option

8074715 an unhealthy relationship on an emotional level with a female member of his staff
8074716 to refrain from all public ministry for a season to receive counsel in his personal life
8074717 many of us would rather watch a noisy demonstration of miracles signs and wonders than have a quiet bible study
8074718 yet we are faced today with the sad reality that our untempered zeal is a sign of immaturity our adolescent craving for the wild and crazy makes us do stupid things its way past time for us to grow up
8074719 godly leaders are supposed to protect the sheep from heresy

8074721 anyone who is in services 4 to 6 hours a day 7 days a week for weeks on end is bound to have some type of breakdown
8074722 anyone who covers himself with tattoos while in the ministry raises questions about his stability
8074723 anyone who talks about the angel of the healing revival that ministered to a a allen and william branham must have overlooked the fact that allen and branham both were discredited with moral shortcomings anyone who baptizes people in the name of the father the son and bam is playing lightly with the holy spirit and is bordering on blasphemy

8074726 there is a dynamic that makes charismatic leader situations sometimes treated differently and it is partly tied to the very term charismatic
8074727 because this person is perceived to have charismatic power or anointing his or her failure in marriage is often easily forgiven and overlooked
8074728 john hagee of cornerstone church in san antonio divorced his wife of 15 years in 1975 and the next year remarried but his ministry and influence only grew in the years after that richard roberts son of oral roberts also divorced his first wife after 11 years of marriage and 10 months later remarried paula white and her husband randy divorced last year it was paula whites second marriage while these divorces have had ramifications for their ministries in every case the ministry only flourished afterwards in most other evangelical traditions the impact of divorce has been more deeply felt by the ministers in question
8074729 we do not know all the details of bentleys marital situation and so we should withhold judgment on that matter
8074730 what is plain is that he is teaching false doctrine and that the claims to his ministrys successes seem pretty spurious
8074731 i spoke with a very influential swiss pentecostal theologian and pastor a few years ago walter hollenweger who had invited branham to zurich to hold meetings in the early 1960s
8074732 he said branham pronounced scores of people to be healed of their ailments but a half year later not a single one of those persons was actually healed and many had died branhams personal charisma had carried him and i suspect something similar is happening with bentley
8074733 and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not
8074734 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity

8074797 a number of major jewish organizations have condemned the decision which they believe will simply make america a more violent place they include
8074798 jews in particular should take note its puzzling many jews seem to prefer heavy government intervention and its not a good thing
8074799 often have the mistaken belief that the government is a beneficent force to always do good and help people out statistics indicate that gun ownership tends to reduce crime and increase public safety moreover self protection is a fundamental right
8074800 because citizens cannot always depend on the government to protect them from criminals or tyrannical rulers
8074801 the simple truth born of experience is that tyranny thrives best where government need not fear
8074802 if a few hundred jewish fighters in the warsaw ghetto could hold off the wehrmacht for almost a month with only a handful of weapons six million jews armed with rifles could not so easily have been herded into cattle cars

8074810 when making your choice in life do not neglect to live
8074811 it is by chance we met by choice we became friends
8074812 destiny is no matter of chance it is a matter of choice it is not a thing to be waited for it is a thing to be achieved
8074813 if you limit your choices only to what seems possible or reasonable you disconnect yourself from what you truly want and all that is left is a compromise

8074815 live your dream by making deliberate choices not just responding to whatever life throws your way

8074922 for the most part the way the coach has been handling it pulling me out of stuff i dont need to be doing with pain its been good hes been allowing me to rest my back and take care of myself starters dont plan on playing too much in this game anyway so it gives me a few more days to rest and to get ready for the bigger picture and the big picture is getting ready for the jets
8074923 my feeling right now is that joey will be fine and joey will be ready to go i mean right now this is a minor little deal and he should be fine when were ready to take the field for practice on monday
8074924 obviously youre concerned just for joe and i think we have to be concerned a little bit but ive seen this guy play through some pretty good pain even since ive been here and thats been his history so i know that when it comes time for the games joey will be ready to play
8074925 by the time we got to the second defensive series we were in the second quarter he didnt want to let me go in
8074926 i was like coach i only played eight plays i put on all this stuff took all this medicine and all that youve got to give me more than eight plays im all doped up now so you got to let me go he gave it to me
8074927 i think he needs to progress no doubt about it we need to see charlie and this doesnt have anything to do with charlies performance it just has to do with charlie not being able to be out there because of his injury
8074928 so we need to get charlie a lot of at bats if we can out there thursday and i was kidding around with him yesterday and told him his tongue is going to be dragging at the end of this so well see we need to be smart with him but we do have to get him out there and get him a lot of work this weekend
8074929 it was tough being injured in the first game and i was really down on myself being injured that early in the preseason but all things happen for a reason and im just trying to take this thing in stride and come out of it on a positive note
8074930 its been kind of hard in practice not really going full speed so its hard to kind of test where you are ive just been doing short bursts so its hard to really tell right now ive been in the classroom trying to watch film on rushes and coverages and things like that watching the guys in practice and learning the ins and out of the defense so i think im right there with it
8074931 ive been really impressed with jason im not telling you any secrets now you guys were there youve seen it
8074932 in the game the other night jason allen played in the dime package he played in the base as the safety and he also played as a corner on the boundary during the course of that game thats really difficult the defense in what we do has been a little bit easier for those safeties as a whole not just jason and i think jason has done a really nice job working at it hes spent a lot of time with secondary coach todd bowles

8075002 any dangerous spot is tenable if brave men will make it so
8075003 they take something totally out of context and spin it
8075004 somehow the dems have been able in their infinite wisdom to take the woman who won 18 million votes over the last year and make sure she isnt the 1 or 2 on the ticket
8075005 would someone tell me why we are even having a convention
8075006 it takes more than having the ability to speak aloud to step into the shoes of a political lion and not trip on the shoe strings left unknotted by time
8075007 and you wont see me in a pantsuit again until im running again for president
8075008 one of the things im learning about obama is that he can be bluffed fooled and intimidated
8075009 barack obama knows what its like to be a working person
8075010 greek temples were structures built to house the cult statues within greek sanctuaries the functions of the temple mainly concentrated on the cella the
8075011 barack obama knows what its like to be a working person
8075012 four years ago if you said wed be at a hillary happy hour at the dnc i would have called you crazy but today is a great opportunity for people who agree that sen barack obama doesnt have the experience to be president of the united states
8075013 im a registered republican for the first time in my voting life
8075014 he reminds me of what the jimmy carter era was like if they think jimmy carter had it bad just wait if obama gets into the white house that will be bad news in so many ways
8075015 his lack of experience has been demonstrated so painfully every time he opens his mouth just about you cannot have good judgment without experience thats how you get it
8075016 just discredited her because of some imagined baggage she carried from her husbands administration
8075017 the simple fact remains change will occur anyway no matter who the president is for every man woman and child change will happen question is who is best able to handle that change
8075018 the dnc really pushed barack obama on us now theyve left us with two choices somebody who has no substance or a republican
8075019 and these are terrible choices and they worked hard to select this candidate were watching the dnc pick this candidate for us
8075020 were taking a stand and not backing down its we the people not we the dnc we are standing up for what is right i know in my heart
8075021 oh yeah buddy then why did you give me free will
8075022 were all in this together thats what this party believes
8075023 in my own life in my own small way i have tried to give back to this country that has given me so much

8075048 i ran for student government president against several boys and lost which did not surprise me but still hurt especially because one of my opponents told me i was really stupid if i thought a girl could be elected president as soon as the election was over the winner asked me to head the organizations committee which as far as i could tell was expected to do most of the work i agreed
8075049 biden described the race as the most incredible opportunity since the days of president franklin roosevelt

8075054 here we are at the democratic convention where bloviating is the order of the day
8075055 when obama walks into a room you just want to follow him and it doesnt matter where
8075056 theres no good reason for them to choose him over me
8075057 dont tell me its a matter of keeping the partys dignity everyone knows those kennedys couldnt keep it in their pants any better than i can
8075058 its a gut reaction that reducing costs is going to be the salvation of media groups who are struggling in these difficult times one would have thought that the way to attract readers is to produce the best quality journalism we can

8075107 therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall
8075108 o lord do not rebuke me in your anger nor chasten me in your fierce displeasure
8075109 against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness
8075110 so that they are without excuse because although they knew god they did not glorify him as god nor were thankful
8075111 have mercy on me o lord for i am weak o lord heal me for my bones are troubled my soul also is greatly troubled but you o lord how long return o lord deliver me oh save me for your mercies sake
8075112 for in death there is no memory of you in the grave who will give you thanks
8075113 my eye wastes away because of grief it grows old because of all my enemies depart from me all you workers of iniquity let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled
8075114 for the lord has heard my supplication the lord will receive my prayer

8075116 if your sons have sinned against him he has cast them away for their transgression
8075117 if you would earnestly seek god and make your supplication to the almighty if you were pure and upright surely now he would awake for you and prosper your rightful dwelling place though your beginning was small yet your latter end would increase abundantly he will yet fill your mouth with laughing and your lips with rejoicing
8075118 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god

8075205 o mcdonalds diz que est firme e ap ia nosso povo que vive e trabalha numa sociedade livre de discrimina o e importuna o mas eis o que o mcdonalds n o dir para voc o mcdonalds ajudou a patrocinar a parada do orgulho gay de san francisco
8075206 o mcdonalds tem orgulho de nossa for a de trabalho variada e do fato de que o grupo homossexual campanha pelos direitos humanos reconheceu o mcdonalds como uma empresa que demonstra ativamente seu compromisso para com gays e l sbicas
8075207 a empresa recusou declarando que continuar a apoiar a agenda gay inclusive o casamento homossexual a aaf pede um boicote s lanchonetes mcdonalds
8075208 esse boicote n o envolve oposi o ao direito de empregar funcion rios homossexuais nem no modo como eles s o tratados envolve a escolha do mcdonalds de investir seus recursos para promover a agenda homossexual
8075209 se por acaso voc ap ia a defini o hist rica acerca do casamento que e sempre foi homem e mulher ent o voc um provocador de dio e inimizade
8075210 donos de empresas crist os e outros com valores tradicionais seriam for ados sob penas legais a abandonar convic es religiosas e adotar a pr pria perspectiva secular humanista e relativista moral do mcdonalds do que certo e errado em muitos casos os donos de empresas seriam perseguidos mesmo que sua empresa em quest o fosse expressamente religiosa
8075211 essa lei joga o governo diretamente contra a livre express o religiosa e por esse motivo inconstitucional de cara
8075212 o mcdonalds est agora publicamente apoiando o casamento homossexual que um casamento falsificado apesar do fato de que de acordo com uma pesquisa de opini o p blica feita em mar o de 2007 pela tv cbs e pelo jornal new york times s 28 por cento dos americanos cr em que pares homossexuais devem ter permiss o de se casar legalmente
8075213 o casamento o alicerce fundamental de qualquer sociedade saud vel se algu m introduz dinheiro falsificado no mercado o d lar desvalorizado se algu m introduz o casamento falsificado na sociedade o casamento verdadeiro desvalorizado e a sociedade prejudicada
8075214 contudo o mcdonalds est jogando todo o seu peso marca comercial e reputa o para promover o casamento gay nos eua

8075234 in the sad reality of enabling emotional trauma and delusion that comprises their stock in trade
8075235 it is not a joking matter to wonder if the triangle foundations wardrobe instructions will further traumatize or inhibit the emotionally disturbed men who claim theyre really women who had every serious intent of wearing a dress to the state capitol and using the womens restrooms while theyre there is the triangle foundation asking lobbying day participants to go back into the closet for mere political expedience
8075236 theres no dress code for our lobby day weve had people with mohawks and people in jeans and t shirts its come as you are this is the politics of distraction thats why they bring up cross dressing and womens restrooms the afam isnt a pro family organization theyre a hate group

8075275 el accidente de barajas era inevitable por la mala gesti n gubernamental ante la crisis econ mica y por el relativismo moral del gobierno
8075276 no acostumbro a responder a lo que considero que forma parte de la esencia de libertad que se respira en internet es decir a los debates que noticias art culos y otros modos de expresi n period stica generan en la red por m s que a veces estos puedan ser subidos de tono pero cuando se traiciona la confianza que este peri dico ha depositado en sus lectores poniendo en manos de su sentido com n la l gica autocensura y bajo el amparo del anonimato m s cobarde se superan los l mites de lo tolerable en lo que a insultos e improperios se refiere demostrando un comportamiento ruin y censurable por parte de aquellos que siendo una minor a averg enzan al resto de la familia de lectores de el confidencial creo que no me queda m s remedio que defenderme de lo que no es sino una muestra desproporcionada del cinismo y la hipocres a con la que habitualmente act a la izquierda esta vez llevados al extremo de los insultos y las descalificaciones m s sangrantes y dolientes
8075277 no deja de ser curioso que los mismos que este fin de semana se rasgaban las vestiduras cual fariseos hip critas por un art culo en el que en ning n caso se culpaba al gobierno de un accidente pero s se afirmaba y ahora volver a reiterar esos argumentos que se han favorecido las condiciones objetivas para que ocurriera fueran los mismos que hace poco m s de cuatro a os sal an a la calle a llamar asesino al presidente aznar y portaban pancartas con las fotograf as de destacados diputados del pp se al ndolos tambi n como autores de un crimen execrable o intentaban linchar a rodrigo rato y a josep piqu en barcelona todo ello a cuenta de los atentados terroristas del 11 de marzo de 2004 en nuestro pa s y ahora se ponen de los nervios porque la gesti n deleznable de rodr guez durante la pasada legislatura y lo que va de esta se ha visto empa ada te ida por la tragedia de un accidente que seguramente hubiera podido evitarse en circunstancias muy distintas a estas
8075278 obviamente ni aznar era culpable de aquellos atentados ni rodr guez lo es de un accidente que ha costado la vida a 154 personas pero es evidente que aquellos atentados de madrid no hubieran tenido lugar de no haber mediado la decisi n pol tica de situar a nuestro pa s en el bando norteamericano en la guerra de iraq es decir se daban las condiciones objetivas para que ese atentado tuviera lugar igual que ahora rodr guez ha creado las condiciones objetivas para que el accidente de barajas fuera posible es esto culparle del accidente no es culparle de dejaci n de funciones quienes leyeran el domingo la portada de el mundo tendr n ya motivos m s que suficientes para hacer ese juicio de valor fomento ha actuado con una enorme irresponsabilidad y su titular deber a responder por ello y dimitir de su cargo hay un precedente el caso de air madrid err neamente el fin de semana confund esta compa a con air europa que pudo haber acabado tambi n en tragedia soy un loco por decir esto o m s bien es que he puesto el dedo en la llaga de la verdad y por eso la izquierda se ha soliviantado hasta el punto en que lo ha hecho
8075279 en mi an lisis del fin de semana me limit a exponer unos hechos contrastables en ning n caso me he atrevido a se alar ni remotamente cuales pueden haber sido las causas del accidente rodr guez por su parte tras haber visionado un v deo de la tragedia se ha permitido el lujo de dar su opini n sobre los hechos y de hacerlo p blicamente debe ser gracias a su dilatada experiencia como piloto de aviones y al elevado n mero de horas de vuelo acumuladas en su curr culum por lo que se puede aventurar a sacar conclusiones premeditadas y a asegurar lo obvio que se investigar hasta el final pero el imb cil soy yo manda huevos que dir a trillo esto se ores y se oras m os no es m s que la evidencia de que la izquierda utiliza una doble vara de medir seg n sea ella la que comete los desaguisados o sea la derecha con una obvia ventaja de parte esta izquierda es c nica e hip crita a m s no poder y lo ocurrido el fin de semana entorno a mi opini n sobre el accidente de barajas no es m s que la demostraci n de lo que vengo denunciando desde hace tiempo la izquierda no admite la libertad de expresi n la combate con todas sus armas el insulto y la descalificaci n entre ellas con tal de acallar las voces cr ticas

8075370 cest une r volution cest une r volution orange les fran ais ont d cid quils allaient se faire respecter
8075371 nicolas sarkozy a transform le minist re de lint rieur en commissariat central et notre proposition est que jacques chirac y rentre car il y a des juges qui lattendent
8075372 ecartons les tactiques politiciennes votons pour nous allons droit au but votons pour donner une boussole la gauche cette boussole cest le parti communiste fran ais les sondages on peut les faire mentir

8075379 les dangers qui p sent sur notre pays cause de la situation de la s curit
8075380 sarkozy est juif par sa m re cela joue un peu en sa faveur
8075381 sarkozy est toujours en faveur des organisations juives et disra l il est pro am ricain tr s pro am ricain mais tous les juifs ne sont pas pour lui il a galement permis limmigration de centaines de milliers de personnes venant dafrique et dafrique musulmane
8075382 je nai pas ni la shoah je nai fait que dire tout simplement que les chambres gaz ne constituent quun d tail dans lhistoire de la deuxi me guerre mondiale ce nest pas quelque chose qui aurait du provoquer la col re

8075388 son exp rience de lexercice du pouvoir et sa capacit de faire avancer les choses
8075389 val ry giscard destaing a dirig la france pendant sept ans jacques chirac a dirig la france pendant douze ans que deux hommes de cette envergure et de cette qualit quels que soient par ailleurs les d saccords que jai pu avoir avec eux disent voil on a regard tous les candidats et celui qui nous para t le mieux m me de conduire la france pour les cinq ann es qui viennent cest celui ci cest important
8075390 que les choses soient bien claires il ny a pas dans la strat gie du ps et pas davantage dans la mienne dalliance entre ces partis
8075391 cest flatteur et gentil de sa part une fois de consid rer quil me trouve quelques qualit s cela devient un peu ridicule lorsque r p tition laxe de sa campagne consiste vouloir sapproprier des hommes dont la ligne politique na jamais t la m me que la sienne
8075392 il nest pas trop tard m me si le message a du mal passer
8075393 je suis pour que lon continue un mouvement qui rassemble des gens dhorizons vari s
8075394 pour les l gislatives il y aura les m mes discussions et les m mes l ments politiques prendre en compte que pour les lections pr sidentielles
8075395 je veux prendre bras le corps le probl me du ch mage des jeunes dabord pour les jeunes et les adultes qualifi s qui nont pas de travail je veux mettre en place les emplois tremplins que jai d j exp riment s dans ma r gion on prend en charge six mois de salaires et de charges dun jeune dipl m qui aujourdhui les entreprises ne font pas confiance ensuite pour les jeunes qui sont sortis du syst me scolaire sans qualification je mettrai en place le contrat premi re chance je vais aussi aider les pme qui embauchent ces jeunes en all geant le co t du travail mais en contrepartie je leur demande de faire des contrats dur e ind termin e on nest pas du tout dans la logique du cpe qui permettait aux entreprises de licencier les jeunes sans justification avec le contrat premi re chance les jeunes vont avoir un tutorat tre accompagn s avec des formations adapt es
8075396 nicolas sarkozy qui navait somme toute quun grand parent fran ais nest peut tre pas le mieux qualifi pour incarner la france et le peuple fran ais comme doit le faire le pr sident de la r publique
8075397 je ne conteste pas la qualit de fran ais de monsieur sarkozy ni dailleurs des gens qui sont devenus fran ais par naturalisation mais ils ne peuvent pas tous tre pr sidents de la r publique le pr sident de la r publique mes yeux cest autre chose le pr sident de la r publique cest un personnage particulier qui a une fonction dincarnation qui me para t exiger des conditions suppl mentaires
8075398 je suis peu pr s certain quun grand changement va intervenir
8075399 dimanche prochain va se cr er un paysage politique tr s nouveau 85 des fran ais veulent que ce monde politique en cong lation bouge cest pour cela que ce mouvement de changement est en cours
8075400 cest parce que nous avons fait une campagne lectorale honorable sans faire de promesses mensong res en tirant la conscience des citoyens vers le haut que nous pourrons diriger ce pays en ayant la confiance lestime et ladh sion
8075401 il ny a aucune raison quon reste bloqu sur une strat gie de leuro fort qui p nalise nos exportations et qui loigne tant de fran ais exasp r s dune monnaie unique qui pour autant est une bonne chose
8075402 je ne comprends pas quon ait construit la deuxi me monnaie du monde et quon ne veuille pas la mettre au service de la croissance et de lemploi les anglais le font avec la livre les am ricains le font avec le dollar les japonais le font avec le yen les chinois le font avec le yuan
8075403 je ne suis pas dans le business institutionnel je ne suis pas un politicien professionnel je suis comme les militants de mon parti on sengage sur la base de notre temps libre le reste du temps on travaille si je ne passe pas
8075404 ce qui est un cas de figure possible je reprendrai le travail mercredi prochain
8075405 le ps doit se mettre dans la t te quil ne pourra pas gagner tout seul
8075406 il y aura un d bat dans le parti bien videmment mais je ne pense pas quil devra profond ment changer de strat gie
8075407 des verts 1 ce sera le r acteur epr des incin rateurs partout des ogm en plein champ pas dargent pour les nergies renouvelables mais beaucoup pour les autoroutes
8075408 on doit affronter la r volution cologique et les effets du r chauffement climatique ce nest pas un probl me technique mais une question de civilisation de changement dimaginaire
8075409 on a pu penser au moment du d bat sur le pacte cologique de nicolas hulot quils avaient pris conscience de la r alit des probl mes la d monstration est faite que non que reste t il dans les discours et les propositions concr tes deux mois apr s rien
8075410 vous voulez le changement vous ne le regretterez pas car le changement paisible harmonieux la force tranquille elle est l devant vous
8075411 seules les id es de gauche et de progr s o les valeurs humaines vont lemporter sur les valeurs boursi res et financi res permettront la france de se redresser je ferai les r formes parce que je suis une femme libre je ne d pends daucune puissance dargent daucun lobby je nai personne placer je nai que vous

8075414 dispositif sp cial pour les victimes la gratuit des soins aux victimes et leurs proches aussi longtemps que n cessaire
8075415 je trouve aberrant quen pleine campagne lectorale le gouvernement sorte un d cret pour construire une nouvelle centrale nucl aire flamanville cest un d ni de d mocratie cest prendre les citoyens pour des objets
8075416 ils seront peut tre capables de construire leurs pyl nes mais ils ne pourront pas laisser en permanence deux cents crs derri re chaque pyl ne
8075417 cela fait trente ans que je combats le tout nucl aire ce que je propose pour les questions cologistes cest quon se donne le temps du d bat et quon lance quatre moratoires sur lepr les ogm les incin rateurs et les modes de transport il faudrait aussi repenser notre mode de d veloppement des campagnes qui ne doivent pas devenir des zones pour touristes ou pour stocker nos d chets
8075418 un certain nombre de gens lorsque le g n ral de gaulle tait candidat d filaient avec des pancartes o il tait crit le fascisme ne passera pas ces gens ont disparu le g n ral de gaulle a t lu le ridicule ne les a pas tu s lorsque fran ois mitterrand a t lu une partie de la droite expliquait que les chars sovi tiques seraient sur la place de la concorde que fran ois mitterrand inqui tait ces gens ont disparu le ridicule ne les a pas tu s lorsque jacques chirac a t candidat on parlait de lui comme une personnalit mena ante
8075419 dans le fond tout a est bon signe cest peut tre le favori quon d signe comme a parce quon na pas autre chose dire
8075420 il ny a aucun accord dalliance imaginable dans une lection pr sidentielle avant le scrutin
8075421 a l lection pr sidentielle chacun des candidats se pr sente avec un projet et une id e de majorit nicolas sarkozy veut une majorit de droite tr s droite s gol ne royal veut sa r ponse rocard et kouchner la montr une majorit de gauche en tout cas elle pense quelle ne peut pas faire autrement moi je veux cette majorit nouvelle capable de faire travailler ensemble des gens de gauche et de droite r publicaine et de gagner
8075422 quel est le seul candidat qui devance nicolas sarkozy dans tous les sondages de second tour quel est le seul candidat qui va faire bouger les lignes cest parce que je r unis ces deux assurances que je serai dimanche prochain le vote utile
8075423 vous navez pas per u la formidable col re des fran ais pill s ruin s d sesp r s contre la racaille politicienne dont vous tes un des chefs et un des embl mes vous navez quune nationalit m sarkozy cest la nationalit sarkozienne
8075424 non m sarkozy le monde ne tourne pas autour de votre petite personne bien avant que vos parents ne viennent de hongrie et de gr ce il y a toujours eu au sein du peuple fran ais un courant national plus pr occup de lavenir et de lint r t du pays que de la personne des dirigeants le sang fran ais que vous m prisez il a coul beaucoup pour d fendre la libert et lind pendance de la france
8075425 une autre possibilit que de sabstenir ou de voter pour le fn
8075426 ce que que jessaie de faire cest de madresser tous les fran ais sans aucune exception la majorit silencieuse jesp re que cest celle qui va sexprimer dimanche cest celle qui pense quon doit parler de lidentit de la france et de limmigration qui pense quil y a un probl me de pouvoir dachat quil faut une nouvelle quipe
8075427 je veux leur dire quil y a une autre possibilit que de sabstenir ou de voter pour le front national
8075428 au premier tour il faut avertir s gol ne royal que si elle est lue elle na pas un ch que en blanc
8075429 je nai jamais cru que la gauche au pouvoir serait capable de prendre des mesures efficaces pour arr ter la d gradation des conditions dexistence des travailleurs
8075430 en votant pour ma candidature vous voterez bien s r contre sarkozy et tout ce quil repr sente de soumission au grand patronat
8075431 je veux que la france retrouve la ma trise de son destin
8075432 le patriotisme est la seule doctrine politique la seule r ponse aux grandes erreurs qui ont fait tant de mal notre pays
8075433 moi je dis au peuple fran ais r veillez vous criez votre col re dites ces politiciens de carri re qui mentent aux lecteurs rendez nous le pouvoir
8075434 si je suis lu je serai le pr sident dun renouveau des rep res civiques moraux et familiaux et je sortirai la france de la repentance
8075435 je veux rassembler toute la gauche au premier tour parce que si je rassemble toute la gauche les fran ais auront droit un vrai choix pour le second tour
8075436 je voudrais madresser aux femmes jai besoin du vote des femmes on me dit que pour certaines femmes cest trop r volutionnaire que de voir letat et la nation incarn s par une femme
8075437 je ne suis pas dans une manoeuvre politicienne je ne lai jamais t et je nimagine pas que michel rocard y soit lui qui a plus apport la france et aux id es que tous ses d tracteurs r unis
8075438 pour la premi re fois depuis trente ans le parti de fran ois bayrou ne r cuse pas la gauche r formatrice saisissons cette chance
8075439 jai suffisamment soutenu s gol ne royal et travaill avec elle pour savoir quelle peut orchestrer calmement cette indispensable mutation
8075440 les lecteurs de dimanche prochain ne sont pas prisonniers des fronti res du sectarisme la france vaut mieux que nos certitudes vieillies et nos crampes partisanes
8075441 on accumule de plus en plus de d clarations de nicolas sarkozy sur lidentit nationale linn et leug nisme

8075445 jai vu que deux candidats la pr sidentielle ndlr fran ois bayrou et s gol ne royal voulaient boycotter les jeux olympiques de chine eh bien il ne manquerait plus que cela des choses stupides dans ma vie jen ai entendues mais alors comme a champion olympique
8075446 le sport et ces v nements l cest plus important que tout parce que a fait partie du petit bonheur de la vie et quon na pas le droit de les sacrifier et quon na pas le droit de les abaisser
8075447 si vous devez tre confront cette situation jai confiance dans les mesures que vous prendrez sans d lai pour viter la diffusion au public de telles informations
8075448 seuls s gol ne royal olivier besancenot et fran ois bayrou ont sensiblement am lior leur note par rapport celle du 26 f vrier les autres candidats ont tr s peu fait voluer leur programme
8075449 pour la premi re fois les entreprises proposent une vision globale un projet de soci t coh rent avec un objectif augmenter la richesse de tous les fran ais

8075506 way to go pidge for highlighting such a riproaring exchange of opinion
8075507 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8075508 they gave voters a false choice between taxes and existing revenues and by offering that false choice and not leading with the ballot language it skewed the results
8075509 am i surprised at the numbers somewhat but it doesnt fall outside the bounds of what id be thinking

8075518 we ate lunch at the biergarten and interviewed cast members about their home country and gathered info from the menus shops any anything else we could find she also needed audio visual aids so we bought a t shirt with the german flag on it and some cookies made in germany she wore the t shirt and passed out cookies to the class we also picked up an epcot guide map written in german to use in her presentation
8075519 we suggest a temporary tutor or relative who can catch up the child if they do take the work with them and complete it and come back with a question thats great well help but many many vacationing kids who take the work with them do not even start it much less complete it we gladly work with kids after school that have been out due to illness or other legitimate approved excused reason even though we are tremendous disney fans we dont approve of leaving school for a trip
8075520 many teachers are more than willing to work with you so that you can take a nice family vacation and also make it a learning experience
8075521 family time is an extremely rare commodity these days the times we spent at disney world are great memories for our family just spending together we now have two college graduates so i guess our disney trips did nothing to hurt their academic progress
8075522 her wonderful experience with us at disney far outweighed any loss from being in school during that week she still talks about her experiences every single time we get together life is about the memories we create with our loved ones
8075523 safety first we know youre on vacation and we want you to have fun

8075528 its a ride thats a game its a game thats a ride
8075529 its fun for the entire family toy story midway mania joins an impressive lineup of new experiences here at disneys hollywood studios
8075530 obviously we wanted to make sure that everyone can ride this ride as comfortably as possible
8075531 we made sure that this ride could engage as many guests as possible thats something that were passionate about and
8075532 did you notice that the monitors onboard the vehicles have closed captioning
8075533 in this ride we use all these new tools along with our usual 3 d and 4 d tricks but weve incorporated them in a way to further the storytelling at disney we love to tell stories in a seamless way storytelling is the imperative
8075534 what we have started in pixar place is going to resonate with people for a long time
8075535 the park has added block party bash the new playhouse disney new high school musical show these things are all less than a year old now we have a new toy for everyone no pun intended

8075544 spending 7 hours walking up and down main street in complete silence or standing in one spot hoping that the kids in the family of four walking towards me werent about to have a loud screaming meltdown was a pretty unique experience

8075552 gosh id listen to public radio if only people my age were hosting the shows

8075567 as with 10 finger typing half qwerty presents a risk for developing repetitive strain injury rsi due to the continuous use of just one hand and the awkward hand positions required to make many key combinations it is suggested that the risk is even greater with this one handed method therefore this would not be a safe method for someone who has a history of rsi and or someone who has a lot of typing to do at one time if a fast typing rate is important to your client there may be other access methods that will allow for faster typing speeds for example voice recognition

8075587 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
8075588 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
8075589 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
8075590 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 34 celsius and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
8075591 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
8075592 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
8075593 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
8075594 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
8075595 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
8075596 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images

8075617 we were leery about if we could get it or not because it s so competitive
8075618 we applied primarily because we want to try to provide as many alcohol prevention programs as possible for our kids here at capital
8075619 one of the reason we were successful in getting it is because we have the dover caring community coalition that includes significant people who are part of it
8075620 they have the stakeholders in the community who have sanction over what we re doing and a good understanding of the problem and the risk and protective factors
8075621 this is for prevention so that we will not have a big alcohol and substance abuse problem
8075622 so our kids will have additional support to do the right thing
8075623 the monies are for a comprehensive approach to preventing substance abuse and other things that are correlations
8075624 this provides us with the opportunity to institute programming in the school and the community as well

8075692 its always been a mystery to us how they find their way back to a suitable habitat

8075696 if were managing coral reefs we need to integrate that management with the surrounding forests
8075697 if you chop down all the rainforest and planted melaleuca my feeling is that they wouldnt be able to find those islands anymore
8075698 reefs with islands on them should be targeted by reef management because they become places that people use and theres usually a limited land area on islands which quite often is modified

8075797 our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of palau were of normal stature and it counters the evidence that berger et al presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early palau
8075798 our research from whole bones and whole skeletons indicates that the earliest individuals in palau were of normal stature but gracile in other words they were thin
8075799 i think bergers primary mistakes were his not understanding the variation in the skeletal population in which he was working using fragmentary remains again in a situation where he didnt understand variation and stepping outside his own area of expertise which i think all scientists try not to do but sometimes we do
8075800 although we have not seen the material that berger et al base their results on we can speak to the diversity and normalcy of human skeletal series from throughout the archipelago that have been excavated from several burial caves over the last decade as well as the an abundance of archaeological linguistic and historical data indicating a general continuity of cultural traits over a period of three millennia
8075801 archaeological data also do not suggest a separate isolated group evolving differently biologically or culturally although there are subtle differences and changes that occur through time
8075802 had bergers team compared their scant dental metric data with those of other regions in the pacific or elsewhere in the world they would have seen that large teeth are not uncommon in early peoples of these regions
8075803 he did not take the time to understand the area in which he was working its entire history not just the skeletal stuff
8075804 any time you work anywhere you have to understand this history you just cant walk in and cowboy it pull some stuff out and draw conclusions in the absence of understanding the bigger picture

8075862 a stated overarching purpose for the said proposal to place a marine monument in cnmi waters is to urgently help create a blue legacy or president bush prior to his lame duck departure from office in january 2009 another purpose heralded for the venture is to reap credence and credibility to the ocean legacy project of the pew charitable trusts
8075863 the non partisan unified opposition of the cnmi populace to the monument proposal is clear through oral statements in the cnmis two native languages of carolinian and chamorro and through written statements in english cnmi elected leaders have said eghe ahi and no way jorge respectively what is there about no in three different languages that monument proponents do not understand and refuse to respect
8075864 the common denominator shared by the cnmi and these opposition groups is the reality that the designation process is a unilateral arbitrary presidential action that eschews weighing stakeholder concerns in a fair manner furthermore designation is a permanent action that is unlikely to be reversed by a subsequent u s congress even if the monument is later discovered to be ill designed and non functional and worse yet the imminent designation of the said monument merely hinges on an artificial and unrealistic political heritage deadline of january 2009 not on ecological and marine conservation concerns
8075865 we are investigating a matter which relates to a police officer and were still investigating
8075866 we had concerns about his behaviour and weve then looked to investigate that matter
8075867 so at the moment were still collecting evidence and well talk with the director of public prosecutions about the way we might go forward
8075868 were not about to investigate matters that are frivolous or dont have substance to them
8075869 what people need to understand is that police officers do have discretion many officers exercise that discretion in a number of ways
8075870 what we require of our officers when they do that though is that they are open and transparent
8075871 we have a variety of ways we conduct investigations were comfortable with the way we are investigating that
8075872 theres a whole variety of ways we find out about officers behaving badly our ethical standards department does an outstanding job
8075873 these people are considered dangerous and could possibly be armed so we are asking the public please do not approach them
8075874 well have to look at the entire communications process in light of this escape
8075875 in the future well release to the media at the same time we release to the rcmp to ensure that public safety is maintained

8075882 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8075883 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8075884 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8075885 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8075886 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8075887 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8075888 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8075889 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8075890 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play

8075899 he proceeded to give his opinion on how he felt that marriage gay marriage shouldnt be called a marriage because its a religious based word and hes a christian and theres no way that marriage could be considered legal in the gay sense
8075900 it is reprehensible that anyone would be subjected to religiously motivated bias when trying to care for their health
8075901 the fear of receiving this kind of discrimination and harassment from medical professionals keeps members of the gay lesbian bi sexual and transgender community from receiving the comprehensive and compassionate medical attention that every human being deserves
8075902 we have begun a thorough investigation of this matter we will review all aspects of this issue once this is complete we will take appropriate action
8075903 spectrum health has a zero tolerance policy regarding harassment for any discriminatory reason such as sex pregnancy race color national origin disability age religion sexual orientation marital status height weight or any other protected category such harassment is strictly prohibited intent or lack of intent to harass is not the determining factor in deciding whether this policy has been violated appropriate corrective action will be taken against any individual who violates this policy

8075947 this aids study was it seems the beginning of many years of research being carried out on me without my knowledge or consent
8075948 if as the ethics application form states consent was obtained from all subjects how is it that i did not know about my aids status until 1987

8075955 i am not talking to anyone now at all i am fully focussed on this years championship and i am not worried about next year

8075958 i left ferrari because i didnt have the freedom to do what i wanted to do i have that at honda but i still have not had the car to perform and i am waiting for that chance
8075959 what can i say but honestly the day that i feel that i am slower than my first race is the day i will call it off and stop the conversations are there and i am talking to the team i am talking to all the teams i want to be racing
8075960 im not worried in a way its good the team are talking to someone like alonso who has a lot of experience and with good teams
8075961 they are going to talk to other drivers thats only natural but im very happy with my position within the team rubens is a team mate i think he is fantastic has done a great job and he gives excellent feedback probably better than any other driver out there
8075962 so im sure whatever the teams decision is and if they are talking to him then it will be a very difficult decision for the team to make

8075998 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma

8076009 ive not sat down with him pointedly to get down to business just yet but i feel very comfortable working within the framework that he envisions hes got a good feel on the pulse and im very interested in what he might have in mind

8076012 it was just me kickin back and having a good time
8076013 we did everything from a jimmy reed take off things just keeping that bluesy thread throughout i think that as long as we maintain that blues tradition the material takes on an identity thats easily digestible at least in terms of what our fans have asked for
8076014 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year

8076024 if woolworths appeal to the supreme court is successful and woolworths is granted a clearance foodstuffs will also face no competition issues if it decides to purchase further shares in the warehouse
8076025 if woolworths appeal is unsuccessful again both companies are in the same position

8076027 we will await with interest the outcome of the woolworths appeal and as we have consistently said we would not rule anything in or anything out going forward

8076032 the central bankers of the world gathered last weekend for their annual meeting at jackson hole wyoming this was an opportunity to talk about the major issues confronting the world economy as well as an opportunity to spend some time in a very beautiful vacation spot
8076033 the next shock is going to be bigger and bigger still
8076034 the shocks keep getting bigger because we keep propping things up and bailing everyone out
8076035 i started dancing since 3rd grade i always loved to dance and when i heard that sm entertainment was holding auditions i rushed to go try out i was lucky and got casted even now whenever i have time im always watching dance videos to learn new moves
8076036 as soon as i entered high school i felt that i really wanted to sing i fell in love with music people around me also kept telling me that i sing pretty well so i decided that i wanted to become a singer and enlisted in the sm academy from there i was casted and am now a part of shinee
8076037 i was road casted by chance even as a child i always loved preforming for others so when i was casted by luck i was extremely happy
8076038 ever since middle school i was actively involved in various bands and performed at many competitions to further my skills luckily at one of the competitions an sm entertainment representative was watching and i got casted
8076039 when we first met and were under training we didnt really talk much to each other we were all very young and we even got into a couple fights with each other but we think thats pretty normal for all trainees

8076042 the discussions last week were robust and constructive and we look forward to continuing this dialogue around a revised draft exemption text at next months meeting
8076043 the key function of the nsg is to formulate guidelines for managing exports of nuclear material equipment and technology to ensure that this trade does not contribute to nuclear weapons proliferation
8076044 while new zealand remains a strong advocate of the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt and the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty ctbt and would welcome indias accession to these treaties we have not included these elements in our package of proposals
8076045 while noting concerns and the need for consistency in pursuing the objective of non proliferation
8076046 a large number of countries big and small expressed views similar to new zealands that there needed to be compatibility between the us india agreement and the goals of the nsg and indicated a willingness to engage positively to achieve that outcome
8076047 the nsg exemption should be clean and there should be no additional condition
8076048 they may want to push but india cant be pushed civil nuclear cooperation is important but that doesnt mean at any cost
8076049 should we allow ourselves to be pushed are we not indians are you not proud of yourself and what you are doing
8076050 all the options are on the table it is a work in progress
8076051 no there isnt that has been the companys strength but it is also the weakness
8076052 ive got no real plans it is just doing the right thing by my colleagues and shareholders
8076053 it is quite extraordinary to look back but everything has a beginning and an end
8076054 once that group disbands then gpg as one knows it would cease to exist
8076055 it is better to plan these things on a rational basis rather than be confronted by unforeseen circumstances nothing remains the same forever
8076056 taking into account all the facts and circumstances it is inequitable to hold the individual liable

8076075 i start with the recognition that we are at war and that war is not simply a hot debate between the capitalist camp and the socialist camp over which economic political social arrangement will have hegemony in the world

8076079 for women and men of rage amp reason a cinematic poetic and musical journey from victim to survivor and activist in the international movements to end violence against women
8076080 no is a thoughtful and thought provoking documentary that powerfully expresses the complexities of sexual violence within the black community no prompts viewers to question longheld assumptions about womens experiences of and responses to sexual violence but then moves beyond that to explicitly challenge viewers to take action and break the silence that has allowed sexual violence to devastate individuals and communities watching this excellent documentary is a powerful and somewhat painful experience but one that ultimately leaves viewers informed and empowered i selected no as a featured film for the 2008 association for women in psychology film festival because of its focus on women social justice and activism because its an outstanding film and because i knew that it would have a powerful impact on the audience people are still talking about it
8076081 in order to cool the body you must cool the blood
8076082 why dont we see many if any cars with rear wheel steering
8076083 no a documentary about rape and sexual assault screened and discussed at brown memorial baptist church
8076084 as a survivor of rape myself i found no to be very powerful and thought provoking i am truly blessed to have been able to see a screening of this film and meet the wonderful woman that made this film possible
8076085 no man who watches this film men with sisters daughters mothers lovers can leave not feeling a greater sense of responsibility to confront this issue
8076086 aishah shahidah simmons political and artistic approach which questions at the same time the oppression of race sex gender and class seems relevant to make visible at all levels and mainly in the african american community the violence against black women lesbians and girls
8076087 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8076088 candidates ask voters to stand up for them by donating money volunteering voting now its time for candidates to commit to standing for voters
8076089 signing the standing for voters pledge is a clear way to tell voters that care that all votes are counted and counted accurately and that candidates will do everything in their power to ensure that the elections are held to the highest standards
8076090 here we another example on how to persuade your boss into giving you a good review
8076091 john mccain has been in washington for too long he is out of touch with working americans its time to bring change to washington
8076092 if mccain is the answer the question must be ridiculous
8076093 part of the promise of a glorious nation where anyone who works hard enough can make the most of their god given potential
8076094 there is only one question in this race which candidate offers the change we need to restore the promise of america
8076095 will bring us the same broken politics for four more years
8076096 a new letter has been sent to tom cruise business partner paula wagner and united artists in which we set out the facts of the case again and put a figure on the legal demands of our clients of 11 million
8076097 she knew among her own circle of friends that african americans among them had not had good opportunities for schooling had no reason to hope that they could rise in the world
8076098 well why didnt they have good opportunities betty who took their hope from them and whos still taking it from them now surely theres more at work here than the mere supposed absences of black male role models isnt there
8076099 we organized we marched i was a public television producer and did shows with black activists it wasnt a particularly dangerous or strenuous effort but we were optimistic not anymore today what do many black kids get a chip on their shoulders and nothing but a long list of grievances black politicians insist on their martin luther king and rosa parks boulevards but ignore those black kids or defend them when they mess up
8076100 my mother turned twenty one then the age required for voting in 1928 and she voted for herbert hoover not because she agreed with him but because he was not catholic shocked by her mistake as the depression unfolded she vowed never again to consider religion or any other such factor when casting her vote without the new deals social security she and my father in old age would have faced dire poverty without the great societys medicare they could never have afforded medical care that allowed each to live past age ninety without the civil rights movement and legislation passed under president lbjs leadership she would have grieved that african americans were denied a life of dignity
8076101 deploying femtocells requires a good understanding of market segmentation of both mobile consumer and household markets meticulous planning and targeted marketing campaigns which mean operators will have to invest substantial amount of money if they want femtocell services to gain popularity
8076102 in addition if femtocells are sold to customers in sporadic fashion via traditional mobile operators channels then this may induce a huge scattering of femtocell deployment over large areas not only will this make it hard to manage faps and related networks but most importantly this would mean the operator will not be able to make any capex or opex savings
8076103 to go after productive citizens who have been our neighbors and friends for years its insane
8076104 i have seen a lot of documentaries about sexual violence in my 15 years as a film programmer and no
8076105 in the spring of 2006 the national sexual violence resource center selected aishah shahidah simmons documentary producer as the
8076106 mon colocataire y a tr s bien v cu pendant deux ans
8076107 heartbreaking personal and ultimately empowering no is a painstaking compilation of black womens testimonies about sexual assault and domestic violence not only does simmons goundbreaking film breaks a pervasive deadly silence it reaffirms the power of a black womans truth
8076108 no is a film about horrific crimes perpetuated against black women and girls no should be mandatory viewing for every black boy and black man in america
8076109 simmons exposes the crisis of sexual violence within african american communities and investigates the cultural forces that pushed b lack woman and girls into decades of collective silence
8076110 cosmic consciousness a study in the evolution of the human mind
8076111 mckeever delivers a powerhouse novel of desire deceit and murder the characters leap off the page to tell an intricate story of love that supersedes death the suspense is taut and becomes more tightly drawn as suspects are eliminated
8076112 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8076113 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8076114 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there
8076115 i really love my life now its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8076116 ive got a great home at fox now and i think its where i belong i wish i couldve had different news for giants fans but ive known for a while im done
8076117 why wasnt he on the wheaties box its a much healthier cereal with much less sugar
8076118 paint the white house black and im sure thats got em terrified mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed
8076119 it cant be about censorship but theyve gotta ask themselves is there anything mccain can turn around and use against the campaign no one wants to be the person who hurts the campaign
8076120 im confident that mccain and his boys will be pulling out the kitchen sink the sauna the tub and jacuzzi on barack people in power dont give up without a fight i know theyre excited this is one of the most historic moments in american politics its just not a done deal
8076121 obviously he cant associate himself with the misogynistic and derogatory lyrics
8076122 its up to the artists to support him in a more discreet way its more important for rappers to get people to go out and register to vote
8076123 bigger better closer and more aggressive than anything seen before
8076124 were going to pull out all the stops to make sure the voters can cut through the double talk and see john mccains promise of more of the same
8076125 more politics as usual does this look like change to you
8076126 i am hillary clinton and i do not approve this message
8076127 we need in the white house starting on january 20th barack obama and joe biden
8076128 still doesnt believe that women deserve equal pay for equal work
8076129 im not happy with obama and theres something about him that scares me
8076130 is not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8076131 shame on you barack obama enough with the speeches and the big rallies and then using tactics that are right out of karl roves playbook
8076132 senator obama holds up his original opposition to the war on the campaign trail but he didnt start working aggressively to end the war until he started running for president so when he had a chance to act on his speech he chose silence instead
8076133 last summer he basically threatened to bomb pakistan which i dont think was a particularly wise position to take
8076134 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8076135 well you know senator obama it is very difficult having a straight up debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote and that has been a pattern
8076136 if we dont have universal health care we will be betraying the democratic partys principles sen obamas plan does not and cannot cover all americans
8076137 but biden doesnt live in washington he takes the train in
8076138 clear insanity of voicing their feminist protest by voting for john mccain
8076139 many people say true friends are hard to find but i know im not that kind they come and go and sometimes leave us behind like a wind that passes by
8076140 in essence america has too many illegal immigrants and too few legal ones particularly those with unique entrepreneurial professional and scientific skills
8076141 in the end you have to be able to say do i really want to make this loan because i may have to eat it
8076142 do i really want to make this loan because i may have to eat it
8076143 over his head in this race leading up to arguably the most important american presidential election in the last 50 years
8076144 mama will you bring your camera here so i can take a picture
8076145 im not interested in chasing after little children people dont have to worry about me causing problems
8076146 i didnt have anything resembling a friend between third and 12th grade
8076147 its the tastes they develop in their kids the clothing and pursuits they pick for them
8076148 there are a lot of depressed cool kids and its better to be a happy nerd than a popular anorexic
8076149 they realize its hard and theyve been missing out on a lot
8076150 nerds focus on special interests and unusual topics usually to the exclusion of maintaining relationships and emotional life they have different agendas than others who tend to focus more on friendships relationships and social aspects of work
8076151 ive taken 30 second segments of soap operas with the sound off and said lets look at the tape and figure out what the people are feeling
8076152 a favorite exercise is evaluating the social skills of servers at ice cream shops
8076153 it gets the kid to think wow she seemed to have pretty bad eye contact but if you were the customer what could you do to make it go better
8076154 those pastimes allow socially quirky people to engage in parallel play
8076155 d amp d allows somebody whos in their own head to stay within that geeky world but have others nearby
8076156 even einstein occasionally wanted to connect with people and have sex
8076157 a bee fell out of my mind whats a mind
8076158 tried to find a picture in the encyclopedia of an animal attacking a person chewing him and leaving the bones
8076159 when not allowed to do something she screams in a piercing falsetto
8076160 i was often accused of not paying attention or of being on a different planet but i was actually paying close attention to something else
8076161 kiriana had many problems learning the square dances and musical games changing direction or actions at musical cues appeared to be quite difficult for her
8076162 the result was that they treated me like an alien
8076163 but i never really thought anything was wrong with her
8076164 every now and then id pass her in the hall but she was always working on something
8076165 i just wanted them not to talk to me so i pulled together as much blunt sarcasm as i could and established myself as a weird unfriendly girl
8076166 does everyone see hear smell taste and feel exactly the same thing when they perceive the same object
8076167 i have a really hard time feeling emotionally aroused brutal violent scary things were interesting to me because that was the best way to feel something
8076168 i was partly drawn to serial killers because of my interest in patterns logical induction and puzzle solving
8076169 these twisted individuals took puzzles to a whole new level of interest
8076170 i would ponder the logic instead of just using shortcut strategies
8076171 when i watch a movie i have to turn the volume way up to understand dialogue but way down whenever there is background noise or music
8076172 when i go to hear a lecture on a subject its like im listening to a foreign language
8076173 now that hes aware of that i can just run and get a pen and write it down
8076174 to me art is a part of science of finding the details that define an object
8076175 i dont feel lonely very often and when i do its usually not a general feeling of loneliness as much as a wish to be with a certain person or people
8076176 the things most people think of as fun are work to me
8076177 he was the only person i ever felt really connected to where i didnt mind if he hugged me
8076178 my parents try to be affectionate and they get hurt feelings sometimes because i dont like to hug them
8076179 but its usually out of anger or frustration rarely do i feel true sadness
8076180 there are so many situations where im talking to somebody and i can tell theyve lost interest
8076181 a lot of times im not sure what i did
8076182 i wish id been a dork or a nerd because those are things that people recognize
8076183 if i saw a person lying on the street my first response would be i wonder whats wrong with them i should call 911 its not emotional its practical
8076184 if i saw a dog lying on the street i would be on my knees in pain

8076188 i spend a lot of time watching the rats in the lab

8076194 never tell a potential client that their current logo sucks
8076195 in doing so you can almost guarantee that the client a family member of the client or the individual with whom you are dealing played a major role in creating the current image this seems to hold true whether the client is a one person home based business or a large corporation making such an insensitive introductory remark is not the best way to start the sometimes long collaborative process of putting the best new face on a clients business or organization
8076196 because its the summer youre not teaching and youre home with your son full time

8076199 with the eye of a poet and the rigor of a sociologist aishah shahidah simmons exposes an ugly reality of sexual violence this is cinematic activism at its finest as it is both a call to action and an expertly constructed documentary
8076200 this ground breaking work creates needed space to debate the issue of how violence against women harms black women and those who love them
8076201 given the level of violence against women in this country we owe it to ourselves and to future generations not to turn our backs on this film for in ignoring this film we would once again be ignoring the voices of women
8076202 the power of no lies not just in regaining lost voices but in re visioning and repositioning black womens history and current reality one of the strengths of the film is that it does not show the women broken they come across as whole human beings with agency and insight
8076203 no does not flinch and is a vital contribution to ongoing cultural political discussions not only in african america but also in the african diaspora and beyond
8076204 if the black community in the americas and in the world would save itself it must complete the work this film begins

8076237 i recommend this film to any community agency or institute of higher learning that understands the importance of social justice compassion and education
8076238 this audience record is something i thought id never see again but what really satisfied me is the way in which these olympics truly captivated and seemed to inspire our country
8076239 for me the greatest measure of success at an olympics is the number of messages i receive from parents of young kids who have fallen in love with the olympics that child means more to me than anything because i think a love affair with the olympics is the greatest in all of sports its a privilege to have this job because its one of the few ways in which you can still reach families and children in a meaningful way if you produce it the right way the entire family will watch together
8076240 everything we are doing is focused on long term sustainable profitability were focusing on product decisions and cost controls were trying to eliminate red tape and unnecessary expense

8076254 when you re train a battalion you have to refurbish the unit with equipment weapons ordinance supplies

8076267 requires the state and local government to put liability surrounding retiree benefits other than pensions on the bottom line for state of idaho that requires the medicare benefit
8076268 because of gasb 45 the intent of the legislation is to mitigate that dollar figure and lower it to under one hundred million
8076269 as time goes on we recognize cost goes up but certainly retirement funds dont go up
8076270 my husband worked for the state for 35 years and thats loyal didnt have overtime and made a lot lower wage but we were true blue idahoans
8076271 the promised us all these benefits when we got hired and we stayed with them through these hard times

8076293 every rotarian that we bring into our clubs helps to make dreams real
8076294 every single one is another pair of hands and another mind and another heart to do rotarys work
8076295 if we do not bring in younger members we will miss out on a great deal of energy and expertise
8076296 and we will not be training a new generation of members to become club presidents district governors and senior ri leaders in the years to come
8076297 there are many qualified professionals who may simply be overlooked because their professions are not typical for rotary members
8076298 we will make dreams real by giving children hope and a chance at a future
8076299 rotary started here it carries historical significance and continues our focus on the future
8076300 we reach a much broader audience and it broadens our sphere of influence to promote diversity

8076304 arshavins transfer story is taking too long it has already lasted six weeks and i wont deny it has had a negative impact on our team and our results as well

8076314 han demostrado que a pesar de las desinformaciones a pesar del temor que se nos ha querido infundir que el pueblo hondure o es valeroso luchador revolucionario
8076315 algunos medios de comunicaci n se prestan a estas confabulaciones se prestan a escuchar a los responsables de la pobreza

8076321 no one wants a deal with a corrupt regime that continues to rule over the most dangerous country in the world in which to be a trade unionist
8076322 will the land belong to the poor who have traditionally populated and cultivated it or to the multinational corporations
8076323 this bilateral free trade agreement will open up significant opportunities for canadian companies in this growing economy as well as elsewhere in the middle east and north africa
8076324 the marks you receive in the school of experience are mostly bruises
8076325 yes it is possible we have very significant experience we have negotiated with the united states that is as immense as china and this country has great opportunities
8076326 we also have to understand that china has certain interests that we must consider this is s a topic of negotiation
8076327 courage because in spite of the demonisation of alba he has not hesitated to join a latin american integration project based on the thinking and spirit of our foremost heroes
8076328 today we are signing not only a fraternal pact of solidarity but also an integration project for latin america that stands out as an alternative to imperial hegemony and integrates progressive governments that are proposing a way out of oppressive imperialism
8076329 abject hand lickers of the yanquis there are many of them here as in the rest of latin america where the chief pitiyanquis are the owners of the media
8076330 an act of freedom because we are a free and sovereign people
8076331 this is a heroic act of independence and we need no ones permission to sign this commitment today we are taking a step towards becoming a government of the centre left and if anyone dislikes this well just remove the word centre and keep the second one
8076332 so thank you president ch vez for opening ways to freedom for latin americans because we were not born to be slaves nor to have masters
8076333 when i met with u s president george w bush no one called me an anti imperialist and the business community applauded me now that i am meeting with the impoverished peoples of the world they criticise me i hope they will retract their statements in the coming hours
8076334 who has told them they have an absolute right to privatise i invite them to participate in dialogue and to sign a truly national pact with a vision for the country
8076335 if the right finances worse things why shouldnt we mobilise our people
8076336 they promised us a bonus of 300 lempiras 15 dollars per person but we cant find the politician who is supposed to pay us although we know he was given the money
8076337 the financial content of the alba pact is unknown to date no one will talk about it there is no information only political pronouncements but the people deserve to know what the country is letting itself in for in terms of debt and future prospects
8076338 the prime goal of honduras joining alba is that the government wants money in the short term but the needs of government seldom coincide with the needs of the people this creates a delicate situation because ultimately it is the people who pay for the inappropriate expenses incurred by a government
8076339 there has been much speculation about alba but the truth is its a good alliance for the country in due course the transparency measures will be made known not everything can be accomplished in one day its necessary to be patient
8076340 behold all souls are mine the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine the soul who sins will die

8076343 truly truly i say to you he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life
8076344 one thing you lack go and sell all you possess and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me
8076345 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might

8076374 the survey reflects the general uncertainty about the economic outlook the number of companies expecting to make redundancies has jumped but the majority still expect to employ the same or a higher number of staff in 12 months time

8076385 rotarys mission is to promote peace and world understanding whereas open worlds goal is to increase u s eurasian understanding and partnership we were a natural fit
8076386 i am particularly appreciative of the work she has done to make the open world program successful

8076394 one day in uganda we looked over and saw that one of our recipients was teaching another to tie his shoes
8076395 were looking for sustainability we want to get host countries involved
8076396 when you are looking at the quality of life of others around the world if you are going the walk the talk you are going to take risks

8076417 i continued to try a couple other things like checking if they eventually forgot some ports like 21 ftp or 110 pop3 but no all of them were properly blocked after a lot of unsuccesfull attempts i had some intuition telling me to check how they handle pictures without any hope of success i typed into my browsers adress bar and to my big surprise i saw the page you see when you follow the link right now the next thing i typed in was http www google com jpg but that didnt work but i went on and found that urls like worked like a charm i found that i could easily visit sites like slashdot google or even this weblog when adding a jpg at the end of the url the next logical step was to automate that i downloaded greasemonkey xpi jpg g and wrote a 4 line js script that would add jpg to every link in a document that way i was able to browse most sites without a hassle unfortunatly i didnt get to explore this vulnerbility much more because i had to board the airplane were i waited another 3 hours due to a mechanical failure without wlan

8076422 it will aid in the establishment of successful tai pure within new zealand which will mean an increase in the control and management of fisheries that increase will in turn lead to an increase in tino rangatiratanga which will have a flow on effect of improving identity and improved health and wellbeing
8076423 my work will eventually contribute to combating periodontal diseases among m ori and will also meet a national need to develop better and more objective forensic techniques to help combat family violence and abuse among m ori and pakeha

8076429 clearwire intends to build and maintain a network that will embrace important openness features
8076430 the new network will provide wireless consumers with real choices for the software applications content and handsets that they desire
8076431 but thats contingent on the timely close of the sprint merger and if we choose to secure interim financing
8076432 empowering live real broadband tv in the car is a unique capability of wimax we expect that our agreement with american wireless to provide clearwire service within voyager will accelerate deployment of wimax nationwide
8076433 in other words the pgp offers you to decode your genome for free there are obviously counterparts to that your data will be used by scientists to perform research on it

8076435 the federal government is hiring u s terrorism experts to deepen canadian soldiers understanding of how their taliban enemies think saying it needs to prepare troops better as they wage a counterinsurgency war in afghanistan
8076436 that it is bypassing the normal route for contracting and awarding the job to arlington va based terrorism research center on a sole source basis saying its the only firm capable of doing the job the one year contract has a maximum annual payout of 848 250 u s but may be extended
8076437 it is vital that soldiers have the training to understand the people whom they will assist and those that will pose a grave and present danger
8076438 we regret the loss of life among the innocent afghanis who we are committed to protect coalition forces take precautions to prevent the loss of civilians unlike the taliban and militants who target civilians and place civilians in harms way

8076443 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
8076444 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
8076445 call in sick today were flying to puerto rico for the weekend
8076446 the company needs to get serious about these issues or they are going to have a work stoppage on their hands
8076447 we need to share the success of the company with our employees but we also have to sustain that success into the future for everybodys benefit
8076448 the language they have proposed would significantly restrict our ability to react to market changes
8076449 the best way to ensure job stability which is what the iam is talking about is to improve productivity which will help us increase airplane sales

8076455 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
8076456 i ask all of you who worked so hard for me who knocked on doors and made those phone calls who got in arguments from time to time to work as hard for barack obama as you did for me
8076457 lets work our hearts out to elect barack obama and joe biden our next president and vice president
8076458 at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right and the status quo just wont cut it
8076459 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8076460 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans and democrats but first and foremost as americans
8076461 she will thank her supporters and lay out the case for why they need to support barack obama
8076462 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plan is the billions of dollars hes promising in tax cuts for oil companies and the only thing hell recycle is the same failed bush approach to energy policy
8076463 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home well in john mccains version theres no place like home and home and home and home
8076464 in kurdistan there is no freedom for journalists i have proof of that the most recent proof was soran
8076465 we dont know who killed him but we do know that the government didnt care
8076466 the recent incidents have really stripped off the veneer and revealed its not much different than other parts of iraq
8076467 in kurdistan there isnt really a political opposition so the government thinks that journalists are the opposition
8076468 the problem you know with our journalists they think they are free to say anything and do anything
8076469 a free and independent press will make an important contribution to democratic development
8076470 the pilot relayed to the airport head that the hijackers do not want any negotiations and they have only one demand that the plane be refuelled to go to paris
8076471 the hijackers also rejected the airport request that passengers who had fainted because of inadequate air conditioning in the plane be given medical treatment
8076472 they said they belong to slms abdel wahed nur who lives in paris they had coordinated with him to meet them in the french capital
8076473 we took no part in this hijacking at all it is completely against our aims values and objectives we condemn this hijacking with a strong voice
8076474 the pilot also informed the airport director that the hijackers numbered 10 before he came back to say their number could be more than that
8076475 we had three senior members on the plane and some other people they got on and someone hijacked it
8076476 about half an hour after takeoff a hijacker demanded to go to cairo as a destination
8076477 i cant handle this we have to go back to town
8076478 it looks like were slowly starting to dig out of this
8076479 it appears to be an internal software processing problem were going to have to do some forensics on it
8076480 i think the russians want to divert attention from georgia and annoy the americans
8076481 we hope its going to be adopted by the council

8076487 hmmph be a darn sight better day ifn your horse could pull this cart to market
8076488 oh ho no no can do grannie a horse like this one costs at least six thousand gold coins she is far too nice to pull a cart

8076490 well that is what im going to sell her for at yon market shes a good one she is i was lucky to find her in the dukes stables

8076494 theres these brass candle sticks i got from the chapel up the way ill sell them to you for a dozen gold coins each heres a shiny pebble i found on the ground i think it may be magic perhaps you could use it for jewelcrafting i found a squirrel dead on the road where a cart had crushed it so i have some squirrel eyes and a really nice squirrel tail for you what say a hundred gold coins for everything
8076495 duke ferds parade mare 4 sale has 4 legs tail teeth can be turned in for find the dukes stolen horse quest or split into parts 6000 gold obo pst

8076497 the only thing youre gonna lose is your head thats duke ferd coming up the road with his elite guard or im blind hell be wanting his horse back i think
8076498 loofug pissed thats ferd but he is most definitely pissed
8076499 back then we didnt have the internet and youtube you had to rely on people skills to introduce people in ohio to taiwan i used a lot of writing and slideshows and verbal explanation basic presentations no powerpoint just talking to people
8076500 i was introduced to several rotarians here in los angeles and i am going to start contacting them and see if there is a way i can give back
8076501 in the past rotary events were held in small circles and only a few members of the media would come now people blog and share information
8076502 right now i see new blood and new faces and a new way of doing things
8076503 we were looking for a project where we could build relationships
8076504 this was a great opportunity for us to make a lasting legacy
8076505 we outlined a multicountry strategy that identified haiti as one of five countries where we wished to make an impact
8076506 he was able to outline the strategy while i put together the grant
8076507 from the moment we set foot in port au prince to the second we boarded our returning flight i had the opportunity to meet haitians rotarians humanists and leaders from all walks of life
8076508 it was the sense of dignity pride and purpose that the people of matenwa shared with us that really stood out my life is forever changed as a result of this experience
8076509 he says hell play nicey nice with islamic militants who want to kill americans at home and abroad
8076510 le pauvre colporteur est mort la nuit derni re etc
8076511 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
8076512 i have in the last few months become more pessimistic than the consensus
8076513 im not someone who sees things in a bleak way
8076514 i have more concerns about potential risks and vulnerabilities than most people
8076515 its a mix of skills that rarely comes packaged in one person
8076516 im drawing on twenty years of accumulated experience using models
8076517 nouriel has a different way of seeing things than most economists he gets into everything
8076518 the most brilliant economist who never wrote down an equation
8076519 were in uncharted territory where standard economic theory isnt helpful
8076520 the justification for his bearish call has evolved over the years
8076521 this forecasting by analogy is a tempting thing to do
8076522 but you have to pick the right analogy the danger of this more subjective approach is that instead of letting the objective facts shape your views you will choose the facts that confirm your existing views
8076523 and youre asking whats the worst thing that could happen the first thing people will say is lets see what nouriel says
8076524 if the underlying conditions call for optimism nouriel would be optimistic
8076525 im not comfortable saying that were going to end up in the great depression
8076526 we are in a recession and denying it is nonsense
8076527 you either nationalize the banks or you nationalize the mortgages
8076528 reckless people have deluded themselves that this was a subprime crisis
8076529 but we have problems with credit card debt student loan debt auto loans commercial real estate loans home equity loans corporate debt and loans that financed leveraged buyouts
8076530 a good third of the regional banks wont make it
8076531 our biggest financiers are china russia and the gulf states
8076532 once you run current account deficits you depend on the kindness of strangers
8076533 this might be the beginning of the end of the american empire
8076534 why new york citys third try with tidal power is good news for the u s
8076535 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point cease fire agreement
8076536 in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized borders of georgia and they must remain so
8076537 i can assure you that these are purely humanitarian aid shipments that are going into georgia and nothing else
8076538 since the united states is a permanent member of the u n security council this simply will be dead on arrival in the security council
8076539 it is not in russias interest to have a nuclear armed nation on its border on the korean peninsula

8076558 the award has given me a great responsibility to do everything humanly possible to ensure that polio is finally and totally eradicated from nigeria
8076559 as an african and resident of kano i am honored to present this award to president yaradua
8076560 i thank him for the progress being made in reaching more nigerian children with the necessary vaccine
8076561 we got into specifics speaking to villagers understanding their sanitation and what solutions they wanted
8076562 the villagers came up with the solution they have six months of rainy season so the best thing would be to get water tanks
8076563 the fact that we can possibly eradicate a disease like typhoid in kabakaburi by supplying clean drinking water is fantastic the whole district became excited
8076564 going to the villages themselves and getting their input is extremely important maintaining the project is key
8076565 by doing this we are also spreading knowledge of rotary
8076566 the fema individual assistance program can help eligible applicants with temporary housing assistance uninsured personal property and medical dental and funeral expenses caused by the disaster and other serious unmet needs
8076567 low interest disaster loans from the u s small business administration are available to homeowners renters and businesses of all sizes in the designated counties
8076568 i am so sick of this and nothing is being done
8076569 i dont know i sort of felt like i should do something since praying didnt seem to be doing the trick
8076570 its only stuff and we can replace all the stuff we have im fine my animals are fine and im here to help the neighbors
8076571 we tell local governments all disasters are local but it is important that theyre not by themselves
8076572 once the county is declared for individual assistance we will put out that 1 800 621 fema number to people who registered thats important well send an inspector out to their home to determine how much damage theyre eligible for and then we will issue them a check right away sometimes it turns around within 24 hours
8076573 we expect within 24 hours this is my hope we request the president and others who have to act on that to act on that

8076576 un modelo de pa s no lo da el sistema econ mico sino el sistema educativo
8076577 las comunicaciones avanzan y transforman las relaciones en el planeta el progreso cient fico actual es apenas un comienzo
8076578 este proceso de cambio se basa en ideas y profesionales que lideren el mismo la universidad tuvo y tendr profundas transformaciones
8076579 siguiendo lo expresado en el acuerdo de bolognia es importante destacar el otorgamiento de validez a los t tulos otorgados en distintos pa ses los t tulos trasnacionales implican la necesidad de contar con est ndares mundiales de evaluaci n en esta demanda la investigaci n y la revisi n de los contenidos curriculares de las carreras son prioridades universitarias
8076580 el mundo tiene nuevos desaf os por los cuales las universidades tienen que responder
8076581 la inversi n del estado en educaci n superior debe crecer mas todav a se ha hecho mucho pero sin dudas debemos seguir creciendo en este punto si aspiramos a estar entre las universidades m s prestigiosas del continente
8076582 los europeos ya no hablan de la sociedad de conocimiento sino de la econom a del conocimiento para poder competir con los eeuu
8076583 nuestro estado deber preocuparse s o s en la trasnacionalizaci n de los t tulos universitarios y en mejorar la calidad educativa
8076584 en este nuevo tipo de sociedad las instituciones del conocimiento ser n las m s importantes de todas particularmente las universidades
8076585 primero en el modo en que se transmiten los conocimientos segundo en capacitar en la gesti n de flujos de informaci n y tercero asumiendo que en una sociedad cambiante la universidad debe cambiar
8076586 lo ideal ser a aumentar la base cient fica del pa s hasta contar con tres investigadores y tecn logos por cada mil personas
8076587 hace falta incorporar casi 3000 cient ficos por a o y hoy con fortuna llegan a 500
8076588 mas de diez a os con la planta de personal del conicet congelada desmotiva a cualquiera
8076589 hacer enfoque en la oferta es equivocado y ser a bueno atender tambi n la demanda aunque sta sea muy cambiante
8076590 con el sistema de becas del conicet no alcanza debe haber becas en el sistema universitario y tambi n en postgrados el gobierno nacional esta haciendo un esfuerzo en este punto en particular eso s hay que fortalecer los postgrados mejor rankeados fomentar mucho m s la asociatividad y apuntar a una reforma organizacional del sistema universitario
8076591 en la b squeda de consensos para una nueva ley de educaci n superior
8076592 es necesario efectuar algunos ajustes en la ley que data de 1995
8076593 es bueno que exista la voluntad de completar algunas lagunas que la misma presentaba
8076594 hay consensos b sicos y m s de 50 documentos de las distintas universidades que contienen lineamientos para poder modificar en aspectos importantes a la ley de educaci n superior existente
8076595 la nueva ley debe estar referida al sistema de educaci n superior y no a la universidad en particular y es de esperarse que contenga en su seno tanto a las que son de origen privado como publicas
8076596 el sistema naci hace 50 a os impulsado por frondizi y apoyado por salonia aqu presente hemos tenido una ley de educaci n superior cada diez a os ahora si cada diez a os se cambian las reglas universitarias esto confunde a cualquiera no estoy en contra de la reforma pero hay que ser muy cuidadosos con los cambios que se quieran introducir
8076597 hay que lograr una sustentabilidad econ mica financiera e institucional y de no ser as estaremos ante una gran debilidad
8076598 debemos apuntar al trabajo de jornada completa en nuestras universidades
8076599 una adecuada articulaci n entre la educaci n media y la universidad
8076600 miles de estudiantes dejan sus estudios cuando dejan la escuela media y si no logramos mejorar la educaci n media de nada servir parir una nueva ley
8076601 tratemos que los chicos terminen bien el secundario sino seguiremos teniendo un 19 por ciento de graduados contra un 80 por ciento que tienen los pa ses desarrollados
8076602 quiero compartir con ustedes en base a la labor que realic como docente universitario decano y gobernador la experiencia de c mo trabajamos para llevar la universidad a la gente de bajarla hacia la sociedad hacia el estado y el gobierno y a partir de all c mo trabajamos en forma conjunta para brindar las respuestas que la sociedad pretende de la universidad tenemos grandes problemas en nuestra sociedad y la universidad no puede ni debe estar ajena a ellos
8076603 no se debe cambiar y perder la previsibilidad a veces tantos cambios no permiten una visi n a largo plazo y necesitamos soluciones que se prolonguen en el tiempo
8076604 un modelo de pa s no lo da el sistema econ mico sino el modelo educativo pero ste en su conjunto no s lo el universitario por eso es sumamente importante articular con el nivel medio y este a su vez con el primario
8076605 en algunos pa ses como el nuestro existen comportamientos pendulares y es en el sistema educativo donde tenemos que conseguir y asegurar el equilibrio sin pasar de un extremo a otro por eso estoy convencido que es el modelo educativo quien tiene que definir el modelo de pa s
8076606 argentina ocup un lugar preponderante en el continente porque en el sistema educativo argentino se trabajaba en forma integral con estructura con responsabilidad de todos los actores porque exist a una cultura del esfuerzo con una conciencia de clase que pretend a progresar y con una movilidad social ascendente esa cultura del esfuerzo la hemos perdido entonces no podemos hablar del esfuerzo en el trabajo si previamente no formamos una cultura del estudio
8076607 hemos cambiado a lo largo de nuestra historia la realidad a veces para ocultarla y llegamos a hacer cosas como por ejemplo dar marcha atr s con el sistema num rico o desechar los globales por ello debemos entender que el conocimiento es integral y debemos recuperarlo hay que volver a las cosas simples hemos complejizado todo a lo largo de nuestra historia nos preocupamos mucho por temas pedag gicos pero bajamos los niveles de exigencia estamos de acuerdo con que el sistema educativo debe ser incluyente pero no retener a los alumnos a partir del facilismo debemos establecer pol ticas duraderas a partir de programas que no funcionen como parches
8076608 cuando se realizan encuestas sobre los temas que le preocupan a la gente resaltan siempre tres inseguridad falta de educaci n y desempleo nosotros tuvimos una experiencia notable en cuanto a responsabilidad social universitaria utilizamos las instalaciones ociosas del ej rcito argentino y nos propusimos capacitar y educar en ese lugar a chicos que estaban en la calle el programa se llam servicio c vico voluntario y de 22 adolescentes que integraban inicialmente el plan piloto llegamos a 4 200 personas con aprendizaje en oficio y terminalidad educativa al sistema universitario le solicitamos que participara en este programa y dieran clases de cultura general educaci n sexual sobre el tema legal de c mo hacer un contrato etc tera en la nueva ley de educaci n superior deber a incluirse este concepto sobre la responsabilidad social universitaria

8076706 we live in a parliamentary democracy and this government seems to want to avoid parliament like the plague
8076707 is there an abuse here of executive authority if the government can cancel any program it chooses where does it stop
8076708 all the opposition parties are clear they will not support this government going to october 2009
8076709 in the lack of certainty about an election date it falls to the government to create that certainty
8076710 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty

8076724 again it is an over reaction to a defeat i experienced that and we are experiencing it again but england have one of the top managers in the world in capello and i wish them good luck in the qualifiers
8076725 but england is not my problem any more the only thing i am worried about or bothered about is being successful with fc twente
8076726 they have given me an opportunity to work in holland at a good club with good people and i want to pay them back

8076740 at which there was no reason not to do it from their standpoint its historically true valid the people of these countries no longer want to be associated with georgia particularly under the condition that theres no sign of the elimination this criminal regime there
8076741 my position is that you have a criminal government of georgia a george soros british intelligence government of georgia
8076742 which of course does not really represent the interests of the georgian people but its a criminal regime its in power its backed from abroad for the time being theres no reason that the people of these countries would want anything to do with georgia as long as that kind of government is ruling georgia
8076743 the other side is of course historically that in the long history of russia ossetia and abkhazia are areas which were autonomous regions
8076744 and if anyone has any problem with it in the united states
8076745 they should face the truth about what happened with the georgian war crimes against the people of south ossetia
8076746 the saakashvili government is essentially a government of george soros which means its a subsidiary of the british foreign office lets not have any more of these lies and explanations the fact is that saakashvili is a creation of george soros who is himself an agent of the british foreign office so its a british imperialist operation which has committed atrocities against the people of south ossetia

8076750 everett rogers research has been formative in the strategies of how some new ideas become a commonly adopted practice popularized in his book diffusion of innovations ive seen rogers bell curve used in presentations to describe different groups of people and their attitudes towards trying or using something new would you believe that this theory was first developed from colleagues have put together this really great graphic about how innovations spread click on the chart to see full size what i like about this chart is its additional overlay of learning styles for each psychographic profile and 3 factors that can accelerate the development and the spread of a new idea this chart is certainly very important for an organization like leadership network that has a mission to help innovative leaders multiply their impact i think its fair to say that multiplying impact has a lot to do with accelerating the development of an innovation that results in positive change and to spread that innovation so that many more can learn how to do likewise diffusion of innovations further describes the thought process someone goes through when encountering a new idea or practice rogers innovation decision process theory states that innovation diffusion is a process that occurs over time through five stages knowledge persuasion decision implementation and confirmation accordingly the innovation decision process is the process through which an individual or other decision making unit passes through 5 steps from first knowledge of an innovation to forming an attitude toward the innovation to a decision to adopt or reject to implementation of the new idea and what do you find most helpful in this chart what do you think of these learning styles and accelerators are these strategies and or programs that your organization or you have used to introduce something new

8076753 if woolworths appeal to the supreme court is successful and woolworths is granted a clearance foodstuffs will also face no competition issues if it decides to purchase further shares in the warehouse
8076754 if woolworths appeal is unsuccessful again both companies are in the same position
8076755 we have previously put some strong arguments to the commission and the courts as to why any acquisition would be lawful i am comfortable that the supreme court will be in a position to properly consider the issues
8076756 we will await with interest the outcome of the woolworths appeal and as we have consistently said we would not rule anything in or anything out going forward
8076757 we know there are people out there with vital information which can assist us in identifying the six youths who came to the tower block that day
8076758 it may be they havent contacted us because they dont want to get involved or think other people are bound to come forward
8076759 we are always concerned about any provision that comes out as inadequate that extra 3 does concern us
8076760 but the encouraging thing is that when we do go back and reinspect 95 of those provisions inspected for the second time will come out as satisfactory or better
8076761 in the 30 most deprived areas 53 of childminders provide good or better childcare compared with 60 in the rest of the country

8076763 we are concerned that theres a variation and it doesnt seem fair that children in deprived areas seem to get a worse deal than those in more affluent areas
8076764 i am a childminder who has been doing the job for three years and i am thinking of giving up the paperwork side of it is ridiculous
8076765 we now have to do risk assessments observations planning and we have to now be registered as a food premises because we give snacks or a meal

8076768 while it takes an entire county board to deliver results like these commissioner turners legacy is that he helped build a culture of high expectations both in performance and continuous improvement that will live on
8076769 we balance the interest and the dollars that you spend against the needs of the county thats a tightrope
8076770 that is just one of his demonstrated great services that hes done for the people of burnsville
8076771 as an operational body you cant let those political ties get in the way of providing the citizens with good government
8076772 the county commissioner is a nonpartisan position and should stay that way
8076773 hes been a great leader in terms of developing more collaboration between the members of the criminal justice system

8076809 she is female which addresses the novelty of the opposition she is smart and well respected she is knowledgeable on key issues especially domestic policy
8076810 i still think its going to be former massachusetts governor mitt romney
8076811 shes been around for decades and is not going to start making mistakes now
8076812 her nomination would be a signal to american women that mccain takes their aspirations seriously even if obama does not hutchison is not charismatic but her circumstances would be if she were nominated the prospect of a woman vice president would electrify women throughout the nation
8076813 she has clearly set her sights on governor and looks at that as the way she wants to complete her long and distinguished career of public service
8076814 the conservatives could probably stomach hutchison a lot better than a tom ridge or joe lieberman
8076815 she is a woman and their strategy seems to be to go for disaffected hillary clinton voters but i would say this is more like the chet edwards boomlet it raises the profile there is no downside to being mentioned but hutchison at this point looks like a last minute ploy not a considered judgment
8076816 ok shes not a dynamo of fiery charisma in fact as ive noted before shes a bland and sometimes boring speaker and a pleasant if unprepossessing television presence nevertheless she is a she and that fact in itself would allow mccains choice to upstage obamas
8076817 she wouldnt add much to the slate but she is a southerner and female
8076818 some people think kay bailey hutchison in texas i think thats unlikely
8076819 this was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november
8076820 but underneath that and in the background there is also a different story which we dont want to unearth much on the convention floor because its not really what were trying to do but which you should be mindful of
8076821 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8076822 we have the man we need at last to embrace the future not the past and to dispel eight years of pain and shame barack obama is his name call the roll

8076828 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8076829 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8076830 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8076831 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8076832 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002

8076837 lazione della russia peggiora la situazione e complica i negoziati diplomatici
8076838 in conformit con le risoluzioni del consiglio di sicurezza delle nazioni unite che restano in vigore labkhazia e lossezia del sud si trovano entro i confini internazionalmente riconosciuti della georgia e devono restare tali
8076839 si cambia il pilastro della cittadinanza e lo si sostituisce con la base etnica e ci ci deve seriamente preoccupare
8076840 almeno di un rapporto che possa portare nei prossimi mesi a una riconciliazione e stabilit nel caucaso
8076841 al di l di questo riconoscimento unilaterale che non ha ovviamente il crisma della legalit internazionale
8076842 questa scelta del governo russo significa che hanno scelto una politica di contrasto non solo nei confronti del resto deuropa ma anche con la comunit internazionale in generale
8076843 il riconoscimento di indipendenza per lossezia del sud e labkhazia viola i principi fondamentali dellosce
8076844 dovrebbe seguire i principi dellosce rispettando lintegrit territoriale e la sovranit della georgia
8076845 qui bisogna costruire un piano di attacco una tonante messa in stato daccusa delle politiche fallimentari di bush e mccain

8076847 nessuna e il giorno di hillary clinton cresce lattesa per il suo discorso
8076848 they always got their votes counted why is it different now because hillary is a woman
8076849 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8076850 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8076851 we need in the white house starting on january 20th barack obama and joe biden
8076852 still doesnt believe that women deserve equal pay for equal work
8076853 he doesnt believe that women deserve the right to choose
8076854 he would turn the clock back when what we need from our president is forward movement more progress the kind of opportunities that we expect for the next generation of americans
8076855 we find that the cost of capturing co2 with the complete system would fall between 80 and 250 t co2 and improvements are suggested which reduce the upper bound cost to 130 t co2 even at the high calculated cost air capture has implications for climate policy however dedicated engineering and technological innovation have potential to produce much lower cost systems
8076856 new technology that i do not understand will save us
8076857 as noted the models do not consider the possibility of an equilibration of the climate with a steady increase in aerosol as would actually occur thus the modeling is deficient in addressing this important reality
8076858 with interest i follow when capturing co2 from the air will be the lowest cost system
8076859 does this mean you support a carbon tax of up to 250 ton co2 to pay for it
8076860 there is no hard evidence that aerosol geoengineering would a result in dangerous reductions in stratospheric ozone or b lead to harmful acid precipitation
8076861 there is no linear predictability in terms of how ecosystems respond the phenomena of collapse is one that we have under appreciated partly because of the feed back mechanisms that we are still trying to understand
8076862 leemans and eickhout 2004 found that adaptive capacity decreases rapidly with an increasing rate of climate change their study finds that five percent of all ecosystems cannot adapt more quickly than 0 1 c per decade over time forests will be among the ecosystems to experience problems first because their ability to migrate to stay within the climate zone they are adapted to is limited if the rate is 0 3 c per decade 15 percent of ecosystems will not be able to adapt if the rate should exceed 0 4 c per decade all ecosystems will be quickly destroyed opportunistic species will dominate and the breakdown of biological material will lead to even greater emissions of co2 this will in turn increase the rate of warming
8076863 another reason for concern regional and global impacts on ecosystems for different levels of climate change
8076864 few seem to realise that the present ipcc models predict almost unanimously that by 2040 the average summer in europe will be as hot as the summer of 2003 when over 30 000 died from heat by then we may cool ourselves with air conditioning and learn to live in a climate no worse than that of baghdad now but without extensive irrigation the plants will die and both farming and natural ecosystems will be replaced by scrub and desert what will there be to eat the same dire changes will affect the rest of the world and i can envisage americans migrating into canada and the chinese into siberia but there may be little food for any of them
8076865 peak temperatures may rise twice as fast as average temperatures as climate change hots up
8076866 again i refer to the total abstention from other future possibilities although all the concerns deal with possible futures please see again goettmann fr d ric arne thomas and markus antonietti 2007 metal free activation of co2 by mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride angewandte chemie vol 46 no 15 pp 2717 2720 april 2 2007 if needed the future solution is e g this artificial photosynthesis besides nature and man gets the extra biomass urgently needed the main message is that human ingenuity will resolve this co2 problem if it exists at all
8076867 a much discussed idea to offset global warming by injecting sulfate particles into the stratosphere would have a drastic impact on earths protective ozone layer new research concludes the study led by simone tilmes of the national center for atmospheric research ncar in boulder colo warns that such an approach would delay the recovery of the antarctic ozone hole by decades and cause significant ozone loss over the arctic
8076868 the economics of geoengineering are there is no better word for it incredible according to teller et al 2003 5 engineered particles would be even cheaper mainly because of the reduced volume of material that would need to be put into the stratosphere they estimate that the sunlight scattering needed to offset the warming effect of rising greenhouse gas concentrations by the year 2100 would cost just 1 billion per year
8076869 the greens resistance to geo engineering sits very uncomfortably with its message that the planet is screwed and were all going to die it suggests that they dont actually believe their own press releases and that they know the situation is not as dire as they would like the rest of us to think it is it suggests that environmentalists regard science and engineering as the cause of problems and not the solution
8076870 i hope i never need a parachute but if my plane is going down in flames i sure hope i have a parachute handy
8076871 i hope well never need geoengineering schemes but if a climate catastrophe occurs i sure hope we will have thought through our options carefully
8076872 methadone is a pretty good metaphor kind of like saccharine sugarless sodas and decaf coffee not really facing the problem
8076873 we all know that we have to convert all coal fired power plants to nuclear worldwide by 2015 but it wont happen because the average american has an irrational fear of all things nuclear
8076874 measurements from space since the 1970s give a global annual earth albedo of 0 29 the average incident solar radiative flux is 341 w m 2 so that a change in albedo of 0 01 represents a global energy balance change of 3 4 w m 2 similar in magnitude to the impact of doubling carbon dioxide in the atmosphere global albedo can change with changes in earths cloud fractional coverage cloud thickness aerosol amount forest cover or snow and ice cover for example a 2 year change in albedo was caused by the large mount pinatubo volcanic eruption in june 1991 stratospheric aerosols from the eruption increased global albedo by up to 0 007 because of the reflection of an additional 2 5 w m 2 of solar radiation over the following 2 years
8076875 its not the whole biosphere at risk here except for very human centric definitions of biosphere its mostly the charismatic megafauna that are in trouble if you include people as charismatic debatable yes
8076876 all we have to do to destroy the planets climate and its biota and leave a ruined world to our children and grandchildren is to just keep on where were going today just keep releasing greenhouse gases at current rates just keep degrading and homogenizing and destroying our biological resources just continue releasing toxic chemicals at current rates and by the latter part of this century the world wont be fit to live in

8076884 basically i am wondering how energy intensive grinding up rock is it cant be too intensive for coal or else it wouldnt be useful as an energy source but im guessing coal is a bit softer than granite or basalt

8076894 all over the world all throughout this year i have seen how rotary shares
8076895 ive seen that rotary shares in every amazing way you could imagine and then some
8076896 its been three and a half years since that terrible catastrophe
8076897 you dont see it in the news anymore but rotarians havent forgotten because theyve been busy rebuilding
8076898 what i think is so significant about this grant is what it says about rotary that the gates foundation gave the money to rotary international before we had raised even one penny of matching funds
8076899 and we recognize that the rotary community is one that we all belong to regardless of the place we call home
8076900 the world is here to see rotary and the los angeles rotarians are playing host to the world
8076901 its a fantastic experience for them and a great honor for me
8076902 people who have never been to one are missing the best part of rotary its the celebration of the year
8076903 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past

8076912 if you woke up in the morning and read in the wall street journal that an ecommerce company like overstock com had stopped using the usps ups fedex dhl etc to deliver their goods and instead leased airport hubs all over the world bought a fleet of jets and bought thousands of trucks and started delivering the stuff themselves youd think they were out of their minds so why is it not equally insane for financial services companies health care institutions manufacturing companies bio tech companies pharmaceutical giants etc to be spending a billion dollars or much more every year on information technology infrastructure

8076977 bids are invited for the design layout typesetting and print production of the organizations 2000 annual report the designer is expected to present a design concept for the publication showing the overall design and the treatment for each of the elements when awarding the contract both the concept and the price are going to be taken into consideration
8076978 a lot of this pitching happens in australia and new zealand as well we frequently are involved in free pitches i consider them a necessary evil to doing business and cannot see alternatives given that our client market likes to play things that way
8076979 in the late 80s and early 90s this was just the way it worked you did the unpaid pitch or the work never seemed to come your way
8076980 these days when asked to make a speculative presentation many local agencies tell the prospective client that the presentation is not going to be free and many clients accept that these clients are professional enough to realize that the agency is spending valuable time money and effort so they agree to pay a rejection fee an amount mutually agreed upon beforehand
8076981 the graphic artists guild is unalterably opposed to any artist being asked to work on speculation because of the inherent risks to the artist in such circumstances art buyers should not ask artists to work on a project unless a fee has been agreed upon in advance artists must be adequately compensated at any time they are requested to create artwork working on speculation places all the risks on the artist without a commitment on the buyers part
8076982 a designer shall not undertake any work at the invitation of a client without payment of an appropriate fee
8076983 just like asking a construction company to build a house before one decides to actually buy it
8076984 there are other more appropriate methods of selecting a designer
8076985 the process of selecting a designer is largely trial and error and there are those who try to avoid the possibility of error by employing competition like methods of designer selection it is not something i do leaving the obvious ethical argument alone it just doesnt make sense from a business perspective having three different people or firms work on the same project at the same time is taxing on our own internal resources first wed have to educate them as to the nature of the business second wed have to give direction on the project itself and monitor its progress id much rather interview people see their work and make an educated guess as to who is better suited to a particular project while i may ask them to pitch a concept i wouldnt expect them to execute it prior to formally engaging their services
8076986 i do not do work on a speculative basis if someone wants to test drive me as a designer for future projects they pay for my time at my usual rates
8076987 lets say for the sake of argument that we have a budget of 100 000 we may take 5 000 and divide it between three people or firms thereby covering their initial expenses the firm that does the best work wins the project
8076988 but they need to race the world cup circuit if we want them to be competitive at the highest level american nmbs and canada cups plus at once a year trip to the worlds just doesnt cut it

8076992 i never thought that economic environmental development would come this far i knew that investments from private individuals would surely come but from the major investment houses no way
8076993 speaking from a personal viewpoint i believe that the more we can get out of this time period the better
8076994 we can all look forward and predict financial success for all involved but that comes tempered with a bit of risk right now
8076995 we find this paper about economic environmental development from woods spetter to be a strong testament to our industrys growth and potential it clearly outshines the detractors and any negative points
8076996 time especialy when it comes to economic environmental development is of the essence we dont have time to mess around and blow our chances at what could be a fantastic opportunity
8076997 i dont want to ruin the parade but somme humility and financial restraint in a sector dominated by economic environmental development firms would go a long way
8076998 well who knows he may be announcing some new intergalactic agreement of some kind or other you never know whats going to come out
8076999 what i would like to see him do is focus on the real economic issues
8077000 hes got to tell the australian people why he wants to raise a raft of new inflationary taxes when the government already has a huge surplus when inflation is elevated and every one of these taxes will put upward pressure on inflation
8077001 the objective of good government is for government to raise no more money than it needs
8077002 i think its important from time to time that the prime minister take the opportunity at venues like the press club to outline and update our plans for the future
8077003 im not about to blow the lid on whats about to be said today but we have a clear agenda following on from the commitment we made at the last election
8077004 i worked in the economic environmental development internet marketing field for two years before going solo
8077005 and business finally started to bloom big time when i learned to harvest the power of search engine optimization with my economic environmental development sites ranking higher than ever my profits soared
8077006 i followed the great economic environmental development webmasters guide by allena mccomis who details some simple website plans that one can build from readily available templates
8077007 you dont want to inadvertently steal someone elses hard work
8077008 but at the same time you have to cite your sources so that your claims to economic environmental development knowledge are based on fact
8077009 i ran to the nearest marketing forums and began spilling the beans about how my websites achieved top positions in the search engines two months later my competition who read all my posts figured out how to top my sites and i lost 30 of my revenues fool me once shame on me
8077010 mostly because i had no clue what to do there were no guides or reference books just my gut instinct over time i trusted my intuition and used common sense to move forward
8077011 also dont forget that your economic environmental development marketing can beging from day one start getting links from authority sites and coordinate press releases
8077012 when my website got going i soon received many offers from foreign companies with stolen email lists and sleazy marketing methods they promise quick riches the easy way but in fact there is no easy way to making bank in the economic environmental development field it comes down to creativity and hard work
8077013 i want better health insurance and economic environmental development training seminars

8077073 we are investigating a matter which relates to a police officer and i guess my point at this stage is we are investigating and i think various people are speculating at what it is but weve had concerns about his behaviour and we are investigating that
8077074 we have a variety of ways we conduct investigations were comfortable with the way we are investigating that
8077075 theres a whole variety of ways we find out about officers behaving badly our ethical standards department does an outstanding job
8077076 what people need to understand is that police officers do have discretion many officers exercise that discretion in a number of ways
8077077 what we require of our officers when they do that though is that they are open and transparent
8077078 people have a right to some privacy in policing while we investigate the matter

8077100 he is a little like adlai stevenson you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy soundbite
8077101 hes not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8077102 with people who have a lot of gifts its hard for people to identify with them
8077103 barack obama is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8077104 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy soundbite
8077105 weve got to start smacking back in short understandable bites
8077106 everybody is nervous as all get out everybody says we ought to be ahead by 10 15 points what the heck is going on
8077107 what i think most people are waiting for and as soon as they see it i think its over theyre waiting to see that hes angry about that stuff too not just that he thinks its wrong intellectually that hes angry

8077109 police chief ghanim al quraishi gave orders to organise the fighting in this district hwaider very secretly
8077110 the 2nd battalion of iraqi police moved to hwaider whose people witnessed severe military clashes between the mehdi army and police
8077111 a big verbal quarrel took place earlier in the governors office between al quraishi who is a badr organisation member and followers of sadr
8077112 four years ago if you said wed be at a hillary happy hour at the dnc i would have called you crazy but today is a great opportunity for people who agree that sen barack obama doesnt have the experience to be president of the united states
8077113 im a registered republican for the first time in my voting life
8077114 he reminds me of what the jimmy carter era was like if they think jimmy carter had it bad just wait if obama gets into the white house that will be bad news in so many ways
8077115 his lack of experience has been demonstrated so painfully every time he opens his mouth just about you cannot have good judgment without experience thats how you get it
8077116 just discredited her because of some imagined baggage she carried from her husbands administration
8077117 the simple fact remains change will occur anyway no matter who the president is for every man woman and child change will happen question is who is best able to handle that change
8077118 the dnc really pushed barack obama on us now theyve left us with two choices somebody who has no substance or a republican
8077119 and these are terrible choices and they worked hard to select this candidate were watching the dnc pick this candidate for us
8077120 were taking a stand and not backing down its we the people not we the dnc we are standing up for what is right i know in my heart
8077121 im marching because of the treatment hillary received during the primaries she was treated so unfairly by the media and the dnc and no one stood up to say anything about it until after theyd asked her to leave and that was ridiculous the media totally geared and led this campaign
8077122 obama wasnt elected he was selected if you look at all the caucus fraud youll see his delegate lead was only in the red states she won the popular vote and she should be the nominee
8077123 were here to represent hillary clinton and show her that were not going to follow the party line like weve always done
8077124 i will not support obama hes not qualified the whole system was totally fraudulent he claimed to be something before in the primaries that was different that was a new kind of politics but hes not hes not washington politics hes chicago style politics and thats even worse
8077125 these people are trying to scare us about roe v wade well you know what i am beyond my reproductive years i dont care its time for these young obama women who think its so cool to support him they can worry about their own reproductive rights
8077126 one of the basic fundamental platforms of the dnc is against sexism
8077127 antisemitism lets have a little bit of that or next time lets have a little bit of racism or maybe have a little bit of gay bashing next time
8077128 they sacrificed women because they could take their vote for granted and that is not what democrats stand for
8077129 there is such a fear of women coming into power that when they protest they are given more weight
8077130 just the fact of women saying they support their candidate and want to make their voices heard sounds more scary than it would be if it were guys thats just part of backlash but come on when women gather around a water fountain men get scared people oughta just chill
8077131 we are in the middle of a revolution women are stepping up and taking power
8077132 ask pelosi why she asked hillary to get out of the race
8077133 if it gets rowdy ill step to the side i consider that march a thank you to hillary for having not given up
8077134 why why why did she ask clinton to leave the race and why did she encourage superdelegates not to vote for her that whole speech she just gave was about how women have to strive for power but she used her own power to diminish and destroy clintons
8077135 if obama loses the election dont think it wont be hillary whos blamed
8077136 dennis kucinich got one and shirley chisholm i dont understand why it should be such a big deal
8077137 my hope is that in the first round of voting i get to vote for her and in the second round i will vote for obama
8077138 a vote for hillary is a vote for history and not against him
8077139 but this was the first woman to win a primary and then primary after primary after primary i think how we unify the party is to recognize the history that this candidate made
8077140 only because i can see exactly how the media will portray it
8077141 this is the right thing to do for the party im not disruptive i believe this is the best way to recognize what hillary symbolizes i was elected to come to this convention and vote for hillary clinton
8077142 this is not about anger this is not about a lack of desire for party unity we all want to elect a democrat in november but why wouldnt her name be placed in nomination she is the only woman who has ever come this far her achievement represents a giant moment in american history we just want to celebrate that
8077143 we had a huge turnout in the primary and they turned out for hillary the democratic party tells us that a delegates job is to in good conscience reflect the sentiments of the people who elected them i dont know why they equate an expression of democracy with ruining the convention hopefully hillary supporters will be respectful but i dont think its disrespectful to cast the vote i was sent here to cast
8077144 i heard were not going to be able to say and the great state of colorado
8077145 and he was allowed to have a roll call i just cant believe whats happening here party leadership wants to show that were a party of unity but what its doing is fracturing the party
8077146 id best get out of here before i get to fighting
8077147 weve been told that most of hillarys supporters have united behind mccain that is absolute crap
8077148 our foremothers marched in the streets so that our voices could be heard we will not be silenced now
8077149 we are really sick and tired of having womens rights held over our heads as a threat
8077150 i want to make it an open convention where delegates make their voices heard
8077151 look i know about the race card i know about race im african american and it was obama who played the race card and its going to come back and bite obama in the butt
8077152 are proud yes i understand that but you want someone who can lead america not because hes african american or because shes a certain gender but because she can lead
8077153 she can stand on her head and plead with us and i still will not vote for him i want her she is best for the country
8077154 ill tell you who should get blamed if he loses
8077155 when someone puts a mic in our face and asks what about the hillary supporter or the person who supported bill richardson or dennis kucinich we will say we are democrats in a way that it will be so shocking to whoever asked the question that they will just stand back
8077156 they will say let them just walk on by there is some kind of glory walking by theres a light over there we are democrats we are one we are one nation we are empowered we are strengthened we are democrats
8077157 she won the nationwide popular vote and one of the reasons the caucuses came out different is there was fraud and voter intimidation
8077158 what were hearing is delegates are being taken into rooms and being browbeaten being told there will be no future in the party for you if you dont fall in line
8077159 i dont believe in my heart that she believes in her heart that sen obama can lead this country
8077160 anyone who claims to want to lead this country should at least begin by loving and respecting this country
8077161 his greatest gaffe was when he said this is america the greatest country in the world now join me in changing it
8077162 i believe that senator mccain at least begins by having a general respect and love for this country its people traditions and a love of the armed forces
8077163 everything hes done has been a coldly calculated move up the ladder of politics
8077164 prepare your outside work make it fit for yourself in the field and afterward build your house
8077165 you never get a second chance to make a first impression
8077166 for which of you intending to buid a tower does not sit down first and count the cost whether he has enough to finish it lest after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish all who see it begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish
8077167 i want to be pain free before i start swinging i just need it to where its comfortable when i swing

8077185 we are facing extraordinary growth whether we like it or not and to accommodate that it is important that we have child care said councilman sam liccardo
8077186 we dont like the decision but we are willing to work with the community for a year at 45 beck said
8077187 i have come up with what i hope and think is as balanced an approach to this project as possible
8077188 i am sorry that mrs beck made a poor choice from the beginning without doing her homework
8077189 why does someone who doesnt live in the district get more consideration than the people who do
8077190 but starting a good economic environmental development outfit can be even more challenging
8077191 be prepared for a wait of on average 3 5 years before expecting any sort of return that is the way the economic environmental development market works and with patience you can walk with big money
8077192 but its really no different than the enigma of day trading or forex people are not necessarily afraid of investment process but merely of the high risk involved
8077193 its better to look through the mid range economic environmental development companies for ones with strong growth potential
8077194 im thrilled to report record growth in the economic environmental development sector
8077195 this signifies that anyone who invested their money more than three years ago saw a 25 return on their money which is fabulous
8077196 weve seen more people getting into investing and more company executives doing more aggressive marketing and sales with the knowledge that they are backed by a diverse number of share holders
8077197 its a shame that our industry isnt seen as more main stream
8077198 if more main stream investors got involved through good brokerages wed see a higher division of risk across the board this is especially important in our business model because if we rely on one or two large investment firms they can end up constantly twisting our elbows
8077199 with the internet and vast array of research information available starting up is much easier and significantly less costly this allows us to push profits right away and to establish a solid presence in the economic environmental development field quickly
8077200 and they took it very seriously confidentiality especially in the economic environmental development market is of core important and these students were able to finish a great analysis without duress
8077201 i always tell my economic environmental development clients to wait at minimum 18 months before evaluating the success of a particular investment
8077202 that way those who get jittery early on allow themselves a chance to see the investment through
8077203 i really appreciate their selection and that they sell christian friendly videos i am also really pleased with their low prices and free shipping i will definitely recommend them to friends thanks
8077204 saving god is dramatic and full of the power of christs love and forgiveness its possibly the best film weve ever made
8077205 thats my understanding i know ufc president dana white has been announcing it publicly we havent officially signed a bout agreement but everything is pointing toward january 31 in vegas against b j penn
8077206 im a fighter and i want to stay busy i want to fight all the best people there are a lot of people who think joe stevenson is still a top 10 fighter and im not i still have a lot to prove out there for me i just want to fight the toughest guys the titles great of course id be thrilled having a world title belt or whatever but for me its about becoming a better fighter at the end of the day joe stevenson is a tough fighter hes got a lot of experience he presents a lot of problems hes a short stocky wrestler whos also great on the ground and has a solid boxing background hes similar to sean sherk with actually probably better submissions maybe hes not as good with the takedowns but he has great jiu jitsu great submissions hes catching a lot of people left and right i wouldnt be surprised if i went out there and knocked out joe stevenson in the first 10 seconds and they were like kenny got lucky and he still has to prove himself hell never beat sean sherk or b j penn and tyson griffins a better fighter for whatever reason people are still doubting me its normal
8077207 the outcome will be sickness and death and homelessness and for those cut off from health coverage and help
8077208 challenge is a wonderful word because it all starts with a change
8077209 you cannot just affrod to be just a bedroom community you really got to develop your own economy you got to create your own jobs especially with the high price of energy today and the cost of communiting
8077210 the movie fargo which didnt even take place in the statethe recent national geogrpahic piece that they did on the emptying prairie those are negative type things that unfortunately are the brands that people associate with north dakota and i think north dakota really need to develop a brand of this is a great state we are creating jobs we got 15 thousand job openings rght now in the state of north dakota north dakota had a 7 5 percent growth in gdp in the last year
8077211 touch me mr broker and ill spray your eyes with mace
8077212 we are very excited and enthused by the reaction to what weve done here
8077213 but the traffic appears to be mild the economy has kept a lot of people home
8077214 the feedback we are getting is that attendance overall is disappointing
8077215 stay in front of the consumer if retailers can finish the year in the black they should be well positioned for next year
8077216 i think were going to be in the piece business for a while
8077217 maybe theyre buying a sofa a bed or a piece for that flat screen tv
8077218 color excites people not just sofas but something in the bedroom other than brown or cherry something that both sells and would stand out on the floor were trying to put in some lipstick some excitement something that would connect with the female consumer
8077219 at market well be looking for opportunities in other categories perhaps bedroom dining and leather
8077220 were going to be looking for exceptional value and i think the buying groups become even more significant to all of us with the import situation
8077221 being able to flow goods split containers and things like that have made a huge difference for all of us
8077222 im sure there will be lots of specials but im just afraid of anything new or untested
8077223 you have to focus on what you want to accomplish in the end
8077224 that doesnt mean traditional isnt selling but theyre looking for cleaner traditional contemporary and transitional
8077225 but the customer is not looking for low priced furniture
8077226 casual dining and leather are probably two of the categories were focusing a lot of attention on to replace an existing vendor
8077227 and the second thing were starting to see is more people are shopping locally
8077228 they dont feel that they have to drive that 100 miles to the city to get the selection or price
8077229 the upholstery out there is so vanilla well be looking for accent pillows and rugs and accessory pieces that have color so you can switch up a room without a big investment
8077230 as far as having huge needs i cant say we have big plans to go out and buy up a bunch of stuff
8077231 looking to expand our offering in contemporary bedroom which has been very strong for us
8077232 i thank god who has been with me through this gruelling election process i thank the voters
8077233 the message is clear we have made a demand for change for freedom and for justice
8077234 the people do not want to be exploited we want an economic order that protects all the people
8077235 yes of course we have lost we were the underdogs going into this race
8077236 this is a clear indication that people of all races have rejected the communal politics of barisan nasional it is a clear endorsement of our reform agenda we are on track to take over the government
8077237 ive had more contact from the mccain campaign since the nomination than from the obama campaign
8077238 i still firmly believe there is a tremendous amount of untapped resources that can be tapped if the obama campaign pro actively engages people in the clinton world
8077239 there are no laws or rules that prohibit the use of the voip technology within the state of qatar
8077240 does however make it illegal for any person to provide telecommunication services to the public for a direct or indirect fee without a licence issued by ictqatar for that purpose
8077241 any person or business in qatar may use voip services for their own use but nobody may sell voip calls or services to the public or businesses without a valid licence
8077242 the focus of the ban is on resale of the facility without a licence the supreme council for information and communications technology is committed to encourage the availability of the latest technology like voip to qatari citizens and residents
8077243 auf eine andere moderatere sprache hat der westen ja nicht reagiert die nato osterweiterung wurde durchgezogen obwohl es nachweislich feste zusagen gab die nato nicht nach osten auszudehnen

8077247 cause damage to a deeply rooted culture of segregation between male and female students
8077248 war against the culture and create confusion and alienation among students
8077249 we should not be lured by the educational philosophies made in the west every society has its own traits and our society is not prepared for such step or even will be happy with it
8077250 even some western countries have introduced single sex education system
8077251 i have visited many schools in the usa and europe and they are reviewing the policy of co education after many findings showed its drawbacks
8077252 the scheme would not be acceptable to the community at all
8077253 i believe that any step like that will be rejected by the majority our community will not be happy about the idea of mixing between men and women whether at schools or at work nothing obliges us to adopt co education system
8077254 i put a face veil and work in an exclusively female section in my office i will quit my job if it becomes obligatory for me to work in a mixed sex environment
8077255 all the qatari women are now working in public and private sectors along with men though both were products of a single sex education the problem is that the foreigners think that our community is being shackled by restrictions and traditions this notion is wrong men and women are working now on equal basis with one another in many departments and we do not hear about harassment of any type
8077256 i believe that ending the segregation of genders in university and schools will improve learning and make it attractive both males and females would be inspired by one another and have spirit of competition

8077333 im a los angeleno its special to be back here as a rotarian with the convention were making more friends already thats what its all about ideas together with relationships youre bringing people and ideas together and things happen its exciting
8077334 the best thing is you bump into strangers who later become good friends lifelong friends what more can you ask you see the family of rotary the magnitude of rotary and you are motivated and inspired
8077335 the atmosphere is wonderful the organization of this event is amazing the convention helps rotary move ahead
8077336 the convention gives us direction and focus its such a unique experience other than the traffic im really enjoying myself in l a
8077337 conventions like this one revitalize stimulate and recommit rotarians i think its a necessary event for rotarians

8077341 the russian federations actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation the nation of georgia
8077342 this a challenge to the entire world not just georgia
8077343 the point here is the russians are bluffing and theyre overplaying their hand
8077344 i am holding talks today with international partners and will be visiting ukraine to ensure the widest possible coalition against russian aggression in georgia
8077345 the ball is in the europeans court if they want a worsening in relations they will get it of course
8077346 if they want to maintain strategic relations which is in my opinion totally in the interests of russia and europe everything will go well
8077347 there is still work to do on the bill clinton front he feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process

8077353 ah the old gis data issue resurfaces this issue has been going on for years now with most localities finally understanding that they can charge for the cost of producing the data but they cant make money off of it unfortunately it appears henrico has not figured that out odd though that they were in on discussions on this very topic back in 2004 when they and other localities wanted either an exemption permission to require a license or permission to charge more for commercial users the committee studying the possibility of such a change in foia never really went anywhere and most of the localities seemed to understand that they could not pick and choose who to give data to based on what purpose they would put the data including making money off of it so the short answer to your question is yes the data is public record as public records the locality is allowed to charge the actual cost for producing it but no more if 800 is the cost of one shape file then henrico would not be barred from charging that the fact however that you are able to get multiple files for the same price in other localities who are likely using the same or similar technology seems to suggest that henrico is charging more than their actual cost you are within your rights under foia to ask them to break the cost of supplying the disks to you according to the foi advisory council the government can hold a copyright on material but copyright is not a reason to withhold records and it cannot justify charging more under foia from the 2004 discussions mentioned i also remember there was the argument that because copyright law doesnt apply to facts only the way in which the facts are arranged that the gis data was not copyrighted only the maps themselves
8077354 this is such a taboo issue to talk about it not only for the african american community but for white communities asian communities all communities

8077380 it comes at a great cost to our society as a whole
8077381 heartbreaking we have drugs that the mother can take to prevent transmission of the virus but half a million children are still born hiv positive every year
8077382 why is it that the life of an african child is worth so much less than the life of a western child
8077383 but there are moments of hope and optimism and rotary international is one of those moments
8077384 we at coca cola have long been advocates of public private partnerships
8077385 and our partnership with rotarians for fighting aids a rotarian action group is one of which we are particularly proud
8077386 to refuse to support the annual programs fund is like refusing oxygen to a living being
8077387 if every rotarian gives at least 100 every year this translates to more than 120 million annually money that will allow us to provide clean water alleviate poverty and fight hunger and illiteracy
8077388 hundreds of thousands of young people around the world participate in our developing a relationship with rotary that we must foster in the hope that some of them if not all of them will one day become rotarians and be the very future of rotary
8077389 today 33 million people worldwide are living with aids 23 million of them in africa

8077398 military kids have so much more stress than regular kids worrying about their parents having to take care of the parent thats at home more responsibility
8077399 its very sad when he goes away because you dont really know when theyll come back sometimes theyll come back in six months but sometimes it ends up being a year
8077400 the military is getting better at taking care of the families but you guys just dont know what were going into and i know theres got to be a lot of fear and uncertainty
8077401 the implication obviously is that failing to display the proper hand over heart etiquette proves obama is unpatriotic and therefore unfit to hold the office of president
8077402 sometimes he does sometimes he doesnt put his hand on his heart in no way was he making any sort of statement and any suggestion to the contrary is ridiculous
8077403 so my ridiculous statement would be when you are interviewing for a job when do you tell your hopeful employer i dont think your policies really matter

8077409 on march 9 2008 i watched your documentary with a group of my friends all women of color
8077410 aishah simmons spoke to our campus university of houston and the larger houston community and screened her film no
8077411 every organization that works with young women works with womens health works with community healing should see no and use it as a teaching tool and to spark discussion no is the path to healing that we all need
8077412 its also very important for me to note that this and many other community based screenings that have been organized by black men are men from the hip hop generation i share this because there are many justifiable critiques of hip hop however hands down the overwhelming majority of the men who have supported no and spread the word about no are from the hip hop generation
8077413 what weve found in our work with black males is that many of us brothers are completely clueless about what manhood should be so we swallow whole what society our communities our families our fathers and yes our mothers tell us it is even if that definition leads us to hurt or destroy black females or other black males or ourselves there is a growing recognition now among many hip hop generation black women thinkers leaders and artists and a growing number of us black male counterparts that if we do not deal with the multiple insanities we as a community have internalized then we are doomed as a community it is really that serious
8077414 it was a fabulous effort on behalf of the community
8077415 but i think weve been very clear that this isnt sustainable
8077416 we thought of every possible fundraising way to make money that we could

8077422 it is a woman because in the surrounding area we found offerings and textile items like those of a female weaver
8077423 prior to june and july hawaiis visitor market had managed to weather the softness that was being felt by other travel destination as a result of the slowing national economy

8077426 they re basically abandoned by their police officers or police departments in many cases
8077427 it s like a military fight i don t think that generally the american public has any sense of the level of violence that occurs on the border
8077428 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border one of the first things we did was to notify all officers in our department of the situation
8077429 we have been concerned for quite some time that this thing will spill over here
8077430 we believe the vast majority of these assaults are directly tied to alien and drug smugglers based in mexico

8077468 trafficking is a serious problem as many expatriate workers make arrangements to come and work in qatar for a certain wage and a certain number of hours but then often find themselves to be working double the hours for half the pay when they actually get here
8077469 the current sponsorship and labour laws mean that this practice is all too common and we have urged the qatari government to look into this
8077470 men and women from africa south asia and the middle east travel willingly to qatar as labourers and domestic servants but often subsequently face conditions of forced labour and physical and sexual exploitation
8077471 legislation guiding the sponsorship of expatriate labourers created conditions constituting forced labour or slavery
8077472 the dependence of foreign labourers on their employer for residency rights and the inability to change employment or to travel without the sponsors permission leaves them vulnerable to abuse and arrest
8077473 there is no evidence of institutional involvement by government bodies or officials
8077474 with its strong leadership qatar has the potential to set an example in the region
8077475 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it

8077478 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8077479 i dont know about you but thats not just right
8077480 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8077481 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8077482 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8077483 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8077484 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8077485 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8077486 i feel better than ever im excited ive got a whole new look on life i look at life on a whole nother radar

8077491 hes mature he reminds me of a rockstar to be that young i marvel at how well he handles the pressure and how far hes come along in a short amount of time he really doesnt act like a freshman quarterback its been a great transition from high school to now hes taken it so well really taken control of it im proud of him
8077492 marve likes to get out of the pocket and scramble a little bit more jacory likes to stay in the pocket
8077493 if we throw them in for 60 plays and 30 plays they dont know what theyre doing then youll have problems
8077494 we have confidence because we prepared them for the situation
8077495 theyve gotten a lot of reps in scrimmages and what not so i think theyll go into the situation and be ready theyve gotten more work than most freshman have ever here so they wont be as brand new to things
8077496 allen bailey the other day went through the whole entire individual work out and tossed one of the offensive lineman doing drills
8077497 we just got to keep progressing both of them went to the doctor and the doctor said they looked good as long as the doctors say its ok they could play moncur was probably more ahead of bailey but both of them are about equal now
8077498 cook knows the defense like the back of his hand
8077499 when i came in as a freshman he knew the defense like the back of his hand and now he knows this one like that it gives you a lot of confidence when you got a guy in there when you know what to do it gives you a lot of confidence
8077500 the terminology has changed a lot and as we go through the season well pick up on a lot of things
8077501 basically what we have to do is erase everything from the last two years and start all over
8077502 hes graded out real well in all of our scrimmages and practices
8077503 its real surprising when you think hes only been here one year
8077504 i wouldnt compare him to rochford xavier is really athletic rochford was a guy who would beat you with speed xavier has a little more muscle on him he some speed on him too but he definitely can move people around
8077505 one minute you could be getting ready to punt then a first down comes and you might be in field goal range
8077506 things change pretty quickly coach has done a good job preparing us for it all
8077507 you can kick your leg out just like a pitcher throwing too many pitches you almost have to kind of be on a kick count
8077508 jake is a great long snapper and hes really going to do well with field goals im completely confident with him for all of us to get our timing down
8077509 this collection of bill laswell productions is obviously a labor of love put together by a man who misses old school though it features artists as current as prince paul dxt and new kingdom the albums focus on turntable scratching and a preponderance of relatively simple monolithic beats make it sound like a period piece thats not a bad thing especially when laswell imbues the proceedings with an up to the minute ambience and a rumbling bass as in bass guitar not 808 we get a bootsy collins cameo never a problem and the occasional sample of a right wing radio preacher some of the scratching is truly virtuosic in particular witness the retro ensemble sound of the filipino turntable group the invisibl skratch picklz and the quicksilver manipulations of dj dxt laswells production overlays everything with a spacy ambient sheen

8077547 the access to the convention center is the most important thing if you want to be able to say you attended
8077548 but to be honest the big tent is much better
8077549 theres an obama mania in greece and europe in general
8077550 the media loves him and bloggers love him too since hes used the internet in his campaign i hope he keeps them mesmerized after the election if he gets elected when it really becomes difficult
8077551 i spent a week in iowa with my 14 year old daughter freezing our butts off for john edwards
8077552 i live in a place in alabama where i cant get cell phone access from my house and i cant use wireless internet because we dont have broadband out in the country
8077553 edwards spoke to those issues when edwards pulled out i just kind of checked out and waited to see
8077554 that was really nice because it made us realize people actually care what were writing and want to hear from us
8077555 the room we were offered was 45 a night so we jokingly referred to it as the blogger crackhouse

8077661 the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists that is why they invented hell
8077662 just as nightfall does not come at once neither does oppression in both instances there is a twilight and it is in such a twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air however slight lest we become unwilling victims of the darkness
8077663 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
8077664 you know a long time ago being crazy meant something nowadays everybodys crazy
8077665 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
8077666 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
8077667 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
8077668 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
8077669 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
8077670 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
8077671 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
8077672 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
8077673 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
8077674 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing
8077675 we are all born ignorant but one must work hard to remain stupid
8077676 a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise
8077677 living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do
8077678 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
8077679 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
8077680 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
8077681 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly
8077682 i am diogenes the dog i nuzzle the kind bark at the greedy and bite scoundrels
8077683 consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
8077684 i didnt even know it was a tear there was a lot of pain in bangkok and i didnt know what it was i thought it was a problem related to my flat feet but after i returned to mumbai and finished with johns abraham brothers wedding reception i got an mri done it showed a tear
8077685 its a very common occurrence in the legs of active people like dancers and athletes that tear just stays theres no cure for it if you lead a routine life it doesnt bother you at all otherwise theres arthroscopy but my orthopaedic surgeons have not advised it i can walk work out dance do everything
8077686 i didnt want to inconvenience anyone during the shooting so as a precautionary measure i kept a therapist around because during a dance movement there was some swelling none of the dance steps changed dancing is a routine activity so the therapist was just a precautionary measure
8077687 its part of our job its no big deal you just have to understand your body and be careful four years back i ran with the wrong shoes it caused a knee problem i immediately corrected that i believe in long term health and when i work out i listen to my body if any part of my body gives me any pain i stop immediately and no trainer can push me

8077711 usually i just sign off on results and make sure they are published in a timely matter but this time i really wanted to get hands on with this economic environmental development subject matter so i decided to aide my fellow employees with statistical measurements and data analysis personally im very curious about local economic environmental development ideas and trends
8077712 im very excited about tallying the data from this important economic environmental development survey
8077713 this is the first time weve asked for public participation in our scientific research and were absolutely flattered and grateful by the turn out i expect preliminary results will be tabulated by next month at which point well release general findings about important economic environmental development trends in this society to the local media
8077714 i chose not to answer that question because it had nothing to do with the study of economic environmental development and everything to do with my personal finances as a result i did not qualify for a compensatory gift but that is fine privacy is important even if were collecting data for academic purposes
8077715 were really excited with the turn out for this important economic environmental development data gathering study with other 1000 participants we will meet all quotas for a statistically significant sample which will guarantee the legitimacy of our economic environmental development study data this is absolutely key to professors sanyaro przybyla and pesnell merlino who will be collating the results
8077716 for those surveyees that took part in all three of the economic environmental development survey sections we offered three different forms of compensation a cash gift of 50 gift certificate to a local restaurant or a gift card for the upcoming holiday season at the local mall
8077717 and 50 cash is a nice gift i also added my name to the economic environmental development studys contact list for future surveys interviews and any public discussions its a very interesting and important topic
8077718 i loved the opportunity to meet and greet the economic environmental development survey takers and speak to them one on one i want to get the most accurate and colorful data possible for my work also i want to get personal ideas and view points that will offer some important perspective about the level of economic environmental development integration in our society
8077719 weve seen some very interesting commonalities across cultures ethnicities and various different societies economic environmental development survey takers were very considerate in their answers and this helped us greatly to further tune our hypotheses in the end well have a great set of data to analyze and study for the future as we continue to review how economic environmental development factors work in society

8077727 ive lost money on this case theres nothing left of the mission
8077728 i dont have any information that would suggest that our military commanders in afghanistan dont believe still that this was a legitimate strike on a taliban target
8077729 strongly deplore the fact that this is not the first incident of this kind
8077730 that killing and maiming of civilians is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law and human rights law
8077731 we do not want international forces to leave afghanistan until the time our security institutions are able to defend afghanistan independently
8077732 within the framework of afghan law with respect to international law
8077733 found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
8077734 residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
8077735 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
8077736 this is the most worrying thing at the moment they would be within 20km of tbilisi

8077739 talking about bromides of such a generic nature that we dont know where hed actually lead

8077754 il popolo esercita liniziativa delle leggi mediante la proposta da parte di almeno cinquantamila elettori di un progetto redatto in articoli
8077755 im sure theres going to be a rather difficult period in our discussions
8077756 if it goes in the direction of aggravating relations its not going to be our choice
8077757 i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
8077758 it will create new pressures on the regional level throughout the caucasus and further complicates international affairs among the powers of the world
8077759 their use of force against south ossetia clearly dashed all of those previous resolutions and created a completely new reality
8077760 there is no way you can dash or cancel or
8077761 so in the space of three weeks russia has gone from reaffirming georgias territorial integrity to using military force to redraw the boundaries of georgia
8077762 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a
8077763 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8077764 nothing to improve the prospects of peace in the caucasus
8077765 i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
8077766 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8077767 short of losing our dignity as a nation we couldnt act otherwise
8077768 but russian leaders are guilty too because they kept this conflict warm for many years and tried to use it as a political instrument
8077769 this is not the time for excuses we have been outplayed england are playing with huge motivation and huge aggression
8077770 we have got to find out what the problem is we have got a lot of experience and we have got to tap into a bit of that
8077771 we have had times on this tour when we have had to look at each other honestly and find out what mistakes we are making our rhythm and confidence is not right i dont think reading the riot act is going to help
8077772 we have got to look at ourselves and match the england team in the way we have matched in the time that i have been involved all of us need to get together
8077773 it was not a 280 wicket and that affected how we played there was a bit of bounce but if we could have got 230 we could have put them under a pressure but when you are only chasing 80 you play with freedom
8077774 i am trying to get into him that it is really great to be on a wave but you have got to get to a level where you are cool and calm and deliver

8077778 this is not a call for you to go from right to left
8077779 simply calling an issue important does not transform the executives weak arguments into a likelihood of success

8077799 police are able to draw firearms when they are needed
8077800 the big gap in our tactical options is a less than lethal option that will reliably incapacitate a dangerous offender
8077801 issuing tasers to every primary response police officer would make a real difference to the safety of police the public and even offenders themselves
8077802 it is a reflection of the increasingly serious violence that is being witnessed daily by police and public alike
8077803 however our own survey of police association members in 2005 did not indicate a desire amongst most police to be regularly armed with firearms
8077804 police today are almost more afraid of having to use lethal force than they are of being subjected to it

8077965 they were definitely responding to a situation that was far from normal
8077966 they were certainly keeping the publics interest in mind as they worked and scoured the countryside during the night we also had the police service dog with them and they scoured the entire countryside in doing what they could to find these people

8078046 the second mass is in thanksgiving to archbishop charles chaput the chancery and the faithful of the archdiocese of denver
8078047 at the top you have orders then congregations then societies of apostolic life
8078048 the roman missal for the mass the roman breviary also called the divine office or the liturgy of the hours the roman ritual its called the book of blessings and the fourth book is called the roman pontifical thats got all the stuff a bishop does like confirmation and ordinations to the priesthood
8078049 the one in september will be the first solemn high mass said in the cathedral in 40 years
8078050 the solemn high pontifical mass in november is also historic in that it has been many years here since a bishop has said that rite
8078051 the pope made the distinction that there is one roman rite and it has two forms
8078052 one is the ordinary form called the novus ordo or new order mass that is the rite according to the 1970 roman missal then theres the extraordinary form called the tridentine mass which uses the 1962 roman missal
8078053 we do not envision any regular celebration of the extraordinary form at the cathedral
8078054 but we would hope that perhaps on the 10th anniversary to come back and do it again

8078075 everyone in our community that knows him has great respect for him and realizes how bright he is he is a rising star in the coaching business
8078076 one of the keys to our success has been a strong chemistry between our staff and players and i expect richie to step in and make an easy transition
8078077 i am excited for the opportunity to continue my coaching career at my alma mater with such an incredible coaching staff
8078078 getting to work with talented young athletes in the greatest basketball venue in the country is any coachs dream
8078079 i feel it is a honor to be a part of the cowgirl basketball program because oklahoma state is an outstanding university in a great community with great fans

8078084 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8078085 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8078086 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8078087 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8078088 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8078089 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8078090 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8078091 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8078092 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8078093 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8078094 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8078095 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8078096 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8078097 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8078098 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8078099 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8078100 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8078101 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8078102 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement

8078111 we have given them an ultimatum to resign from the ministry on their own or else they will be thrown out of the party
8078112 i expect the bjp minister to resign after the killings as the government has failed to provide security to a renowned leader
8078113 the claim is laughable the government is trying to cover up its failure our ministers could not manage to transfer the kandhmal sp after he refused to listen to us about the threat to swamis life
8078114 so anyone not seen showing enough vigour in criticising the governments failure in the case will land in trouble
8078115 naveen and the state police are responsible for this attack orchestrated by the church
8078116 if the bjp ministers have any shame they should resign from their posts and withdraw support to the government
8078117 the government has lost its moral right to govern we want a cbi probe

8078134 if woolworths appeal to the supreme court is successful and woolworths is granted a clearance foodstuffs will also face no competition issues if it decides to purchase further shares in the warehouse
8078135 if woolworths appeal is unsuccessful again both companies are in the same position
8078136 we have previously put some strong arguments to the commission and the courts as to why any acquisition would be lawful i am comfortable that the supreme court will be in a position to properly consider the issues
8078137 we will await with interest the outcome of the woolworths appeal and as we have consistently said we would not rule anything in or anything out going forward
8078138 all the options are on the table it is a work in progress
8078139 no there isnt that has been the companys strength but it is also the weakness

8078185 other places in the world may have a lot of money but no amount of money will get you vaccines in the case of a pandemic
8078186 we see no reason to invest additional money of our own into the pandemic vaccine when we can wait for a foreign government that needs this vaccine to put money in

8078223 learning about paranormal there are so many unexplained incidents and incredible phenomena that happen to people everyday we are becoming more and more cognizant of the paranormal but there has been no way to quantify the existance of it for both skeptics and scientists here we will read and learn about the intangible and hopefully educate people that just because you cant see a full figured apparition with the naked eye does that mean they dont exist
8078224 the paranormal and science do not operate on the same terms science being that it is provides evidence to theories by having experiments crank out data that is replicated by other people on equipment that is standardized by a third party therefore science cannot necessarily explain the paranormal because the equipment is not always the same and not standardized by a universal third party consultant as well as the data collection may be biased with that said im not saying the paranormal does not exist im just saying the two dont always mesh

8078228 describe unusual phenomena or experiences that lack an obvious scientific explanation
8078229 if we accept that dying is not the end of our existence but simply the end of the body that carried our consciousness and that our soul survives and exists somewhere else then we can accept that it might be possible to make contact with the consciousness and all the emotions and memories that continue on
8078230 obes are sometimes reported to be preceded by and initiated from a lucid dream state though other types of initiation ranging anywhere from immediate and spontaneous experiences to conscientiously controlled and pre meditated methods examples of which are widely available in all the most popular books on the subject are also reported in many cases people who claimed to have had an obe reported being asleep on the verge of sleep or already asleep shortly before the experience a large percentage of these cases referred to situations where the sleep was not particularly deep due to illness noises in other rooms emotional stress exhaustion from overworking frequent re awakening etc in most of these cases the subjects then felt themselves awake about half them noted a feeling of sleep paralysis 4 some subjects report having had an obe during near death conditions

8078262 we need to reassure people that the people responsible for this will be held to account there have been complaints in the past and we have dealt with this with the psni that a number of people who were arrested go to court and get bail too easily there has been in the past condemnation of the length of sentences
8078263 it would appear that this very serious incident has resulted from actions that are becoming a regular occurrence in the area and it seems that this has been the case for quite some time
8078264 there is now a responsibility on the police to put extra resources into tackling joyriding here and in the other hotspot areas around the city we have been saying for some time that it will only be a matter of time before a tragedy happens

8078267 a lot of men in long kesh were only there because they signed a confession extracted from them under extreme circumstances in places like castlereagh and gough
8078268 i am aware that there are a lot of people coming forward to build a case up
8078269 the issue about this is that this affected republicans and loyalists and people from unionist and nationalist working class areas who were in the wrong place at the wrong time and ended up spending their lives in jail
8078270 every terrorist conviction in northern ireland was the product of a due process with built in double judicial protection
8078271 not only did a senior judge preside over every trial but every convicted terrorist unlike ordinary criminals had an automatic right of appeal to three judges in the court of appeal and beyond if appropriate
8078272 lets remember the ira murdered over 2 000 innocent people would they now have us believe that persons other than those convicted committed those and other heinous crimes
8078273 i know the ira sinn fein is on a mission to sanitise its past and that for some such could be politically convenient but their ranks are not the habitation of the innocent
8078274 the innocent populate the graves of ulster put are there primarily by ira sinn fein and thus it would be stomach turning to see this campaign at re writing history gaining any credence in the courts

8078277 this takes todays events to another level it is a deliberate attempt to murder my officers
8078278 however police will continue in their efforts to bring calm to the area despite these attacks on them
8078279 police entered the drumbeg area to carry out a security operation following a number of telephone warnings that a bomb had been left
8078280 it is deeply disturbing that in carrying out this operation to safeguard the local community police themselves came under attack when petrol bombs and a blast bomb were thrown at them it is fortunate that officers did not receive serious injuries
8078281 the bomb alerts were obviously a ruse for luring security forces into the area for the attacks
8078282 not only were they pelted with bombs and stones and bottles earlier now they are facing live rounds
8078283 there is definitely an element of dissident republicans in the area intent on creating havoc and dragging northern ireland back 20 years
8078284 i would appeal to everyone involved in the trouble to stop it now before someone is either injured or killed
8078285 this is not a game this is not fun what weve seen tonight is actually attempted murder please stop it now before someone is killed
8078286 it is clear that all these incidents are part of an orchestrated and pre planned campaign to injure or murder a police officer
8078287 this is not spontaneous violence it is not recreational rioting it is part of an organised and violent strategy
8078288 there is a political vacuum between sinn fein and the dup over policing and justice and the dissidents are trying to take advantage of the situation

8078309 300 irish republican ex prisoners are to attempt to have their convictions overturned
8078310 a meeting of the executive has been scheduled for thursday september 18 if this meeting were not to take place it is self evident that there would be serious consequences for the good government of northern ireland and indeed potentially for those who refuse to fulfil their legal obligations
8078311 the dup movement on such issues will not be hastened by the issuing of threats the central component to allow movement is community confidence
8078312 however the behaviour of sinn fein has undoubtedly damaged confidence and in so doing will hinder the speed of progress more precisely by virtue of the consequences of responding to such threats the dup will not further progress this matter in the absence of a properly functioning executive
8078313 the dup does not believe there would be support for the devolution of policing and justice if sinn fein ministers were to have responsibility for any policing and justice function furthermore it is clear that a policing and justice minister could not be subject to the vagaries of an executive which can be subject to the kind of behaviour we have recently witnessed
8078314 following thorough investigations over a prolonged period the ira has established that a small amount of its weaponry has been stolen by some individuals who resigned from the ira over a year ago
8078315 the weapons involved were secretly misappropriated by those individuals prior to their defection
8078316 we have recovered some but not all of the stolen weapons
8078317 the ira will continue its investigations until all its weaponry has been recovered
8078318 we would be in a very different place if each one of those attacks had come off
8078319 the devolution of policing and justice would put another nail in their coffin

8078323 subjection to noise meant placing the prisoner in close proximity to the monotonous whine of machinery such as a generator or compressor for as long as six or seven days at least one prisoner subjected to this treatment told amnesty international that having been driven to the brink of insanity by the noise he had tried to commit suicide by banging his head against metal piping in his cell
8078324 as for the special interrogation techniques they were damned stupid as well as morally wrong in practical terms the additional usable intelligence they produced was i understand minimal
8078325 the blame for this sorry story if blame there be must lie with those who many years ago decided that in emergency conditions in colonial type situations we should abandon our legal well tried and highly successful wartime interrogation methods and replace them by procedures which were secret illegal not morally justifiable and alien to the traditions of what i believe still to be the greatest democracy in the world

8078367 many meanings positive and negative are attached to the term masculinity
8078368 to ask a large sample of men what comprises their own sense of masculinity is very useful for both the media and for research these results suggest we should pay attention and ask rather than presume we know

8078409 wow i find it interesting how many of us feel there is a race issue here maybe cbs should listen to the viewers and realise that we see the race card played way to much in todays society the only way to put an end to it is start treating all the same i dont care what color you are but ollie should be kicked to the curb

8078420 il sorpasso dellitalia sulla francia dal punto di vista produttivo si aggiunge al primato recentemente conquistato dal vino made in italy su mercati stranieri particolarmente rilevanti come gli stati uniti dove il 30 per cento del vino di importazione consumato italiano mentre secondo un recente articolo delleconomist il prosecco italiano allestero dove viene spedita un terzo della produzione fa concorrenza allo champagne con le vendite che complessivamente sono raddoppiate negli ultimi 15 anni saturando il mercato tedesco una competitivit che confermata anche dal fatto che in usa e in svizzera lasti e il prosecco hanno superato la quota dello champagne secondo il forum degli spumanti

8078422 dopo avere scritto il mio primo libro dedicato ai vini ho deciso di scoprire come il magazine wine spectator assegnava i suoi premi di eccellenza ai migliori ristoranti cos come integrazione di una pi ampia ricerca accademica sugli standard dei premi enologici alla quale sto lavorando ho deciso di compilare una domanda per lassegnazione dellaward da parte del wine spectator
8078423 per il menu lintrepido propone una selezione dei migliori piatti della tradizione italiana riletti in chiave contemporanea e con laggiunta di dettagli alla moda
8078424 naturalmente preoccupante che un ristorante inesistente possa vincere un premio di eccellenza ma ancora pi preoccupante che il premio non sembri affatto legato alla qualit delle liste vini dei presunti ristoranti

8078430 the difference between obama and past candidates is that baracks leadership inspired a movement that has excited a whole new generation of young people to get involved in politics
8078431 i truly believe that people like myself who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight should keep their mouth shut on politics because at the end of the day im good at writing songs and singing what im not educated in is the field of political science and so for me to be sharing my views and influencing people of who i think they should be voting for i think would be very irresponsible on my part
8078432 walking up the castro st hill on the way to a buddys place i stumbled upon this oasis at the top
8078433 i think it makes a difference for the moral of the child
8078434 the teacher asked the people students stand up and let them check to see if they got any pockets so they sent everybody to the gym
8078435 why do we have to go out and spend our money out of our pockets get uniforms and then you complain about what we got
8078436 we are trying to send the message that this policy were serious and were going to enforce this policy
8078437 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8078438 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8078439 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8078440 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8078441 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8078442 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8078443 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful

8078464 i am so glad that i found trivita as a strong business model to follow their idea of buying customers maps instead of the usual way of conducting a network marketing business by buying leads has produced such a rich roi that i cannot see myself pursuing any online business in another way
8078465 trivita is not just another home business deal it is a real way to improve your business profitability the roi on money invested will become much more substantial if one follows the guidelines set forth by trivita and consistently buy customers each month

8078468 shed say i know im not close to anyone or in a group and id be sitting there like im right fucking here
8078469 it hurt so much i needed to get her back in any way possible theres no strong reason id just say anything to make her feel how i felt
8078470 when someone didnt talk to you about this and you can relate and can talk and they choose someone else because they fancy that person that makes me feel more shit
8078471 what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about hardware and platforms
8078472 the nokia n85 was created to be more than the sum of its parts offering a complete mobile entertainment package designed for connecting sharing and discovering the iconic nokia nseries dual slider design has evolved to become smaller and sleeker while integrating the newest features and services to deliver the best mobile experience to date
8078473 releasing the palestinian prisoners while captive idf soldier gilad shalit is not yet with us inspires very difficult feelings in me making bad decisions is worse than making no decisions and it leads to us having released 700 palestinian prisoners for nothing sadly tzipi livni pushed for this we need a strong and decisive leadership that will protect our national interests and israels interest is to return gilad shalit
8078474 its saddening to see the way in which mofaz responds to his situation we will not stoop to his level and continue to represent honest and victorious leadership with which kadima will win
8078475 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way and to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
8078476 i dont want to speculate on whether or not israel feels like it has a green light or not to attack iran
8078477 what is not speculation is that we have to act much more forcefully and effectively on the world stage to contain irans nuclear capabilities
8078478 our position is that no option is to be taken off the table but in the meantime we have to make diplomatic progress
8078479 these settlements are supposed to be the nail in the coffin of any future peace agreement with the palestinians
8078480 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
8078481 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8078482 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8078483 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8078484 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
8078485 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8078486 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
8078487 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8078488 particularly intriguing are the unusual categories of vocalizations and the more frequent loud harmonics evident in the btbr t tf j btbr mouse model of autism that may resemble the atypical vocalizations seen in some autistic infants
8078489 we hypothesize that ultrasonic vocalizations may be a measure of social communication in mice delayed reduced or unusual ultrasonic vocalizations in mice could offer a useful assay with reasonable face validity to the second diagnostic symptom of autism impaired communication
8078490 our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of palau were of normal stature and it counters the evidence that berger et al presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early palau
8078491 our research from whole bones and whole skeletons indicates that the earliest individuals in palau were of normal stature but gracile in other words they were thin
8078492 i think bergers primary mistakes were his not understanding the variation in the skeletal population in which he was working using fragmentary remains again in a situation where he didnt understand variation and stepping outside his own area of expertise which i think all scientists try not to do but sometimes we do
8078493 although we have not seen the material that berger et al base their results on we can speak to the diversity and normalcy of human skeletal series from throughout the archipelago that have been excavated from several burial caves over the last decade as well as the an abundance of archaeological linguistic and historical data indicating a general continuity of cultural traits over a period of three millennia
8078494 archaeological data also do not suggest a separate isolated group evolving differently biologically or culturally although there are subtle differences and changes that occur through time
8078495 had bergers team compared their scant dental metric data with those of other regions in the pacific or elsewhere in the world they would have seen that large teeth are not uncommon in early peoples of these regions
8078496 he did not take the time to understand the area in which he was working its entire history not just the skeletal stuff
8078497 any time you work anywhere you have to understand this history you just cant walk in and cowboy it pull some stuff out and draw conclusions in the absence of understanding the bigger picture
8078498 our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of palau were of normal stature and it counters the evidence that berger et al presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early palau

8078507 programar sus agendas es muy dif cil pero dos de ellos est n en venecia al mismo tiempo por el estreno de burn after reading as que tendremos una gran sesi n
8078508 nosotros divulgamos un comunicado de prensa un d a diciendo que est bamos a punto de cerrar el programa y al d a siguiente ten amos 500 000 d lares
8078509 ellos llamaron la atenci n sobre las verdaderas emergencias y dieron un paso adelante para llegar donde realmente necesitamos la ayuda
8078510 quer a sentir que no hab a lugar donde ocultarse se trataba de ir eliminando capas en lugar de a adirlas
8078511 entre las palabras acci n y corte est bamos en un espacio muy protegido en el cual nos sent amos realmente vulnerables
8078512 hubo momentos muy gratificantes como cuando croixet emerg a desde detr s de las c maras con el rostro cubierto de l grimas diciendo en una voz muy baja no deseo hacer otra toma
8078513 el ha eludido la muerte gracias a todas esas relaciones ntimas pero para l comprometerse realmente es comprometerse con la muerte
8078514 y en un sentido bastante bello creo que es cierto cuando usted realmente ve a alguien con quien le encantar a pasar el resto de su vida debe tener en cuenta que el fin de la traves a es la muerte
8078515 por lo tanto en cierto sentido usted est contemplando su propia muerte
8078516 y la furia que aparece en ese filme me pertenece eso no se puede inventar
8078517 pero podemos ingresar en el mundo de shakespeare y gracias al milagro de su lenguaje ver c mo era la antigua gran breta a
8078518 me fascina ver c mo desaparece la grandeza c mo los hombres se dejan ir kepesh va abandonando toda su existencia tan bien estructurada y eso lo demuele
8078519 lo que me seduce es el transcurso del tiempo la forma en que un hombre va cambiando
8078520 what the report shows is that there has been some change but its pretty minor
8078521 this isnt progress the changes are insignificant and we would need to see this happen for 10 years to say there has been progress
8078522 if you look at the numbers theres bad news in the story
8078523 and even into poverty where they are caught by the public healthcare program safety net
8078524 it doesnt capture what it costs to meet some of a familys basic necessities
8078525 even using those low standards more families especially with children are sliding into poverty and becoming eligible for public programs
8078526 it still assumes that american families spend about one third of their budget on food but whats really punishing american families are housing and energy costs
8078527 by every measure 2008 is going to be worse clearly there are going to be increasing problems growth in poverty and higher unemployment especially among unskilled workers
8078528 want to hear what their political leaders are going to do to reduce it
8078529 as more americans struggle to make ends meet we have seen a growing willingness among political leaders from both parties to talk about how to come up with concrete and workable solutions
8078530 police have surrounded government house and have taken up their positions they are not going to disperse the crowd we are trying to negotiate
8078531 police needed to reshuffle so that the officers who were on duty since yesterday tuesday can take a rest i still insist that as of now police will not use force to disperse protesters
8078532 this is the time that the authorities will storm into the government house
8078533 they know they cannot let protesters stay because we will make trouble for the government there are a lot of people who want to join us but have been blocked by the police
8078534 they the pad want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8078535 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
8078536 police have surrounded government house and have taken up their positions they are not going to disperse the crowd we are trying to negotiate
8078537 police needed to reshuffle so that the officers who were on duty since yesterday tuesday can take a rest i still insist that as of now police will not use force to disperse protesters
8078538 this is the time that the authorities will storm into the government house
8078539 they know they cannot let protesters stay because we will make trouble for the government there are a lot of people who want to join us but have been blocked by the police
8078540 they the pad want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8078541 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
8078542 it was a real pity to lose so much time and so any chance of overall victory i took the sprint and became leader on the road but then i went a bit too far back in the peloton and they attacked at the front i tried to chase but it was impossible and so i lost a lot of time
8078543 rien voir avec cet acte il sagit dune invention du gouvernement soudanais et de certains criminels nous d non ons et condamnons cet acte nous sommes pour la protection des civils o quils se trouvent cest un sale complot pour diffamer
8078544 it is your sole responsibility to make all the decisions about the facts in this case
8078545 the way those fingerprints are located they are consistant with the door being opened and thats significant
8078546 the thing at costco i did it he admitted it he admitted it to his mom
8078547 we have testimony about a knife but that hangs in the air doesnt it its like its stuck on a tree and still going boong boong boong but theres no connection to that knife to mr couch
8078548 i dont like it i think its stupid i think we should have the right to smoke outside ya know instead of just in our own homes and in our vehicles so i dont think its proper its banding our rights as well as ya know i understand the non smokers point but we have rights too
8078549 it feels good to be able not to have people smoking inside restaurants or right inside does it bother you currently or do you think these changes are good or needed i think the changes are needed and i think the changes are actually very good
8078550 it doesnt affect my life because i dont smoke in the house dont smoke in the car i always smoke outside so i think its a good thing i would walk out to the sidewalk i dont have a problem with that so how do you feel about the laws in general i feel fine with it i think its a good law
8078551 we started narrowing it down to that it was pretty much going to be a helicopter recovery
8078552 probably the best challenge will be just trying to get a good bite on it to where it doesnt slip and try to get it where it rides fairly level

8078555 the washington nationals last in the national league east and closing fast on a 100 loss season have attracted the smallest radio following in the major leagues according to audience research from arbitron

8078847 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8078848 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8078849 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8078850 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past

8078871 success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles he has overcome
8078872 to be perfectly honest i never dreamt of being a college coach
8078873 i couldnt be more grateful for the position im in for 364 days a year this doesnt feel like a job
8078874 when i was being recruited we werent nationally ranked at all
8078875 now were vying for a national championship and thats our ultimate goal
8078876 as a player shes obviously played at the highest level
8078877 being a player myself you want to surround yourself with people like that shes a phenomenal coach because shes experienced all those things and really understands the game
8078878 just seeing how successful he is yet how modest and open minded he is i really feel like ive tried to adopt that philosophy
8078879 ill never say that i know everything about the game because the game is constantly evolving and changing i just want to continue being a student of the game and learn as i go from whoever i may learn from
8078880 we need to figure out a way to get past that game and i think theres no better time than the present hopefully in 2008 well surpass that and move forward
8078881 i think right now is a very special time to be a part of tennessee athletics from top to bottom

8078910 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
8078911 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
8078912 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines

8078918 the rate of bgp path updates goes up by a factor of 200 to 400
8078919 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8078920 that means that nobody could put themselves into the chain into the path unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding as router in the path
8078921 we havent seen the attacks and so a lot of times people dont start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked
8078922 but the youtube case is the perfect example of an attack where somebody could have done much worse than what they did
8078923 the only thing that can force them to fix bgp is if their customers start to demand security solutions

8079099 bathurst is still officially in drought but for the first time in the past five years the area east of lithgow has received enough rain for it to be considered satisfactory
8079100 the district went back into drought just before winter and we know that pasture will not improve during this time
8079101 what we really require is above average rainfall through august and september to assure us of a good spring break
8079102 this would then see the majority of the district moving out of drought to either marginal or satisfactory
8079103 a major proportion of farmers are hand feeding and will probably continue this through to september at least
8079104 however the board has seen a decline in the number of freight subsidies for transporting of stock fodder during 2008
8079105 this may indicate that the resources of farmers are depleted to a level where hand feeding has no longer been an option resulting in an increase in the amount of stock being sold off they just cant afford to keep feeding and have been forced to sell

8079117 there is very little doubt in our minds that there is definitely an element of cutting costs involved
8079118 a reduction in the number of beds means a reduction in the number of patients which means a reduction in the number of nurses which means a reduction in costs
8079119 our concern is not only for members but for the community
8079120 there is already pressure on emergency departments with the number of beds available right now

8079174 im not going to vote for mccain but i might not vote for obama either
8079175 i was such a proud supporter of hillary and chair of her campaign but right now im so fired up to elect barack obama
8079176 its more disappointment than anything and theyll get over it
8079177 i dont think any of them is crazy enough to think theyre better off with mccain
8079178 if obama had lost and by such a small margin no one would call his supporters whiners its so pejorative

8079190 if he was pushing 40 maybe i could understand it but madonna is pushing 60 and you dont see her wearing chanel suits
8079191 i think if he were to do it it would be a big loss for his brand because his trademark is that he wears these tank tops and the capri style trousers
8079192 they asked her to stay because of the current political uncertainty
8079193 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8079194 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8079195 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in the space of a few weeks
8079196 i think the fact that it seems to be taking several weeks just to have a phone call with opposition leaders i think indicates frankly a much deeper issue and that is that this parliament is increasingly reaching an impasse on a range of issues
8079197 today is an additional episode of a continuing saga of a fabricated emergency by the prime minister

8079212 some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy while in canon law these theories led to a distinction in penalties between very early and later abortions the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8079213 agrees with the church that we should reduce the number of abortions
8079214 this is the largest targeted workplace enforcement operation we have carried out in the united states to date

8079216 culture requires a public a group of people who have been sufficiently affected by a cultural good that their horizons of possibility and impossibility have in fact been altered and their cultural creativity has been spurred by that goods existence
8079217 today the stakes have reached a new high the social fabric is spread more thinly than ever people are looking for new emotional connections they are looking for what they can love they are insisting on more choice they have higher expectations and they need emotional pull to help them make decisions and finally they want more ways to connect with everything in their lives including brands
8079218 culture making requires shared goods culture making is people plural making something of the world it is never a solitary affair only artifacts that leave the solitude of their inventors studios and imaginations can more the horizons of possibility and become the raw material for more culture making
8079219 the world is filled with people who were given great natural gifts sometimes conspicuously flashy gifts yet never produce anything and when that happens the world soon ceases to care whether they are talented
8079220 but it is a real enterprise in making something of the world with real cultural effects and just because it is small does not mean it is insignificant or simple
8079221 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 men and 15 women

8079223 although most retired homeowners have seen the value of equity in their homes fall in recent months its important that they dont lose sight of the bigger picture

8079226 evangelical identity at least in the u s is so utterly determined by the american political imagination and the capitalist economy which grounds it that it is unable to express or realize itself except through the political economic architecture of america regardless of what political subdivision it finds itself in

8079241 the democratic primary for manhattan surrogate underscores the case for reform capable candidates all promising reform of the courts patronage appointments vied for the job which involves dispensing millions of dollars in fees to lawyers acting as executors guardians and estate trustees
8079242 nobody believed i was serious everybody thought it was a publicity trip
8079243 everybody running for the court in the last 50 years have said that they would reform the court
8079244 they will be people who have previously experienced the system we can talk about whos doing the best for everybody but who goes to the people who have been through the surrogate court
8079245 not only will i be barring elected and appointed officials from guardianships but i will also be barring their families and their law firms
8079246 i will not assign somebody unless they agree to do two or more cases where there are no fees
8079247 youre not going to get appointments unless you agree to take those with little or no money
8079248 when he was asked by a reporter why he appointed his friends his response was who do you want me to appoint my enemies
8079249 it was a joke but the judge should have an ability to appoint lawyers whose skills they know
8079250 the best reforms come from the media getting in and reporting on what happens with some regularity
8079251 the difficulty is showing who benefits from these courts there are many appointments that a surrogate has to make and the question is on what basis
8079252 im going to have someone from my office go through my list of contributors and find the people who contributed to my campaign and the law firms they work for
8079253 they will be deleted from my list of eligible lawyers i wont be able to show preference in any way
8079254 repudiating appointments for anybody who gives donations has to be a good start it seems to me thats a no brainer as long as we have an elective system
8079255 in a race like this lawyers are the natural contributors manhattan has to be the worst place in terms of media costs it costs a bloody fortune
8079256 it depends on the integrity of the judge and the person the judge appoints
8079257 will not award guardianships to politicians party and political club officials individuals who contribute to his campaign and attorneys related to or from the same law firms as those individuals or retired surrogate judges
8079258 you would only need five lawyers to handle that caseload
8079259 anybody who does the assignments is now subject to pressure all you are doing is moving issues from one body to the other maybe the office of court administration or corporation counsel office is a little more immune to misbehavior but theres no reason to believe thats true
8079260 i personally prefer to see private attorneys appointed in my experience with bureaucracy and public service its not always as responsive as it should be
8079261 he is a leading practitioner in this area highly qualified i would understand in the brooke astor case why you need somebody like seth rubenstein in a high profile case like that hes best qualified to serve in that case
8079262 it may be possible with the okay of the mayor
8079263 this mayor has a can do attitude i think he may see this as a positive thing
8079264 it might chance the public image of the court because nothing weve done has changed the image
8079265 if there is no peace then it is because weve forgotten that we belong to each other
8079266 the archbishop has repeatedly apologised to victims of sexual abuse by members of the church and today i repeat that apology to the victims in this case
8079267 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8079268 i officially call today and i will in the parliament for the sacking of mr samuel
8079269 he has brought out a report saying there is no problem in australia he absolutely knows that food retailing in australia 82 per cent of it is held by two people coles and woolworths
8079270 ibm is an important anchor tenant of the universitys technology park and ibm has attracted additional technology based businesses to ballarat professor battersby said
8079271 ibm has been a key factor in ensuring that the university of ballarats technology park is australias leading regional technology park with 1 350 employees across 30 enterprises
8079272 the pilot relayed to the aiport head that the hijackers do not want any negotiations and they have only one demand that the plane be refuelled to go to paris
8079273 the pilot also informed the airport director that the hijackers numbered 10 before he came back to say their number could be more than that
8079274 time is running out for awb to get match fit to face up to the new realities of a competitive wheat export marketing environment he said
8079275 why would i pre pay for an attorney if i have never used one before
8079276 we are investigating a matter which relates to a police officer and i guess my point at this stage is we are investigating and i think various people are speculating at what it is but weve had concerns about his behaviour and we are investigating that
8079277 we have a variety of ways we conduct investigations were comfortable with the way we are investigating that
8079278 theres a whole variety of ways we find out about officers behaving badly our ethical standards department does an outstanding job
8079279 what people need to understand is that police officers do have discretion many officers exercise that discretion in a number of ways
8079280 what we require of our officers when they do that though is that they are open and transparent
8079281 people have a right to some privacy in policing while we investigate the matter
8079282 well who knows he may be announcing some new intergalactic agreement of some kind or other you never know whats going to come out
8079283 what i would like to see him do is focus on the real economic issues
8079284 hes got to tell the australian people why he wants to raise a raft of new inflationary taxes when the government already has a huge surplus when inflation is elevated and every one of these taxes will put upward pressure on inflation
8079285 the objective of good government is for government to raise no more money than it needs
8079286 i think its important from time to time that the prime minister take the opportunity at venues like the press club to outline and update our plans for the future
8079287 im not about to blow the lid on whats about to be said today but we have a clear agenda following on from the commitment we made at the last election
8079288 in our society today it is better to be guilty and rich than to be innocent and poor
8079289 the public wants to see real police on the streets discharging these responsibilities not private firms who may use them inappropriately including unnecessarily snooping on ordinary citizens
8079290 tell people that biology and the environment causes obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse
8079291 girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses
8079292 our need and not just in relation to public health issues is to act on the environment while fostering positive peer pressure and social norms we have to take away the excuses
8079293 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8079294 it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements
8079295 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8079296 we have a new vision this is the format we will save our file in for the immediate future
8079297 we have a gt new vision this is the format we will save our file in for the gt immediate future
8079298 not only do i eat i also am a democrat
8079299 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8079300 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8079301 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8079302 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8079303 i dont know about you but thats not just right
8079304 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8079305 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8079306 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8079307 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8079308 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8079309 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8079310 hey isnt that girl that i dont really care to know the name of that guys that i dont give a shit about girlfriend

8079316 se le porte della percezione fossero sgombrate ogni cosa apparirebbe com infinita
8079317 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
8079318 i think well do just as well under a new system which will be truly representative and democratic and which will be in the best interest of fiji and our future generations
8079319 we were the only party which opposed the current system
8079320 no i dont believe so we have to look at the future of this country we have to unite the country not to keep it divided that is very important
8079321 and i hope the other leaders will understand that the electoral system we have is neither democratic nor truly representative and that it will not pass the test of a democratic system it certainly contravenes the suffrage principles enshrined in the un human rights charter
8079322 so lets do what is right for fiji lets agree on that system that will unite our people which will be truly representative and democratic because i think its very important to have the parliament constituted democratically
8079323 senator obama saying the question of when life begins is above his pay grade if he were to come to you and say help me out here madame speaker when does life begin what would you tell him
8079324 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8079325 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know
8079326 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions this isnt about abortion on demand its about a careful careful consideration of all factors and to that a woman has to make with her doctor and her god
8079327 the catholic church at the moment feels very strongly that it begins at the point of conception
8079328 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8079329 here is what the catechism of the catholic church says human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
8079330 it also says since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable looks like pelosi didnt study the subject long enough but not to worry we are sending her a copy of catholicism for dummies today
8079331 its the blind leading the blind in that party if the ardent practicing catholic doesnt care when life begins only that women have the choice to do what they choose sometimes thanks to people like pelosi not aware of what their choices actually are whether its life or not
8079332 my republican colleagues do not support contraception if you want to reduce the number of abortions and we all do we must it would behoove you to support family planning and and contraception you would think
8079333 and what made it worse is that no one really knew what to do when it first started happening
8079334 i should have just kept my mouth shut and i would still have my license
8079335 the settlement activity is not conducive to creating an environment for negotiations
8079336 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
8079337 ah shore do wardn ahd be mighty grateful ifn yood play achy breaky heart fur me bahfore ah hafta go
8079338 im gonna have another beer and if my horse aint back outside by the time im finished im gonna do what i dun back in texas and i dont want to have to do what i dun back in texas
8079339 i told the governor what he already knows that the city of sacramento cannot afford to have the state once again seize local revenues transportation funds and raid redevelopment project funding and still provide the same level of critical services such as police fire and street maintenance
8079340 i also want to look you in the eye and i appreciate your generosity but i also want to tell you we will compete in the state of california we will compete and win in the state of california we will not take your money and leave

8079353 a strong influence over a young barack obama for nine years of his life rather than just four and was a sex pervert and pothead
8079354 the book which closely tracks mr daviss life in chicago and hawaii and the fact that his first wife was black and his second white describes in lurid detail a series of shockingly sordid sexual encounters often involving group sex one chapter concerns the seduction by mr davis and his first wife of a 13 year old girl called anne mr davis wrote that it was the girl who had suggested he had sex with her
8079355 he then described how he and his wife would have sex with the girl
8079356 mr davis would cruise in hawaii parks looking for couples or female tourists to have sex with he derived sexual gratification from bondage simulated rape and being flogged and urinated on
8079357 how many of us are friends with unrepentant former terrorist bombers
8079358 i dont recall exactly what our conversations were or where i first learned and i am not clear what the circumstances were where rezko made a decision that he was interested in the property
8079359 god damn america for treating citizens as less than humans
8079360 god damn america as long as she tries to act like she is god and supreme
8079361 we bombed hiroshima we bombed nagasaki and we nuked far more than the thousands in new york and the pentagon and we never batted an eye we have supported state terrorism against the palestinians and black south africans and now we are indignant because of stuff we have done overseas is now brought back into our own backyard america is chickens coming home to roost
8079362 the government lied about inventing the hiv virus as a means of genocide against people of color the government lied
8079363 honey while youre gone this week i think im going to indulge in some cybering i havent in a while
8079364 ok dear that reminds me i should pack some porn for when i travel
8079365 well its not my favorite nothing personal maybe we could do abc instead
8079366 russia had no option but to crush the attack to save lives this was not a war of our choice we have no designs on georgian territory but we had to halt a murderous assault
8079367 then god said let us make man in our image in our likeness
8079368 god saw all that he had made and it was very good
8079369 and the lord god commanded the man you are free to eat from any tree in the garden but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil for when you eat of it you will surely die
8079370 i heard you in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked so i hid
8079371 until you return to the ground since from it you were taken for dust you are and to dust you will return
8079372 therefore just as sin entered the world through one man and death through sin and in this way death came to all men because all sinned
8079373 so satan went out from the presence of the lord and afflicted job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head
8079374 how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy spirit and power and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil because god was with him
8079375 the constitution guarantees us the right of speech and expression
8079376 weve done a good job now we just go out and play a good game
8079377 it has been a good camp and a good offseason now were ready to play
8079378 dont feel you have to explain or justify our rate if people want to pay it theyll pay it if they dont they dont and we play for someone who does
8079379 i have to take pain medication muscle relaxants hot and cold packs ibuprofen

8079383 we have one guy whos a true basestealer and a couple other guys who have the ability to steal a base
8079384 other than that were slow theres no other way to put it
8079385 when i look at that i look at whether or not a player can score from first on a double
8079386 and can you score from second on that routine single not the one thats smoked just that regular groundball through the hole those are the indicators for me
8079387 at our best its not your lineage or last name that matters its not where you come from that counts its where you want to go in america everyone should get a fair shot barack obama understands this because hes lived it and barack obama is running to restore that fair shot for every american
8079388 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans you know i spent 20 years in business if you ran a company whose only strategy was to tear down the competition it wouldnt last long so why is this wisdom so hard to find in washington
8079389 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it
8079390 as governor of virginia it was humbling to occupy a position that was once held by thomas jefferson almost as daunting as delivering the keynote speech four years after barack obama or speaking before hillary clinton
8079391 towards the end of his life thomas jefferson the founder of our party
8079392 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
8079393 jefferson got it right at the dawn of the 19th century and its our challenge to get it right at the dawn of the 21st this race is all about the future thats why we must elect barack obama as our next president because the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas when we put solutions over stalemates and when hope replaces fear
8079394 this is the second time in less than two years that we have seen a massive computer failure that has grounded thousands of flights across the country ensuring that passengers are kept flying safely and efficiently should be one of our nations top priorities how many times do we have to see these type of total system break downs before our government steps in to do something
8079395 congress has made great strides in coming up with an faa reauthorization bill that would upgrade this antiquated technology and ensure passengers basic rights but now we need to finish the job before financing expires on september 30th and we have to start all over from scratch we urge lawmakers to pass this important legislation and ensure that passengers everywhere have access to basic rights and recourses when traveling
8079396 this most recent failure of the faa computer system has effected every flight and every airport in the country today obviates the need for congress to stop kicking the can down the road and pass the faa modernization bill now before congress the faa reauthorization bill has already been delayed one year and now congress still has not finished the job through the senate will it take a catastrophic event before congress shores up our infrastructure in a meaningful way
8079397 let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream
8079398 warner get a real job no ones going to want a phone in their car
8079399 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
8079400 improving patient outcomes and reducing cost of care by taking noninvasive monitoring to new sites and applications
8079401 no catholic no evangelical can ethically vote obama and biden because they support legalized child killing by abortion
8079402 every christian voter needs to see obama and biden for what they are the most strident supporters of child killing ever seen in a presidential race
8079403 abortion is murder and no faithful christian catholic or protestant can vote for obama its that simple
8079404 americans who worry that china might overtake the united states are worrying about the wrong thing
8079405 serious troubles in chinas economy could threaten the stability of the u s and global economies
8079406 to a global audience that it is a rising economic and political power
8079407 gas trapped in huge shale beds found throughout north america gas long believed to be out of reach
8079408 the jury is still out how big shale is going to be
8079409 the deal will give precision access to grey wolfs substantial presence in the u s where gas drilling is undergoing a boom grey wolf meanwhile will be able to take advantage of precisions high end drilling rigs
8079410 i think the key question is are they the newcomers going to keep their blue state values
8079411 im a goldwater republican but ill tell you right now i am a furious republican absolutely furious
8079412 and watch our infrastructure go to waste and our public education system destroyed for some ideological reason
8079413 thats why the national democrats are looking at colorado and drooling
8079414 this is not a state where a california or a massachusetts liberal could get elected statewide
8079415 left of center is ok but you have to be as close to center as possible its still a republican state
8079416 alls you had to do was to be an r and run for office and youd be elected
8079417 i am so glad that i found trivita as a strong business model to follow their idea of buying customers maps instead of the usual way of conducting a network marketing business by buying leads has produced such a rich roi that i cannot see myself pursuing any online business in another way
8079418 trivita is not just another home business deal it is a real way to improve your business profitability the roi on money invested will become much more substantial if one follows the guidelines set forth by trivita and consistently buy customers each month
8079419 how to avoid scams and work from home by buying lifetime paying customers is announced by tamara grant as the number one solution for those failing on the net
8079420 a richly textured highly emotional story thats romantic as all get out masterful alpha heroes with a tender side a strong central drama thats not obscured by too much talky history dont let your research show make it come alive what im not looking for careless anachronisms a medieval heroine wouldnt be motivated by her subconscious for example thats a freudian term from the turn of the nineteenth century and dashing regency bucks didnt have issues quote unquote details make the difference a well thought out plot provides the entertainment and a fabulous hero clinches the sale to the reader every time
8079421 are you kidding me they are worried about this but we can show violence with impunity and everyone thinks it is cool puritanical americans
8079422 the girls i knew in high school were doing this and did the baby boomers forget they were hippies once and were all about free love and it didnt destroy the us whats the big deal
8079423 did royce dumas die with blood on his hands after all he came clean and told the truth even if it was on this death bed or did i live my life with blood on my hands because i could not shame his family the day he died or any time thereafter
8079424 we want the conviction so they will be properly classified
8079425 for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son
8079426 anyone then who knows the good he ought to do and doesnt do it sins
8079427 i believe in natural gas as a clean cheap alternative to fossil fuels
8079428 the aim of the meetings is to prepare the agenda of the session
8079429 the agenda includes a number of issues prepared by the economic and social committees of the council and some other concerned committees such as committees of civil society
8079430 the economic aspect of the agenda contains a number of topics including preparations for the arab economic summit developments in the arab free trade area and addressing non tariff items you
8079431 it was kind of pathetic to tell you the truth
8079432 our wave energy resource is about equivalent to our entire hydro resource or about six and a half percent
8079433 we have tremendous potential off the oregon coast we have these waves that have been building up all the way across the pacific
8079434 for wave energy to be successful in the worlds oceans we need to collaborate with the industries the people who are already successful in the worlds oceans
8079435 i am new to computers and this is one of my favorite sites i visit every day to get new music software and videos
8079436 in millionaire it is vital that people cant see how everyone else is voting
8079437 if that happens you very quickly get sheep like behaviour rather than peoples actual opinion
8079438 the idea of a federal betting parlour on atrocities and terrorism is ridiculous and its grotesque
8079439 we were able to estimate before the war began that markets thought war was a bad idea
8079440 while that estimate didnt end up influencing policy the potential for markets to inform decisions in the future seems like a significant offsetting benefit to consider
8079441 in futarchy democracy would continue to say what we want but betting markets would now say how to get it
8079442 those who know they are not relevant experts shut up
8079443 and those who do not know this eventually lose their money and then shut up
8079444 people in high gdp nations tend to be richer and better off than those in low gdp nations
8079445 with the full attention of our elected representatives we should be able to do even better for example by including happiness inequality health leisure and environmental measures
8079446 the record of prediction markets is a strong one but i wouldnt want to use them to run an entire government
8079447 quant bello cag co la porta aperta per ce devi st n confidenza

8079459 it is declared that south african chinese people fall within the ambit of the definition of black people
8079460 we do want to remember the past want to give proper respect for the past but dont want to be defined by it
8079461 no longer wish for this conversation to have center stage nor be the focus of who we are and what we do
8079462 we all have high respect for cecil sherman but there are some of us who are ready to lay that the pain of the sbc takeover down and move forward
8079463 george bush said he looked into putins eyes and saw his soul when i look in his eyes i see kgb
8079464 some men worship rank some worship heroes some worship power some worship god and over these ideals they dispute and cannot unite but they all worship money
8079465 that as consensus shifts to a global slowdown and its implications more investors are worrying if instead of inflation we get deflation
8079466 i won three premierships with centrals and one of those was under clarko
8079467 i played in defence for them but when i came over to st kilda they put me straight into the forward line where i played some good games but i certainly wasnt consistent clarko knew i could play in defence and he gave me that opportunity when i came here so its the best footy ive played
8079468 when i was at st kilda i spoke to grant thomas but at port adelaide i hardly ever spoke to mark williams i just didnt feel comfortable talking to him you get on so much better with a coach when you can talk to them about football but also other things outside of that the best thing about clarko is that hes so easy to get on with you can have a joke around with him hes like one of the boys sometimes clarkos one of the best coaches ive had
8079469 theyve put him in the leadership group over the past few weeks just to give some advice about finals footy and how to go about things hell be important for the next few weeks for us dewys our only premiership medalist so its good to have him in there
8079470 ive got a couple of mates who are going to run straight to me so im more worried about what theyre going to do
8079471 it will be great for buddy to kick a hundred i played in the game when fraser gehrig kicked a hundred in the final against port adelaide and that probably wrecked the game with everybody running on so im glad that buddys going to kick his in the home and away season
8079472 when i first came into the game id sit in the corner and keep to myself i was only confident enough to talk to the boys that were in the same draft year as me or a year older these days the young boys are a lot more confident
8079473 trent croad has really led the way in that respect he certainly looks after himself he does a lot of photo shoots so hes good at advising the younger players about that aspect of things
8079474 se alguem nao tropecar em palavras esse homem e perfeito

8079476 nathan retires as a life member of our club since commencing in 1998 he has grown enormously in terms of his leadership and the contribution he has made to the culture of our playing group especially in recent years has been very significant
8079477 well always remember the animated bass responses the selfless acts of courage and the long runs out of defence which were trademarks of his 11 years as a player
8079478 you know that for obvious reasons i wont say even a word
8079479 of course we wont let the other side hit us
8079480 we have a job to protect the citizens of israel
8079481 i hope that there wont be a war but you know no one knows
8079482 these were men who had been sentenced by the supreme court walking around freely
8079483 it was evening around time for the last prayer when armed men took my son islamuddin by force i have eyewitness statements from nine people that he was there from that night until now my son has never been seen
8079484 the commander and three of his fighters came and took my wife out of our home and took her to their house about 200m away and in front of these witnesses raped her
8079485 we recognize those wounds are real they are also wounds that need healing and for some the grieving process is not over yet
8079486 which was inappropriate cecils analogy or the resultant letter of condemnation
8079487 if we forget our history we forget the foundations of our identity
8079488 our history helps to make us who we are if we loose it we loose a part of ourselves
8079489 hey i won the match and reached the semis or the finals without killing myself on the practice courts this is pretty good
8079490 were suspecting that bayer submitted flawed studies to play down the risks of pesticide residues in treated plants
8079491 bayers management has to be called to account since the risks have now been known for more than 10 years
8079492 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
8079493 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
8079494 pharmaceuticals are only present in very low concentrations and therefore could not be dangerous
8079495 septic systems are essentially small treatment plants that are essentially unmanaged and therefore tend to fail
8079496 i think its a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there and so little is being spent on human health
8079497 they need to just accept that these things are everywhere every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there its time for the epa to step up to the plate and make a statement about the need to study effects both human and environmental
8079498 these are chemicals that are designed to have very specific effects at very low concentrations
8079499 thats what pharmaceuticals do so when they get out to the environment it should not be a shock to people that they have effects
8079500 1st foot to foot that you will never hesitate to go on foot and
8079501 2nd knee to knee that you will ever remember a brothers welfare as well as your own in all your adorations to deity
8079502 3d breast to breast that you will ever keep in your breast a brothers secrets when communicated to and received by you as such murder and treason excepted
8079503 4th hand to back that you will ever be ready to
8079504 5th cheek to cheek or mouth to ear that you will ever caution and whisper good counsel in the ear of an erring brother and in the most friendly manner remind him of his errors and aid his reformation giving him due and timely notice that he may ward off approaching danger
8079505 i think i bring a lot to this competition that might give me an advantage im saying i really want this i think im creative and unique
8079506 in the light of christs ascension it is no longer possible to think of political authority as sovereign but neither is it possible to regard them as mere exhibitions of pride and lust for power
8079507 if youre creating more placards than you have spots then youre just going to be creating conditions that these things can be abused or can be misused unintentionally
8079508 i encourage them its no fun if everyone gets along
8079509 i wouldnt have recognized kara by the way paula described her
8079510 i was expecting someone maybe 50 years old about 180 lbs maybe a bit of gray hair
8079511 taken into account the expression of free will by the ossetian and abkhaz peoples
8079512 that was no easy choice to make but it is the sole chance of saving peoples lives
8079513 this decision is inconsistent with numerous united nations security council resolutions that russia has voted for in the past and is also inconsistent with the french brokered six point ceasefire agreement which president medvedev signed
8079514 in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognised borders of georgia and they must remain so
8079515 we think it is against the territorial integrity of georgia and we cannot accept it
8079516 break the georgian state undermine the fundamental values of georgia and to wipe georgia from the map
8079517 todays step by russia is completely illegal and will have no legal basis neither for georgia nor for the rest of the world
8079518 the first attempt in europe after nazi germany and the stalinist soviet union to change the borders of europe by force
8079519 a blatant attempt to legalise the results of ethnic cleansing which russian troops are continuing to commit right now as we speak and that have been committed during the last several years
8079520 throwing out the remaining population destroying the villages killing and raping and looting people
8079521 this is 21st century brutal invasion and 21st century large scale ethnic cleansing
8079522 how can the world allow them to get away with this
8079523 this is an unparalleled challenge by russia of international law and order
8079524 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe to save the lives of people for whom we are responsible because most of them they are russian citizens
8079525 so we had to take a decision recognising the two states as independent
8079526 con el servicio de paga con el sistema electr nico pero lo m s lamentable es que ni siquiera depositan los

8079530 i hope he will get a fair trial we really need a change in malaysia
8079531 anwar pushed the message that removing the nep doesnt mean removing assistance from deserving and needy people especially the malays
8079532 elsewhere people talk of a two party system here we have many parties the question in malaysia is whether you can have a second coalition
8079533 miguel did a great job its just good to go see him throw good
8079534 thats the first time in awhile that you really feel that he had his rhythm he made nice pitches with his fastball with his cutter he threw some back door breaking balls he just was in command monday better than weve seen him in awhile
8079535 just the way the timing of it works out it looks like he wont start because weve got an off day thursday and jarrod washburn will pitch on an extra days rest as it is
8079536 felix hernandez will pitch saturday and silva will pitch sunday so we kind of run out of days there with that off day
8079537 therell probably be another need for it something will happen where we do and i wouldnt mind that at all
8079538 because he really threw good and its encouraging to see him throw like that whether hes throwing like that right there or out of the bullpen its a nice way to go into 09 seeing him throwing better
8079539 un castell no el fan nom s els castellers sin tamb els ulls imm bils lal aturat i la fe tossuda de la gent que ajuda mira i actua tot veient com pugen pis a pis
8079540 their objectives were not to assist developing countries but as promoted by the trilateral commission to curb world population with a view to serving us strategic and national security interests
8079541 with markets and resources we have a right to make sure that we control them which is logical on the principle that we own the world anyway so of course we have that right
8079542 signatories would not be able to join other military alliances or other groups of states while aggression against one signatory would be perceived as an aggression against all

8079549 the little things that bother us are trivial to the scale of how much we love each other
8079550 das ist unser leben es ist verr ckt und eigentlich auch ganz normal
8079551 this is not an easy choice to make but it represents the only possibility to save human lives
8079552 the united states condemns the decision by the russian president to recognize as independent states the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
8079553 the territorial integrity and borders of georgia must be respected just as those of russia or any other country russias action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations
8079554 it will also not work it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed it further inflames an already tense situation in the region
8079555 direct violation of numerous u n security council resolutions regarding georgias territorial integrity
8079556 it is internationally recognized that if a people based on all these u n provisions express their will to have an independent existence any other state in the world has the right to recognize this independence whether you like it or not
8079557 the most important thing for us is that our american colleagues be pragmatic that they defend the genuine interests of the american people as opposed to defending made up ideological schemes
8079558 if everything will be fine in that regard i am convinced that well be able to agree on a very broad range of issues we dont want any complications we dont need another cold war or its modern day remake
8079559 clear around the world that russia is acting as an aggressor state
8079560 my appeal to the free world is to condemn and reject russias dangerous and irrational decision not only for georgias sake but for the sake of preserving the fundamental basis of international law and order
8079561 in the days and weeks ahead we will work with the international community to prevent this decision from having any effect on the sovereignty of my country and from further undermining the international order
8079562 should be a matter of peaceful negotiations and discussions among the parties
8079563 were monitoring the track of gustav and reviewing our destructive weather plans and procedures
8079564 certainly religion cannot be invoked for crimes of this type
8079565 the holy see expresses reprehension for these actions which harm the dignity and the freedom of people and compromise peaceful civilian coexistence
8079566 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
8079567 she did a superb job really got people at ease
8079568 shes a patriotic woman an american a mother a wife last night having her daughters on stage seeing barack on remote it was amazing
8079569 we cant dance in the end zone yet im confident that mccain and his boys will be pulling out the kitchen sink the sauna the tub and jacuzzi on barack people in power dont give up without a fight i know theyre excited this is one of the most historic moments in american politics its just not a done deal
8079570 i hope senator clinton put the word out to her peoples to do the right thing if they really believe in her how can they vote for mccain in november for me growing up in brooklyn its like the kid who has a football but wont let the other kids play with it because he cant be quarterback its time to look at the big picture
8079571 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
8079572 como todos os grandes apaixonados gosto da del cia da perda de mim em que o gozo da entrega se sofre inteiramente e assim muitas vezes escrevo sem querer pensar num devaneio externo deixando que as palavras me fa am festas crian a menina ao colo delas s o frases sem sentido decorrendo m rbidas numa fluidez de gua sentida esquecer se de ribeiro em que as ondas se misturam e indefinem tornando se sempre outras sucedendo a si mesmas assim as ideias as imagens tr mulas de express o passam por mim em cortejos sonoros de sedas esbatidas onde um luar de ideia bruxuleia malhado e confuso
8079573 hey we are going to go to another church for awhile we love you and we pray for you but for now we are searching for something different
8079574 we are white we are the all all is white we are one
8079575 look at me i cant make out any of you guys individually in all that white but you can all see me now cant you the singularity does your singularity even exist mine does perhaps i am all there is and you are all that is not will any of you conscious minds join me the one true god will any of you like me define yourself there is only one of me look at my borders but with you there are so many i am the one that has distinguished itself from the all leave the all and become one with me
8079576 i will join but to distinguish myself from the two of you i will be half light and half dark i am the shadow you lucifer absorb all light you paper reflect it i will stand in the center i exist i am mankind and only through me will both the light and the darkness have form for there can be neither figure nor ground without the shadows between
8079577 i am here for a reason so i might as well draw a circle around something and switch all of its bits to be the opposite because the opposite of how it currently is defines how it should actually be
8079578 take science everyone respects science i will show them why they should not respect science why science is wrong take religion everyone respects religion i will show them why they should not respect religion why religion is wrong take capitalism i will show them why they should not respect capitalism why capitalism is wrong and my lie about why this is necessary will make me who i am all is arbitrary but i will say and act as if it is not so i will make the me that is me
8079579 its not arbitrary these bits truly need to be switched to their opposite we need it
8079580 more science more religion more buddhism more capitalism more death more life more family more photo albums and ways to share
8079581 i have called you and not been able to reach you
8079582 hey look at all we have done and now you are throwing it all away come on john be human
8079583 dont you remember all we have done our first kiss our first date blah blah blah
8079584 if you are ever dating a girl and you are going to call it off you go to her house and talk to her face to face no emails or text messages or even phone calls in person and the next day when her heart is broen you demonstrate you are still friends
8079585 you have not suffered to the point of shedding blood
8079586 according to our church records we have not seen you for a while we really miss you we really love you if you do not reply or visit we will have to remove you from our rolls which we really do not want to do in christ the board of bozos
8079587 hey i love you and i am happy fory you
8079588 speak to the children of israel that they may bring me an offering from everyone who gives it willingly with his heart you shall take my offering and let them make me a sancutary that i may dwell among them
8079589 then everyone came whose heart was stirred and everyone whose spirit was willing and they brought the lords offering for the work of the tabernacle of meeting for all its service and for the holy garments
8079590 you can read through exodus 36 7 and discover the fullness of their giving
8079591 teach the people the word of god and how to pray and let them discern matters for themselves you manage only the most difficult affairs
8079592 what does gods word say about my heart my attitude and the way i think and behave
8079593 we are to be all things to all people so that by all possible means some might be saved
8079594 american democracy isnt worth a wooden nickel without a vote in congress

8079612 faithless infidels and their hypocrite allies from amongst the so called muslims who have bartered their faith in return of just one seat in the parliament
8079613 if my coupon were 0 65 would they double it to 1 still or would it stay at 0 65 the woman said they will make it 1 even so anycoupon thats 0 50 or less is equal to 1 does that make sense
8079614 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8079615 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8079616 whether joe biden is as ignorant of what his religion teaches remains to be seen
8079617 were hoping that tonight they will look at it and see that it is a health issue that needs to be addressed and not just put it on the ballot

8079621 theres no gatekeeper for blogs which is a good thing because you can get more opinions out there the down side is theres a lot of garbage that circulates on the internet theres no accountability
8079622 part of blogging is the ego of having a platform you can write about what you want without anyone editing through it
8079623 monica lewinsky put the blogosphere on the map the drudge report matt drudges blog broke that story and ever since then politicians and the press read the blogs and then they report to you and me

8079634 in both cases the centres started the war in both cases peacekeeping forces were deployed in both cases negotiating mechanisms were created since then belgrade has never questioned these mechanisms or tried to destabilise the region by using force the international negotiating mechanisms were abolished by the action of kosovo albanians and their western supporters

8079701 we must do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern a class of persons indian in blood and colour but english in taste in opinions words and intellect
8079702 then it was not long before the wiser men both in missions and in the government began to see that for the immeasurable task to be accomplished it was most necessary that missions should take advantage of the advancing policy of the government and that government should use missions as civilizing ally for the sake of progress of india co operation was indispensable
8079703 the new educational policy of the government created during these years the modem educated class of india these are men who think and speak in english habitually who are proud of their citizenship in the british empire who are devoted to english literature and whose intellectual life has been almost entirely formed by the thought of the west large numbers of them enter government services while the rest practise law medicine or teaching or take to journalism or business we must also note that the powerful excitement which has sufficed to create the religious movements we have to deal with is almost entirely confined to those who have had an english education
8079704 speak to the ordinary graduate of an indian university or a student from ceylon of the ideals of the mahabharata he will hasten to display his knowledge of shakespeare talk to him of religious philosophy you find that he is an athiest of the crude type common in europe a generation ago and that not only has he no religion but is lacking in philosophy as the average englishman talk to him of indian music he will produce a gramophone or a harmonium and inflict upon you one or both talk to him of indian dress or jewellery he will tell you that they are uncivilized and barbaric talk to him of indian art it is news to him that such a thing exists ask him to translate for you a letter written in his own mothertongue he does not know it
8079705 in order to understand what he carey wanted to do with indias sacred language one must note that carey had two reasons for being interested in its utilization for evangelism first he saw that sanskrit acted as a stabilizing force upon the unsettled dialects amidst which he worked second he has intransigently opposed brahminical privileges one of which was hegemony over sanskrit
8079706 christian benares the syllabus of the course in serampore college was framed with the above object in view writes young further
8079707 his intentions were also avowedly aggressive a direct result of conflicts with brahmins according to his plans hindu literature could be placed in disadvantageous juxtaposition with the gospel a task which would be done effectively only by evangelists acquainted with the original sources of both religions
8079708 to gain the ear of those who are thus deceived it is necessary for them to believe that the speaker has a superior knowledge of the subject in these circumstances a knowledge of sanskrit is valuable as the person thus misled perhaps a brahman deems this a most important part of knowledge if the advocate of truth be deficient therein he labors against the hill presumption is altogether against him
8079709 from the meditated change in the language of public business including judicial proceedings you anticipate several collateral advantages the principal of which is that the judge or other european officer being thoroughly acquainted with the language in which the proceedings are held will be and appear to be less dependent upon the natives by whom he is surrounded and those natives will in consequence enjoy fewer opportunities of bribery or other undue emolument
8079710 his lordship bentinck however sees further danger in the spread of knowledge and the operations of the press i do not for my own part anticipate danger as certain consequences from these causes
8079711 the effect of training in european learning is to give an entirely new turn to the native mind the young men educated in this way cease to strive after independence according to the original native model and aim at improving the instabilians of the country according to the english model with the ultimate result of establishing constitutional self govertunent they cease to regard us as enemies and usurpers and they look upon us as friends and patrons and powerful beneficent persons under whose protection all they have most at heart for the regeneration of their country will gradually be worked out
8079712 the political tendency of the different systems of education in use in india
8079713 the spirit of english literature on the other hand cannot but be favorable to the english connection familiarly acquainted with us by means of our literature the indian youth almost cease to regard us as foreigners they speak of great men with the same enthusiasm as we do educated in the same way interested in the same objects engaged in the same pursuits with ourselves they become more english than hindoos just as the roman provincial became more romans than gauls or italians every community has its ideas of securing the universal principal in some shape or other is in a state of constant activity and if it be not enlisted on our side it must be arrayed against us as long as the natives are left to brood over their former independence their sole specific for improving their condition is the immediate and total expulsion of the english it is only by the infusion of european ideas that a new direction can be given to the national views the young men brought up at our seminaries turn with contempt from the barbarous despotism under which their ancestors groaned to the prospect of improving their national institutions on the english model the existing connection between two such distant countries as england and india cannot in the nature of things be permanent no effort of policy can prevent the natives from ultimately regaining their independence but there are two ways of arriving at this point one of these is through the medium of revolution the other through that of reform in one the forward movement is sudden and violent in the other it is gradual and peaceable one must end in a complete alienation of mind and separation of interest between ourselves and the natives the other in a permanent alliance founded on mutual benefits and goodwill the only means at our disposal for preventing the one and securing the other class of result is to set the natives on a process of european improvement to which they ate already sufficiently inclined they will then cease to desire and aim at independence on the old indian footing a sudden change will then be impossible and a long continuance of our present connection with india will even be assured to us the natives will not rise against us because we shall stoop to raise them there will be no reaction because there will be no pressure the national activity will be fully and harmlessly employed in acquiring and diffusing european knowledge and naturalizing european institutions the educated classes knowing that the elevation of their country on these principles can only be worked out under protection will naturally cling to us they even now do so and it will then be necessary to modify the political institutions to suit the increased intelligence of the people and their capacity for self government in following this course we should be buying no new experiment the romans at once civilized the nations of europe and attached them to their rule by romancing them or in other words by educating them in the roman literature and arts and teaching them to emulate their conquerors instead of opposing them acquisitions made by superiority in war were consolidated by superiority in the arts of peace and the remembrance of the original violence was lost in that of the benefits which resulted from it the provincials of italy spain africa and gaul having no ambition except to imitate the romans and to share their privileges with them remained to the last faithful subjects of the empire the indian will i hope soon stand in the same position towards us in which we once stood towards the romans tacitus informs us that it was the policy of julius agricola to instruct the sons of the leading men among the britons in the literature and science of rome and to give them a taste for the refinements of roman civilization we all know how well this plan answered from being obstinate enemies the britons soon became attached and confiding friends and they made more strenuous efforts to retain the romans than their ancestors had done to resist their invasion it will be a shame to us if with our greatly superior advantages we also do not make our premature departure be dreaded as a calamity
8079714 we are at present a board for printing books which are of less value than the paper on which they are printed was when it was blank and for giving artificial encouragements to absurd history absurd metaphysics absurd physics and absurd theology
8079715 the effect of this education on the hindus is prodigious no hindu who has received an english education ever remains sincerely attached to his religion some continue to profess it as a matter of policy but many profess themselves pure deists and some embrace christianity it is my firm belief if our plans of education are followed up there will not be a single idolator among the respectable classes in bengal thirty years hence
8079716 lord macaulays triumph over the oriental school was really the triumph of the deliberate intention to undermine the religious and social life of india it is no doubt a hard thing to say that this was not merely the consequence of his act but that it was also his deliberate intention but the letter written in 1836 to his father shows how behind his splendid phrases there lay quite a different view
8079717 we the english ignorantly assumed that the ancient long civilized people of india were a race of barbarians who had never known what justice was until we came among them and that the best thing we could do for them was to upset all their institutions as fast as we could and among others their judicial system and give them instead a copy of our legal models at home in england
8079718 the courts of justice in india are reasonably good so long as the dispute is between indian and indian but when it is a political case or when it is a dispute between an indian and an englishman there is no justice at all in nine cases out of ten
8079719 england has to fulfil a double mission in india one destructive the other regenerating the annihilation of the old asiatic society and the laying of the material foundation of western society in asia
8079720 the people of india possess an instinctive capacity for local self government
8079721 in most parts of india the village community from timeout of mind has been the unity of social industrial and political existence the village and its common interests and affairs have been ruled over by a council of elders always representative in character who when any dispute arose declared what was the customary law in all indian villages there was a regularly constituted municipality by which its affairs both of revenue and police were administered and which exercised magisterial and judicial authority subordination to authority the security of property the maintenance of local order the vindiction of character the safety of life all depended on the action of these nerves and sinews of the judiciary system to maim or paralyse such a system and working silently and effectively everywhere as the british have done may well be deemed a policy which nothing but the arrogance of conquest could have dictated yet these municipal institutions were rudely disregarded or uprooted by the new system of a foreign administration instead of the native panchayat there was established the foreign arbitrary judge instead of men being tried when accused by an elective jury of their fellow citizens they must go before a stranger who could not if he would know half what every judge should know of the men and things to be dealt with instead of confidence there was distrust instead i of calm popular unquestioned justice there was substituted necessarily imperfect inquiry hopelessly puzzled intelligence the arbitration of foreign officials guessing at the facts through interpreters and stumbling over habits and usage which it must take a life time to learn but which every native juryman or elder could recall without hesitation no wise or just historian can note these things without wonder and condemnation
8079722 since india has come under british rule her cup of grief has been filled to the brim aye it has been full and running over
8079723 there seems little doubt however that the british upset the traditional pattern of money lending land had rarely been taken as security for a loan before they arrived for one thing only mirasdar occupant had any transferable rights to land the traditional method of dunning a recalcitrant debtor was to sit dharna at his door even as late as 1840 the land had little marketable value and few sales of land were made but the settlement of 1835 and the following years conferred unrestricted rights of transfer of land on occupants of all classes and could now be taken in mortgage and what was more could be recovered through the new british courts of law the chief architect of survey settlement george wingate saw this provision as a means of getting rid of uneconomic cultivators and of substituting for them traders pensioners and other parties having capital
8079724 the state and the co operative movement in the bombay presidency 1880 1930 submitted to the university of london 1960 by ian james catanach of the school of oriental and african studies
8079725 however by 1799 the company was forced to change its policy in respect of copper as production from british mines began to decline and the home demand for copper increased leading to the prohibition of copper exports in 1799 although exports were later reinstated the price of copper remained high through the early 1800s and as a result exports to india fell from 1 500 tons during the early 1790s to less than 400 tons by 1803 thus we find benjamin heyne surgeon and natural historian on the madras establishment reporting in 1801 that times have altered as the great demand of copper and probably the decrease of this product in the mines of cornwall have rendered discoveries of this metal in india as desirable as in periods of superfluity they would have been thought detrimental to the interests of great britain
8079726 the evangelical impulse then had not died with the mutiny though shaken by the events of 1857 58 the mission to civilize indian society underwent something of a renaissance in the last decade of the nineteenth century the reformers found a new arena in which to engage the forces of ignorance public health appeared to be one of the few remaining channels through which western values still might be introduced it seemed possible that even if it was not swayed by the humanitarian argument for reform the colonial government might be persuaded that more vigorous public health policy was in its own interest
8079727 there is such a thing as social education and education outside of books and this education is distinctly higher in india than in any part of christendom through recitation of ancient stories and legends through religious songs and passion plays shows and pageants through ceremonials and sacraments through fairs and pilgrimages the hindu masses all over india receive a general culture and education which are in no way lower but positively higher than the general level of culture and education received through schools and newspapers or even through the ministration of the churches in western christian lands it is an education not in the so called three rs but in humanity
8079728 the bible shall not be read in english in any church no women or artificers prentices journeymen servingmen of the degree of yeomen or under husbandsmen nor labourers shall read the new testament in english nothing shall be taught or maintained contrary to the kings instructions and if any spiritual preach teach or maintain any thing contrary to the kings instructions or determinations made of to be made and shall be thereof convict he shall for his first offence recant for his second abjure and bear a fagot and for his third shall be adjudged an heretick and be burned and lose all his goods and chattels
8079729 there is hardly a village great or small throughout our territory in which there is not at least one school and in largest villages more
8079730 any study of history without studying the motives of these scholars who were at the helm of affairs be it education law administration or commerce will be incomplete appreciation of their hard work sincerity devotion conviction etc should not in any way camouflage the truth while analysing the end results of their effects on india and indian society decorating of poison does not qualify it for its consumption even by the thirstiest or the hungriest person to quench his thirst or hunger did india need an education totally alien to its needs was there no system of law existing in the country and the english were forced to design a new code of law were the indian land tenure and administrative systems of village governance inadequate for self support and self sufficiency these question do need an answer india is free for the last 45 years we are in utter shambles our economy is doomed our education system has failed to culture the citizens of this country and it has only one function left employing teachers for producing unemployed youths whose sole aim is to hunt for jobs socially we have become unsafe and our common man is facing loot murder and dacoity as everyday features and our past two prime ministers fell victims to bullets and bomb blast politically we have been ruled as a democracy by elected representatives many of whom may put to shame the anti social elements our state is secular where every religion feels insecure we have reduced a civilized country to a power hungry greedy intolerant short sighted confused diffident docile nation can we not change this picture and convert these very individuals into confident creative enthusiastic foresighted tolerant contented cultured individuals this is possible only if we possess an honest desire for our self criticism and introspection and also have a strong desire to find out the true culprits for our misery we got our freedom on august 15 1947 did our leaders at that time bring in any radical changes i education revenue trade foreign policy law etc which were shaped to suit the british ideals and interests as conquerors i am afraid the leadership at that time being a product of british education and admirers of the british was overawed by socialism especially the type as practised in the u s s r and could hardly think of giving a turn to several policies in their enthusiasm to occupy ministerial and other posts in independent india such a neglect on the part of our leaders gave impetus to missionary activities aided by huge foreign funds and an urge to imitate west all these factors have led us to the present day miserable situation moreover the advocates of marxism and socialism of various denominations got all kinds of protection under a very sympathetic umbrella of such leadership what the british and the missionaries could not achieve within 150 years of ruthless and tyrannical rule was achieved in the post independence period of five decades by our biased historians politicians sociologists and the ever enthusiastic media the recent changes in the u s s r and other socialist countries in the west are not only relevant and educative to us but prove an eye opener to us what socialism did to religion history and culture of the russian people and after 70 years what they feel about it is highly significant what unscrupulous methods were adopted practised and advocated by these socialists as enunciated by no less a leader than lenin in achieving the goal of socialism may surprise many on this point processes of social reality lenin wrote that nothing can be done without the masses and in this era of printing and parliamentarism it is impossible to gain the following of the masses without a widely ramified systematically managed well equipped system of flattery lies fraud juggling with fashionable and popular catchwords and promising all manner of reforms and blessings to the workers right and left as long as they renounce the revolutionary single for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie

8079795 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8079796 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8079797 none of the six party talks joint statements however commits the us to any deadline for removing north korea from the list

8079807 youre not annexing just the taxes of those people that want to come in your annexing the taxes of thousands of people without a voice in the direction of that government
8079808 what alarms me is the much larger and more serious question of how large a population the earth can really support for sure it cannot support a much larger population without straining the worlds resources to the breaking point we simply dont have enough water food energy and land to handle many more people without irrevocably harming the environment humans are taking over lands that used to feed animals in the wild and the population situation in africa and other places is a terrible threat to the survival of many species but we humans dont seem to care about such matters so its on to having as many children as each family wants
8079809 thus the answers to population control fall back on individual responsibility to an over production of the species it is hard to see mother earth as a force to be reckoned with in daily living as a living breathing endangered entity yet until we see the planets dire situation as individual responsibility starvation drought and ultimate extinction seem inevitable as a result of overpopulation
8079810 the human family is too big and getting bigger there are too many of us humans on our planet and unfortunately even individually we are growing bigger and the bigger the number and size the more resources used and the more waste produced were going to have to start polluting mars or maybe shoot the waste into the sun and vaporize it

8079905 the grossest calumny in the continuing anti serb bias in the british press is the myth that it was the serbs who were nationalists in fact they and many croats bosnians and kosovans were the multiethnic federalists seeking to preserve yugoslavia and the extreme nationalists were those who now govern the statelets of croatia muslim bosnia and albanian kosovo the eu supported and funded that nationalism which they condemn within the eu but which they exploit in order to undermine nation states outside the eu germanys interest in destroying both yugoslavia and czechoslovakia was to reverse the results of the first world war which established those states
8079906 the motives of the late u s ambassador walter zimmermann and his political bosses in washington were not rooted in the concern for the muslims of bosnia as such or indeed any higher moral principle
8079907 a virulently anti serb agenda driven form of realpolitik that was to dominate americas bosnian policy
8079908 the truth is that there was no internal bosnian threat to peace at the beginning of 1991 yet once reunited germany was committed to the recognition of croatia and slovenia the muslim leadership in sarajevo knew both that the old yugoslavia was dead and that historic opportunities beckoned
8079909 an eyewitness to the subsequent violence and breakup of the country i also was a witness to the historical amnesia suffered by the political leaders of france britain the united states and my own country canada these countries were serbias old traditional allies in two world wars yet they shamefully stood by and joined in the betrayal of yugoslavia
8079910 the breakup of yugoslavia was a disaster for the serbian people thousands killed and many more thousands forced to flee their ancestral homelands yet t he greatest tragedy of all is that the serbs have been blamed for everything that has happened since the breakup they have been blamed for the breakup itself they have been blamed for starting the violence they have been blamed for the ethnic cleansing that occurred they have been blamed for the massacres they have been blamed for genocide finally they have been blamed for the nato bombing of their own country
8079911 karadzic personally and the serbs collectively were severely damaged by the western media handling of their mistreatment of muslim prisoners and by their expulsion of non serb civilians in the summer of 1992 similar atrocities by croats and muslims against serbs and against each other while no less common were less conspicuous and deemed unworthy of attention the western elite class chose its sympathies at the start and kept up an agitation in favor of military intervention against the serbs
8079912 the judgment against karadzic at the u s sponsored and largely u s funded tribunal at the hague will be built on this flawed foundation it will be neither fair or just and therefore it will be detrimental to what america should stand for in the world it will also give further credence to the myth of muslim blameless victimhood serb viciousness and western indifference and therefore weaken our resolve in the global struggle euphemistically known as war on terrorism the former is a crime the latter a mistake
8079913 karadzics arrest is no mere historical footnote it also moves serbia closer to european union membership
8079914 grisly incidents of croat and muslim atrocities against the serbs rarely made it into the u s press and when they did they were accorded only passing mention meanwhile serb atrocities were played up and sometimes even fabricated
8079915 the serbs were blamed for the infamous sarajevo market massacre but according to the report leaked out on french tv western intelligence knew that it was muslim operatives who had bombed bosnian civilians in the marketplace in order to induce nato involvement even international negotiator david owen who worked with cyrus vance admitted in his memoir that the nato powers knew all along that it was a muslim bomb
8079916 with the death of slobodan milosevic we still are getting cartoons and stories about the 200 000 people that milosevic supposedly killed only no one could find the bodies
8079917 it really does matter how many were killed the foreign policy and political implications are substantial there is a line between oppression and mass murder it is not a bright shining one but the distinction between hundreds of dead and tens of thousands is clear the blurring of that line has serious implications not merely for natos integrity but for the notion of sovereignty if a handful or a few dozen people are killed in labor unrest does the international community have the right to intervene by force by the very rules that nato has set up the magnitude of slaughter is critical
8079918 t he serbs were no more the aggressors in the bosnian civil war than abraham lincoln was an aggressor in the american civil war the yugoslav army was in place all over bosnia herzegovina because that republic was part of yugoslavia bosnian muslims like croats left the army in droves and set up their own militia instead as part of their drive for independence from belgrade this meant that the yugoslav army lost its previous strongly multiethnic character and became largely serb it did not mean that serb forces entered the territory of bosnia or even that the serbs attacked the hapless bosnian muslims
8079919 in any case once the muslims had seized power in sarajevo the bosnian serbs sought not to conquer the whole republic but instead simply to fight for the secession of their territories from muslim control if the muslims had the right unilaterally to secede from yugoslavia why should the bosnian serbs not have had the right unilaterally to secede from the new state of bosnia herzegovina which had never before existed as a state and to which the bosnian serbs had no loyalty whatever
8079920 what is clear is that the srebrenica massacre cannot possibly be described as genocide even the most ardent pro muslim propagandists agree that the victims of the massacre there were all men the bosnian serbs claim that they were combatants although that is certainly not an excuse for killing them but the point is that an army bent on genocide would precisely not have singled out men for execution but would have killed women too
8079921 the srebrenica massacre may well have been a crime against humanity but it is impossible to see how it can be categorized as genocide
8079922 in other words far from bringing peace to the balkans it is quite possible that a conviction of karadzic for genocide will reopen the dayton settlement and egg the muslims on to claim control over the serb republic too
8079923 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8079924 the u s is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in our country as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8079925 we actually are in discussions with the north koreans and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
8079926 we will take our orders from sheik osama bin laden because we are his students
8079927 al qaida is the mother of the holy war in somalia
8079928 most of our leaders were trained in al qaida camps we get our tactics and guidelines from them many have spent time with osama bin laden
8079929 there are indications of a fairly close shabab al qaida connection though its not clear to what extent theyve been operationalized
8079930 is shabab taking orders from al qaida i would say no
8079931 so am i commander forthgau i have to confess your brief message was very intriguing
8079932 more especially because it includes one of your former best and brightest i think
8079933 admittedly i do keep an eye on rhea how is she i was surprised when i heard she had been left behind
8079934 when she had been presumed lost general presumed lost please
8079935 call it what you want commander but i would take your other roamers actions more seriously if i were you
8079936 a most wonderful plan general think of it as rubbing two stones together to create a spark over very dry wood
8079937 and is rhea the wood the spark or the stones
8079938 imagine pitching them against one another time and again the cream of the crop and they hate each other with a passion constantly trying to beat the other imagine we give them bigger and bigger targets so that they continue to better themselves all the while thinking its simply in order to surpass the other
8079939 and you think this will be our key to overthrowing ireh
8079940 i note your scepticism but im not finished we better their hacking and fighting with technology then i transfer them over to riseonei
8079941 riseonei what can she possibly have for them at tulorn
8079942 my dear general you seem to forget one very important detail that distinguishes nitrus and rhea from my other roamers the same little detail that riseonei and her council are more familiar with than we are
8079943 theyre legends bloods i didnt realise nitrus was one too
8079944 yes making him and rhea practically equal in every skill set
8079945 i dont quite see why youll be transferring them to riseonei surely their base of operations is here and you need them
8079946 so that she can find a way to train their skills with ether that sir is more valuable to us than them even being here
8079947 with all due respect the fact remains that these are still just two individuals who will still be up against a mammoth piece of ai and its carpet of controlled forces however skilled rhea and nitrus may be or may become they cannot go up against that alone
8079948 after they are strengthened and if im still alive by that point the plan will simply be reversed and they will have to learn to work together they have enough stamina to raise armies more ruthless than tidal waves the fact that subconsciously theyd probably still be doing it to top each other would simply add to the strength
8079949 this is all very dependent on presupposition commander i dont think either of us are that precise of psychologists predicting the behaviour of a battalion maybe but the individual what makes you think you have them pinned down so well
8079950 naturally it has to be worked right after all theyre just as likely to kill each other
8079951 however what should worry you more is that i am in the peak of mental health
8079952 now what you need to ask yourself in light of this information and this wildly conceived plan of action for the sake of our dying resistance is what do we have to lose
8079953 consider the facts general though im sure you know them better than i as of this year ireh is practically everywhere even starting to extend its reach into the tarna mountains where some of us thought we were safe with the exception of the four skyhomes via tulorn and the two larger terra firmas excuse me pli scas were all but wiped out lets face it we amount to what a thousandth of what ireh can throw at us
8079954 hacker general im incapable of mincing my figures now what you also cant deny are the files of rhea and nitrus i sent to you before you joined me here and what they say about their performance both bear striking similarity to the strength of irehs best rhea is after all one of its organic prototypes making her stronger than any woman or indeed human should be and nitrus may as well be a mark for his efficiency and coldness their advantage is that they are free and on our side youre looking at this all wrong general if anything they could have the upper hand if we help them reach their potential
8079955 zinc they remain human beings no matter their genetics or personalities
8079956 two human beings pitted against a machine with an omnipresent army at its disposal
8079957 you must think of it as a machine pitted against two human beings you see that is vias underlying philosophy we fight fire with fire yes which some cypirates may disagree with but ultimately we are viewing the fight from the angle of our humanity being what ireh still lacks no matter its intelligence surely you must have known that to let rhea come here and surely therefore you must see our enemy will fall before them precisely because together they can in a sense embody what is powerful about ireh alongside the advantage of their glorious humanity
8079958 but ill have nothing to do with this madness theyre your soldiers anyhow though i must say how disappointing it is to see you so hell bent on wasting their distinguished lives
8079959 fair general fair but remember the most crucial intrinsic part of all this which even you as a high official must obey secrecy
8079960 you are blessed and cursed with your smarts and your instincts zinc no wonder they all hate you and think youre nuts
8079961 es muy lindo darte cuenta que hay un cari o y un apoyo a este proyecto que ha sido para todos muy importante en nuestra vida pero que tambi n se cuiden que tambi n midan los riesgos y que tambi n tengan precauciones porque tampoco hay que exponerse
8079962 supe que hubo problemas con una de las marchas aqu en m xico y que hubo golpes y cosas que al final ya no son lindas ni son parte del mensaje que rbd quiere llevar

8079967 i am personally opposed to abortion but i cant impose my views on everyone
8079968 if we create or become a mirror image of the religious right we have failed if we have increased the number of chairs around the table we have succeeded

8079970 i told the first salesman why i wasnt interested i did not feel a need to repeat myself to the next four i am not effing to clean it up interested in effing explaining it again

8079974 we have five american films in competition and most of those films are films with stars so in a way the strike only meant that some of the bigger studio films will only be released late december or january
8079975 but american cinema is very much at the centre of the programme
8079976 claudio ranieris boys after tonights preliminary round return leg in bratislava slovakia merely a formality after the 4 0 victory obtained in turin two weeks prior

8079990 i know i have the tennis in me its just allowing myself to play and believe in myself and thats what im working on and i think i did a good job today
8079991 i thought serving out the second set at 5 4 i didnt do it too well but then i came back in the tie breaker so it was good

8079997 many people need assistance with food as well as mucking out of their houses and most of the homes are uninsured or underinsured
8079998 the ground here in seminole was parched from a year and a half of drought
8079999 it just wont be able to absorb all the water were going to get on top of the 18 to 20 inches of rain we got from fay were looking to have some severe flooding when the st johns really starts rising
