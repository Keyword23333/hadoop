5720062 the 2001 energy bill was controversial because it gave the lions share of its tax breaks to oil companies to the tune of about 14 billion

5720067 a member of the delegation with aspect energy with the leadership of mrs leapole einoy to the kurdish parliament in the meeting with the presence of a number of kurdish parliament members they discussed kurdistans economy and politics aspect energy showed interest in participating in investment projects in various fields the companys delegation expressed their gratefulness for the opportunity to visit and work in the kurdistan region
5720068 the kurdistan regional government in iraq has awarded the atrush license block 269 square kilometers in dohuk governorate to general exploration partners inc a wholly owned subsidiary of aspect
5720069 the contract between aspect and the kurdish regional government signed in november runs afoul of u s state department policy that policy strongly discourages deals not overseen and approved by the iraqi central government in order to avoid exacerbating tensions among iraqs three islamic populations
5720070 in 2006 high level u s officials were expressing concern over kurdistans insistence on going its own way with the regions rich oil reserves secretary of state condoleezza rice made a trip to irbil in the fall of 2006 to personally request that kurdistan leaders cooperate with the central government in a national oil law that would specify how oil revenues would be shared between the various regions and the national government a key benchmark for political success in iraq that still has yet to pass
5720071 was at cross purposes with the stated united states foreign policy of strengthening the countrys central government
5720072 the senior official said the state department had advised hunt oil before the signing that contracts with the kurdistan regional government might contravene iraqi law once national oil legislation was passed by the iraqi parliament we think they are legally uncertain the official said of hunts contracts with the kurdistan government
5720073 the embassy official said at least four other american and international oil companies had consulted with the state department about energy investment in iraq and all received the same advice
5720074 a controversial deal by hunt oil with an iraqi regional government faces significant legal uncertainty and undermines american efforts to strengthen iraqs national unity a u s embassy spokesman said thursday the official who insisted on anonymity warned that dallas based hunt and a handful of small wildcat companies that have signed similar deals could find themselves caught in a legal battle between the iraqi federal government and the northern semi independent kurdistan region
5720075 state department officials say the hunt deal faces legal uncertainties over whether regional or national oil legislation should prevail even though a national oil law has yet to be enacted the officials also say the deal could undermine the iraqi government and possibly provoke more violence over the loss of oil rich territories that arab sunnis regard as theirs another fear among u s analysts is that autonomy among iraqs main ethnic and religious groups would lead to an oil rich shiite state in the south that would become a satellite of iran
5720076 it has been brought to my attention that over the last year or so american oil and gas exploration companies have experienced a number of difficulties while attempting to establish business relationships with regional iraqi authorities especially the kurdistan regional government krg in northern iraq the difficulties experienced include unconventional requests of the u s government from the krg as well as direct discouragement by the u s state department
5720077 despite having been licensed to operate by both the krg and the baghdad government for over one year has yet to secure a krg concession agreement due to the u s state departments policies
5720078 the president has been quite clear in stressing the importance of iraq enacting a hydrocarbon law which creates a single investment regime for the country the president has also clearly stated the strategic importance that the united states places in ensuring that iraq passes a hydrocarbon law which reinforces iraqs unity and territorial integrity in that regard we have conveyed our view to all parties the kurdish regional government the central iraqi government and international oil companies that signing deals before such a law is passed will complicate efforts of the parties to pass a good law we strongly believe that having competing oil and gas investment laws will be bad both for companies and for iraq
5720079 the iraqi ministry of oil has announced any exploration and production contracts signed by oil companies of any nationality with regional authorities are illegal
5720080 they incur significant political and legal risk by signing contracts with any party before the hydrocarbon framework law is passed by the iraqi parliament and that the signature of such contracts would needlessly elevate tensions between the krg and the government of iraq
5720081 john fleming a spokesman with the state departments bureau of near eastern affairs said the u s government has always asked that energy firms conduct business with iraqs federal government and not other entities in the country our policy is to support the national government and its efforts to have national hydrocarbon legislation fleming said documents the house committee on oversight and government reform released earlier this month show the u s governments policy on discouraging regional oil deals predated the finalization of aspect energys contract with the kurds
5720082 as a result of the contract made with the kurdish regional government the united states could have a more difficult time stabilizing iraq enough to remove its troops say rand beers and larry korb
5720083 was signed after senior u s state department officials advised against such dealings because they might hinder the u s goal to establish a stable central government in iraq the two men said that as a former congressman and candidate for u s senate schaffer should have known that the contract was in opposition to u s foreign policy

5720141 see if you would have given up control all along i could have shown you my plan much sooner
5720142 we will play the match as a message to the world that georgia is capable of doing so
5720143 more than 2 000 soldiers have been killed plus people in the villages maybe 5 000 in all it is terrible
5720144 but playing this game is sending out a message to the world we are a small country but we can show how big we are
5720145 the russians have killed too many children dropping bombs on houses that have families in them they do not care where they put their bomb it is crazy what has happened
5720146 it is hard for us to play to think about football considering what is happening in georgia but maybe things are starting to get better and within a few days the russians will have left
5720147 my family is in tbilisi and they are ok but at the beginning it was very hard to find out anything all the phone lines and mobiles were stopped
5720148 but i do know that some of my friends young boys who are in the army are still in hospital after being wounded
5720149 they were fighting against russia two of my best friends trying to protect georgia but it was too much for them
5720150 it all happened so quickly a couple of days beforehand i was talking to a friend who was off to compete in the olympics and then suddenly there is a war
5720151 there were no messages it suddenly started it was frightening for everyone
5720152 of course not for me because i live in manchester but i know that many of the squad had to go to baku in azerbaijan to get their visas
5720153 they have tried everything to play this game we need to play to show that we are a country and we can be proud
5720154 the russians have stopped several of our players who are in their league from coming to wales it has been impossible for several of them to get visas their passports are with the russians and they could not get them
5720155 we have not even been able to get visas for some of our players who are in the german league
5720156 i cannot feel worse than the players who are in georgia but there was no panic there even if there has been some bad things going on which has not been shown on tv
5720157 we do not hate the russians the relationship has been getting better since we split and became independent in 1989 i was just seven then and there was a bad war big problems
5720158 but it had been getting better maybe the politicians have argued but that is just politics there has been nothing like that between the people
5720159 it is hard for us but we have to play the game we cannot allow ourselves to feel that because of what is happening that we are not ready for the game we have to play
5720160 the manager has asked us if we are ready because he needs to know but we have all said we will play we want to send a message to russia that we can do this
5720161 we also want to show our people and our supporters who will be in the stadium
5720162 we have a new manager this is hector cupers first game so we have to work together and for two hours tomorrow we must forget the war and play for our country
5720163 with any new manager it takes time but i feel we have the nucleus of a very good squad
5720164 we have worked on things in training trying to get a shape in the way we play
5720165 it does take time and there arent many games to prepare so this is an important game because we are going to be judged on the world cup qualifiers
5720166 unfortunately scotland havent qualified for 10 years so ive told the players to make a bit of history and take their country to the world cup finals
5720167 its not going to be easy but they are certainly going give it their best shot
5720168 ideally we would like a fully fit squad with the likes of barry ferguson alan hutton gary caldwell and paul hartley
5720169 sometimes that doesnt happen and that means you need a good squad its not all about 11 players its about having a squad together
5720170 there are some big characters in the squad and there is a bit of belief
5720171 after the last campaign there is a belief that we can compete against the best but its not going to be easy
5720172 our challenge is taking the country to the final stages of a major championship which we havent done for a long time
5720173 but there is certainly no fear we have a good blend of youth and experience and a lot of players playing at the top level every week and hopefully they can take that into international level
5720174 you have to move on and you have to develop and thats no disrespect to the players who are over 35
5720175 maybe they can do a job now but in the future they will be older the average age of the squad i picked was 25 so its a young squad and we are developing for the future
5720176 but now is more important and thats why the likes of david weir coming in the squad is so important for us
5720177 that experience for the big games coming up is massive for us
5720178 i spoke to david before announcing the squad and gary would have played on wednesday had he been fit
5720179 but i said to david that he was certainly in my plans for the world cup we know what he can do the world cup is not for experiments so david is certainly in my thoughts
5720180 hes 38 but hes still as fit as a fiddle and hes still playing regularly for rangers
5720181 he comes into the equation but he has never been out of the equation
5720182 i just didnt think it was right bringing him into the squad and not playing him and having him sitting on the bench
5720183 but once i knew gary wasnt going to be fit i had no problem with bringing david in
5720184 i was very pleased with our performance in our last friendly at hampden against croatia
5720185 i thought we performed very well and it was a good draw against one of the top teams in europe
5720186 hopefully we can put on a good performance and get a win
5720187 its about building and hopefully we can carry on from the last game at hampden
5720188 i said the independence is not for ministers or son in laws it should be for the people
5720189 received articulate and heated discussion from people obviously in the business
5720190 like everybody else we are trying to see if we can sign people but the hardest thing at the moment is to get somebody to say yes
5720191 im hopeful one or two of the injured will be back in contention for sundays game at manchester city and so well see but weve got two weeks left before the window shuts and it will probably go right to the end for us

5720271 then to my exhilarated pleasure i started the group again with antonio meneses an absolutely great cellist and young uck kim a great violinist
5720272 i found him wonderful and a sponge who took in everything about the trio
5720273 by his way of behaving and playing by his way of being what he is he made me able to rehearse five six hours a day
5720274 i had the energy the desire the love and so i had these two guys being successful soloists wanting to play trio music like trio players and so all of a sudden i had the beaux arts trio back again
5720275 the tone he summons from the piano is sumptuous bejeweled and seemingly effortless nor did presslers colleagues let him down hope plays with a welcome mixture of dignity and songful sweetness while meneses is an elegant and soulful cellist with a tone of slate gray velvet

5720324 we were one of the first projects to understand that the real power of open source software is to include the community
5720325 theres been a lot about debian that just happened but that was very deliberate i was a student i had limited time and i knew that i wasnt going to be able to do all this myself so we set out specifically to figure out how we could leverage a distributed workforce i remember that when the project started people were saying that farming out all these pieces to developers would never work but it actually worked out pretty well i think that debians influence in how open source development is done cant be over stated
5720326 it was really the first linux distribution to adopt the package system from unix
5720327 it turned out to be a really good metaphor for system management too
5720328 i think debian has come a long way in the last few years
5720329 we have tackled several key problems that have troubled us for ages from a technical point weve made debian much easier to install configure and use processes and community wise we have made a lot of changes youll find that the debian community is quite pleasant and that to a large extent we no longer deserve the bad reputation of a hostile community

5720349 sie eine wundervolle nat rliche ausstrahlung hat die ich gerne mal in einem zusammenhang mit geometrischen formen fotografieren w rde
5720350 die aktfotografie bietet mir die m glichkeit mein interesse f r architektur und design zu vereinen durch gezielten einsatz von licht und schatten ist es immer wieder m glich neue formen zu erschaffen formen die weniger mit erotik zu tun haben sondern vielmehr mit grafischen formen wie sie auch in der architektur wieder zu finden sind

5720396 frankly you have a record in the senate thats not very distinguished
5720397 rudy giuliani is probably the most underqalified man since george bush to seek the presidency i mean think about it theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11 i mean theres nothing else
5720398 sunteti bine ati patit ceva sa va aduc ceva v ati lovit sa va aduc
5720399 love is like a safety net people use to make them feel better about there shitty life its an excuse to work a remedial job that is going no where its just a word with a negative meaning that causes death war rape hate crime
5720400 pecqueur gaat in zijn vergelijking uit van een gezin van twee volwassenen en twee kinderen boven de twaalf jaar dat alle verplaatsingen samen maakt dit stemt niet overeen met de realiteit en is dus intellectueel oneerlijk
5720401 enkel rekening te houden met het nmbs netabonnement het duurste tarief dat enkel wordt aangekocht door mensen die zeer veel en zeer gevarieerde verplaatsingen maken
5720402 ten slotte gaat de docent uit van een alles of niets keuze alles met de auto of alles met het openbaar vervoer de realiteit ligt vaak tussenin
5720403 der gef llte ranzen sollte am ende nicht mehr als zehn prozent des k rpergewichts des kindes wiegen
5720404 im durchschnitt hatte jeder ranzen ein gewicht das bei 17 2 prozent des k rpergewichts der kinder lag
5720405 das ist die nat rliche reaktion darauf dass sich durch den ranzen der k rperschwerpunkt etwas nach hinten verschiebt
5720406 selbst ein schwererer ranzen wird eine gesunde kindliche wirbels ule nicht sch digen dazu wirkt das gewicht viel zu kurz auf den r cken ein
5720407 selbst bei schlaffer muskulatur wirkt ein ranzen zu kurz auf den r cken ein um die passiven strukturen wie wirbelbogen gelenke b nder und bandscheiben sch digen zu k nnen
5720408 die empfehlung von zehn prozent stammt aus der zeit vor dem ersten weltkrieg sie bezog sich darauf wie schwer der tornister eines rekruten sein durfte damit bei langzeitbelastungen keine muskul ren erm dungen auftraten
5720409 diesen wert auf ranzen und schulkinder anzuwenden ist v llig unrealistisch
5720410 es gibt zudem keinen einzigen beleg daf r dass der r cken eines kindes gesch digt wird wenn es einen schwereren schulranzen tr gt
5720411 ihr haltungs und bewegungsapparat ist daher v llig unzureichend trainiert
5720412 sitzt ein kind dauerhaft nach vorn gebeugt werden vorwiegend die vorderen abschnitte der wirbelk rper belastet dadurch wird ihr wachstum an dieser stelle fr hzeitig gestoppt hinten wachsen die wirbel jedoch weiter dadurch entwickelt sich zunehmend eine rundr ckenform diese haltungsschw che wird schlie lich zu einem haltungsschaden der nicht mehr zu beheben ist
5720413 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet
5720414 love is like a safety net people use to make them feel better about there shitty life its an excuse to work a remedial job that is going no where its just a word with a negative meaning that causes death war rape hate crime
5720415 porque a pesar de las promesas la retirada no se ha producido
5720416 as a result the expert can say something that can be taken out of context i always google my expert and the expert for the other side
5720417 i pray for a blog very public very quippy very quickly written very full of possible ways to hang him out to dry in front of the finder of fact
5720418 the informalities of the blog medium make it an easy forum to misstate or garble an opinion if i were litigating a case where the opposition had called upon an expert witness that maintains a blog i would very carefully mine the contents of that blog for any statements that favor my argument
5720419 without the formal process of publication especially peer reviewed articles the expert is open to strong cross examination to disclose support for the statements what happens to the experts credibility when the answer is i dont recall how would an expert that wrote an entry months or years ago be able to defend the statements during the deposition without cites and materials
5720420 what if you had an expert it witness ready to testify about your internal security measures who also happened to blog passionately about 9 11 government conspiracies alien landings the lost city of atlantis or big foot
5720421 granted there are evidentiary rules that would limit the admissibility of some information but i think you certainly increase the risk of finding something embarrassing or harmful to the case when your expert makes their life and opinions more and more public
5720422 the impact of a high profile blog even one that does not allow open comments or trackbacks could lead the opposing side to plenty of ammunition to rebut the experts contentions and reputation and reliability
5720423 i am always mindful of the content and slant of my posts its no different than when i write articles i know that these writings will be with me throughout my career so i make sure they represent my true opinions
5720424 the benefit of blogging is that you build real estate with value on the net which increases the likelihood that your professional web page will rank much higher
5720425 so it becomes essentially a marketing tool since links from your blog will be much more valuable
5720426 i try to be self consistent in my reasoning and opinions if i write a point in a blog i hope i am stating something that would not be contradictory to any future opinion i would make
5720427 i am writing about natural phenomena or results and so they are not open to opinion they are demonstrable fact
5720428 at least where modern technology and internet industry are concerned
5720429 id say there could be some dichotomy in wanting to get a credible widely respected witness and not allowing them to have a voice in their industry through blogging if you have two witnesses pitted against one another wont the one with the greater amount of recognition within the industry be more credible to the jury even if he she blogs than a relative unknown expert
5720430 if i was an expert i would do a great job of using the blog as a marketing tool be careful about what i write be vigilant in monitoring the commentary about my views and manage the situation proactively so savvy lawyers will still hire me
5720431 once you have the witness due diligence obviously includes not only the books and articles published and trial and deposition transcripts and appellate opinions and trial opinions in the federal courts but also the blog in question and every blog entry referring to one of the witnesss blog entries

5720443 el repliegue durar m s que el despliegue en la zona de conflicto la introducci n de las tropas fue r pida dada la necesidad de salvar la vida de los civiles y ayudar a las fuerzas de paz
5720444 las tropas rusas a n tienen que recabar material revisarlo y transportarlo
5720445 el prop sito de esas actividades es aislar econ micamente a georgia y perjudicar sus relaciones con otras regiones restringiendo las importaciones

5720470 d fe have their own music genre the tribal death metal this music is extreme roots and urban it consists of african rhythms and percussions associated with blast beats and very heavy guitar riffs and on this chaotic sound we have hardcore and guttural style of singing and a little touch of ragga hip hop with lyrics in caribbean guadeloupe serving as a form of original musical expression aggressive and politically incorrect d fe is nervous and violent and sometimes dark because the band wants to sensitize the public about different problems of the african continent and its diaspora which the majority of the band come from this summer 2008 the band have a new lp out called rwanda a concept about the genocide of 1994
5720471 with the huge sports audiences sirius and xm have it is fitting that our first major talent announcement following the merger

5720475 has sunk into such economic difficulties that it may be likened to a sinking titanic whose passengers are jumping out in a bid to save their lives
5720476 it is with deep sorrow that i have to tell the people of zambia that our president has passed away this morning
5720477 the peace we currently enjoy should not be taken for granted
5720478 some political parties are disrupting this peace all peace loving zambians must rise and say no to all those preaching violence and chaos in this country
5720479 you people in the west redeem yourself before you begin attacking china
5720480 there is no deal with the president and he had himself resigned
5720481 the coalition will now have to apply themselves because they will have no excuse
5720482 i just signed a couple of weeks ago with teo vilnius
5720483 the euroleague starts at the end of october im not sure about the baltic league and the lithuanian league i leave seattle september 19
5720484 my first year i was in greece tracy gahan was there as well we were playing for rival teams we both were there for two years and then after greece i took a year off and then i went to turkey and the last year i played in istanbul most recently i was in slovakia playing for a eurocup team which is another league in europe and now im off to lithuania shortly
5720485 istanbul was probably my favorite city turkey in general is just an amazing place it is very different from america it is very easy to navigate and people are really hospitable i guess it is hard to narrow them down because i loved greece as well
5720486 the people in greece are kind of crazy after football soccer games they would light things on fire and riot i definitely saw people at basketball games yelling obscenities at the top of their lungs in greek police in full riot gear would come to basketball games the mens games not the womens game they would be hitting people with batons and people would be hitting police officers you feel like you are in a movie sometimes when you see that stuff live we dont really have the same level of passion or its just not socially acceptable to be that completely ridiculous about sports in america we think we are pretty crazy but they totally cross all the lines it was nuts
5720487 i think it was a huge thing moving to such a great place as ames where everyone is really nice and you already have a basketball family looking back on it i cant believe i was ever even nervous about it at all i was 18 and i had never left seattle i had never left home never moved houses that was a really big move for me and you kind of do it on a leap of faith you try to get some good friends and you have your coaches but you kind of rely on yourself in a lot of ways going overseas is the same in a lot of ways the only person you really know you can count on in the beginning is yourself it definitely builds your confidence to know you can do that and i think going away to school was a big first step you cant just leave home and go to europe and live by yourself you kind of have to take baby steps and i think ames was my first experience really being on my own as it is for most people but ames is pretty far from seattle so it was a little bit bigger step going overseas was a lot easier having done that already
5720488 they come when they can everybody has taken a trip to see me my brothers and my parents at least one of my parents has come every year and they come for a long time they usually come for a month and do a little traveling in the area i am in they cook me food and clean my apartment we just hang out my dad is just like he always was he comes to basketball practice i was in istanbul and he wanted to come to practice instead of going to the mosques my mom has to put her foot down they try to see as many games as they can during that time frame these days keeping in contact isnt that difficult the time difference is hard sometimes but it is just a call overseas
5720489 i started an exercise mentorship program in seattle this summer
5720490 its trying to build confidence through exercise and promoting wellness and teaching the girls to take care of themselves
5720491 the players are from the university of washington but next year i am going to expand it i know a lot of the players and i told them about my idea and they were very excited about it and enthusiastic so i worked with some agencies in seattle that work with girls in foster care and got girls through them i just started the workouts and it its been really neat it came out of my own experience during the year all athletes are incredibly busy its like working two full time jobs but in the summer you have this window of time when people only have a couple of classes and they have time to give back to the community i think thats a really great time period that they can give back
5720492 they dont have a lil clone zone or anything like that i dont know why that is i talked to my manager last year about starting some of that stuff last year our company sponsored a kids home in our town where 60 kids lived together so we did something for them at christmas and then we started going to play basketball with them and hung out with them its so great when you have that kind of influence and you can use it in such a powerful way they dont have parents they have these people who take care of them and they are great but they are kind of behind in a lot of things and they dont get a lot they are so appreciative of everything they do get its refreshing to be around kids who really do appreciate what they have it wasnt something that was set up before but our team started seeing these kids all the time and we fell in love with them i think that really influenced me to do something here i just really felt for those kids they have a good living situation but they are still orphaned kids
5720493 i think the coolest thing about playing after college is that you get more mature and you learn more about the game and you learn more about yourself
5720494 its great i am thankful that ive gotten to play im 27 years old and i am still playing at a very high level it wasnt that long ago that women would not have had this opportunity at all so i am very thankful for that and this lifestyle ive gotten to see a lot of the world with basketball its pretty fun
5720495 i think the big 12 tournament was always an incredible experience all of our families were there and half of ames was in kansas city those were really special memories especially since we won i think also the ncaa tournament playing at home in hilton
5720496 ames in general is a special place but hilton was home for four years that was our court we had such great fans and it was a really special place to play knowing that no one wanted to play us there especially in the ncaa tournament i think those are the memories that i will always have knowing that i played in a really big time program on the biggest stage there is in womens basketball in america a lot of people dont ever get that opportunity
5720497 tracy gahan just went back to australia she was up here in seattle visiting me for a week brittany wilkins and i played against each other last year in the eurocup which was really fun we played each other twice actually theres nothing like seeing an old friend and going for coffee in some random european city before you play each other
5720498 i think i mostly remember his piercing blue eyes thats the one thing with coach fennelly hes going to be intense you are in a game and he has something to say and you are looking into those eyes and you know he means business i think players really appreciate that being away from coach fennelly now you learn to appreciate things so much more now than you did when you played for him i think coach fennelly is always in control and he is dead certain on what he wants i think players not only respect that but really appreciate that because they know whats expected of them i think thats good for anybody but in basketball its really nice to know its not fun to play when you are unsure what your coach wants

5720505 it looks like we should have listened to president carter
5720506 the whole function of this is to try to get this president to change his strategy he operates on the premise that if we put enough troops in the middle of a civil war we can give breeding room to a group of people in baghdad to get together and form a strong central government thats a democracy that will not happen in your lifetime or mine

5720534 serious when he said he doesnt want to raise anyones taxes rich or poor
5720535 mccain seems to have found an issue that polls well contrasts with his opponent and is easy to describe if not a short term solution to high gas prices of shore drilling
5720536 600 foot oil tanker collided with a barge on the mississippi river creating a 12 mile oil slick

5720577 tenemos que en jalisco al tomar en cuenta la reforma federal aumenta 500 por ciento esto no es congruente
5720578 la gente de jalisco no est de acuerdo con que se den cinco veces m s de lo que reciben los partidos cuando hay programas sociales prioritarios ese es el tema fundamental y ah no hay mucha ciencia es la decisi n pol tica de estar con la gente y con la sociedad o de incrementar de ese alcance las participaciones de los partidos

5720581 ive been following the red sox since your dad was jerking off
5720582 evidently we didnt do enough work in the last 10 days like i told them its my fault for trying to save them a little bit and not beat them up on the practice field so we came down here and got beat up in the game
5720583 people from the georgian security agencies asked me to block russian sites

5720587 there were threats from viruses we faced disinformation and so on
5720588 i hope that when war is over we will unblock these sites
5720589 the notion that a radical is one who hates his country is na ve and usually idiotic he is more likely one who likes his country more than the rest of us and is thus more disturbed than the rest of us when he sees it debauched he is not a bad citizen turning to crime he is a good citizen driven to despair
5720590 lafu has to earn it back he had his own setback if he really wants that no 1 spot he has to earn it back and take it from ray ray is the one with the first group
5720591 maybe hes just trying to save tuioti mariner or maybe im really the starting right guard
5720592 hisatake has made a somewhat smooth transition to the position despite having little preparation time he was a defensive tackle at college of san mateo before being shifted to offensive tackle when he joined the warriors during the spring of 2007 he had never played on offense before
5720593 the whole entire year i was learning to play tackle they kind of threw me into the fire at guard at first it was tough because guard is a whole other position
5720594 the key he said is to be patient and trust his blocking technique he also had to adjust his block reads going from inside to outside
5720595 he needs a lot of reps but hes getting better every day hes coming along
5720596 i dont want to worry about this battle if i do im going to mess up i want to focus on myself and what i want to get done and what i need to work on every day
5720597 in the next few days well have a set offensive line hopefully well also be healthy we still have a couple of guys dinged up and thats delaying it
5720598 im not an idiot i realize im not going to make it at the other level but im going to make the most out of what i have here were here to be student athletes not athlete students im here to get my degree which is the goal of all college players this day and age you need a degree to go somewhere in life im setting up to get ready for the real world after college life
5720599 im glad the coaches are giving me an opportunity i feel i can contribute to the team
5720600 dowling who transferred from oregon last year and received a uh scholarship in january said he needs 10 credits this coming semester to earn a bachelors degree
5720601 overwhelming but coach mcmackin gave me an opportunity to go to class and miss some practices it helped me out a lot i didnt want to miss practice but i knew i had to get the school work done the good news is im going to get my degree
5720602 catherine baldwin no longer spends two or three hours a day poring over the internet trying to find any mention of her son right wideout malcolm lane choosing instead to use the time to watch him in person during fall camp practices baldwin and her husband michael baldwin were transferred to schofield barracks in wahiawa from germany earlier this year so the family which includes lanes brothers corey and george could be together
5720603 everybody is here my first years here i was very homesick i was just not loving things here just not having fun with my family here it takes a lot of pressure off of me i get to see them whenever i want to see them it makes me happier and it makes me happier around the football field too
5720604 it was a big fight to get to hawaii weve been trying for two years to get here trying to get stationed here so we could be here a lot of people helped our majors got involved and different people helped to get us stationed here
5720605 my groin has been hurting me since the first day of camp and ive been practicing and practicing and its been getting worse and worse to the point where i couldnt run its still hurting me but i have to get out here and do what i can because its getting down to crunch time i just have to be out on the field with everybody else
5720606 but they are going to be rooting for hawaii so thats going to be nice
5720607 he calls every day and we see him when he needs to do the wash or hes hungry but i think its helped him a lot knowing were closer
5720608 shes lying shes trying to make it seem like cause i barely have any free time so i go there once every weekend i dont go there as much as she wants me to but every time im doing laundry or something like that thats what she said shes making little jokes she knows i love her though
5720609 schofield to manoa is a much easier commute for the family who had to deal with a 12 hour time difference and more than 20 hours of travel to keep in touch with lane it will also be a welcome adjustment to see the games in person instead of watching them online at 3 a m
5720610 it was really hard to get him a scholarship because we sent out a lot of packets and a lot of film its difficult i feel sorry for the athletes in germany because its hard for them to get over here
5720611 she said it was also difficult to find out what courses lane needed to take in high school to be academically eligible to play division i football
5720612 i didnt send the tape to hawaii im pretty sure it was tyrone willingham of washington who gave my tape to coach reinebold they didnt have any more scholarships to give out and i feel grateful that somebody who didnt have a spot for me would look out for me in other ways trying to find me a spot on another team it says a lot about him
5720613 the warriors are scheduled to practice at aloha stadium today and thursday in part to use the heat radiating off the fieldturf to better simulate the steamy conditions expected to greet them at florida a week from saturday the stadium practices which are closed to the public also give the team a chance to work with the 40 second play clock and the coaches communication system
5720614 were not really game planning yet we just wanted to run against some of their stuff offensively and defensively were going to pick it up and start game planning and go from there its just sort of an introduction were a little ahead normally for the first game we start on wednesday
5720615 you try to compete your best every day try to get yourself better you never know whats going to happe we all want to see each other do well were all competing but were all good friends too so we want to see each other succeed
5720616 alexander returned to the field yesterday after sitting out the last two practices with a foot injury and was impressive in a 2 minute drill going 4 for 4 in marching the offense downfield in his turn at the controls
5720617 youre never sure how guys are going to react it really wasnt how they were going to react that very second but how they were going to react in the next few days but you look at the next few days and they both came out and worked hard greg just came back yesterday and put in as much effort as he ever has
5720618 youve got to move on if you just sit there and mope around about it its not going to help anyone youre not going to help yourself youre not going to help the team its the coaches decision and rausch has been doing a good job they both have theyre coming along great you cant be upset that someones doing well especially on your own team the only thing you have control over is trying to progress with whatever reps you might have
5720619 the quarterbacks bonded over the summer when rausch and alexander arrived early to participate in voluntary workouts and rausch credited funaki with teaching him the offense
5720620 were a tight knit group we all have fun together its good that theres no contention between our group
5720621 hes been coming along just fine he probably doesnt even need my thoughts or suggestions
5720622 the other two guys are dead even but they have different characteristics where greg slides around the pocket stands in there and throws it inoke can take off and run on you and make the throws i can see us using them both as no 2 in different games its a nice problem to have
5720623 santos and austin know a lot and theyre familiar with the offense and jakes a great student of the game
5720624 hell no you had yours this is all mine hands off you rat bastard
5720625 well sweetie there is a way this could be our coke
5720626 yeah i get that part but just to be sure are you asking me to marry you

5720634 boris johnson has exposed david camerons mantra that britain is broken for what it is piffle
5720635 only this week the tory leader was again saying that our country is broken yet today the mayor of london has been frank in his opposition to his leaders claim which has always been the most cynical nonsense
5720636 in doing so he has signalled that at least one senior conservative is fed up of david cameron running britain down
5720637 claiming that we live in a broken society is a central plank of mr camerons strategy and it is noteworthy that boris johnson has chosen to so comprehensively rubbish it he must have forgotten that its author was his leader

5720659 in 1996 as soon as you saw that the technology existed for a cable network with vastly higher capacity and vastly lower margin cost to be able to do voice calls over the same network you would have said the end game is obvious cable will win and the telcos will go into bankruptcy the only question is how long it will take

5720673 i think the seven wonders of the world are 1 to touch
5720674 after analyzing the data collected by dr bennewitz mr miller related the evidence clearly shows some type of unidentified aerial objects were caught on film however no conclusion could be made whether these objects pose a threat to the manzano coyote canyon areas
5720675 my role in the affair was primarily that of a freelancer providing information on pauls bennewitz current thinking and activities
5720676 simply a pawn in a much larger game as was i
5720677 he played a part in having bennewitz involuntarily committed to the new mexico state mental hospital on three separate occasions
5720678 judging by the positions of the people i knew to be directly involved in it the disinformation definitely had something to do with national security

5720693 even mugabe doesnt take it seriously he says well very small boys like rejoice they discuss free market economy price controls its not politics as such i maintain a very professional intellectual talk which is very difficult to politicize maybe that is why i can still live to laugh about it
5720694 its amazing to me how mugabe has found ways to create and recreate poverty
5720695 thank you ambassador for your very articulate and totally misinformed version of events
5720696 as i think how my day to day life in harare has depleted into stone age survival i wonder how i have tolerated mugabe this long i ask myself what right he has to steal my right to good life and how he can possibly keep insulting the west where almost one million of his citizens are etching a living to sustain his wretched economy
5720697 while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of biofuel

5720703 cape town has always been seen as the most cosmopolitan city in the country so it made sense in every aspect to make the mother city the home of tens rugby in africa
5720704 ive played just one tens tournament but already im a convert it caters for all shapes and sizes while we think cape town is the ultimate venue with the perfect attractions and people here who will help make the tournament a massive success both on and off the field
5720705 with no loose forwards on the pitch it opens things up a bit more and lets the backs have a go
5720706 but at the same time you cant neglect your scrums and line outs and theres even a time and a place for a bit of rucking

5720710 i am more grateful than i can say for the support he gave to hillary in this long last year
5720711 we have to understand we can only keep him alive if the love we felt for him and the love he felt for us is somehow manifest in our lives
5720712 he could have taken a lot of other roads but he chose public service
5720713 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation

5720723 cyber bullying is not under any definition trespass or theft
5720724 cyber bullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
5720725 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
5720726 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
5720727 moreover the vehicle for the cyber bullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000

5720734 for new delhi musharraf was seen as being very keen on sustaining the peace process between the two countries to moving forward in terms of the talks to really agreeing in many ways with india over what it saw as the key issues for example of building confidence between the two countries
5720735 so musharrafs departure for new delhi actually does raise some hopes in terms of a new democratic pakistan but it also raises concerns over whether the new leadership in pakistan that makes decisions on relations with india will really want to move forward in terms of the peace process that musharraf clearly did want to do
5720736 you have of course the prime minister and the foreign minister but you also have the leaders of the two major coalition partners in the government the ppp and the plm n you also have in terms of foreign relations the army and the isi secret service which has a critical role for neighborhood policy issues and you have in some cases the judiciary as well in terms of the legal challenges to the regime and the impact of those challenges on foreign policy
5720737 i dont think its up to gilani in islamabad because whatever dealing india has with a country like pakistan and also whatever dealings pakistan has with afghanistan are determined and underwritten in a sense by the military
5720738 the pakistani military is the arbiter of deciding and calibrating the level of talks with india and the level of relations with india
5720739 but the army itself in pakistan is in a bit of turmoil because the army is anxious to remain in the back seat and not be very overt like with musharraf so in a sense pakistan is in a complete state of flux and chaos india is fairly low down on their radar
5720740 but india on the other hand is very concerned that because of the growth of turmoil inside pakistan india may become a target as a diversionary tactic by the pakistani military and the intelligence services so india has more to fear from chaos in pakistan than pakistan has to fear from the lack of progress in peace talks
5720741 india is a little tentative about dealing with the civilian government in islamabad because over the last three or four months the peace process that began in 2004 under president musharraf has been crumbling partially because of a series of serious bombings in india in which india has accused pakistan of being guilty of interference with its intelligence service and particularly because of the indian embassy bombing in kabul which india claimed along with the cia had been supported by the isi the pakistani spy agency
5720742 it really remains to be seen how they can organize themselves and take the peace process forward because the indian government was somewhat content to meet with musharraf in fact over the last three or four years they had made some progress in peace talks
5720743 what we have seen in the last few months is really a deterioration of relations between musharraf and karzai personally
5720744 the relationship between these two countries is far greater than the personality of their leaders there are a number of factors that will continue regarding the current policies of pakistan toward afghanistan we have clearly concerns over what is happening in the tribal areas in pakistan and the implications in afghanistan the afghans of course have raised this they have also threatened a more proactive military stance so i dont think there will be much of a change in terms of the actual relationship other than the fact that the differing personalities of the two will not really be there that does provide some potential for improvement in presentation at least but it is unlikely to see much of an improvement in substance
5720745 pakistan under musharraf was looking at the issue of islamic extremism in the context of its regional interests
5720746 so there was not always harmony or a common approach to extremism in the area now the civilian government the elected government of pakistan is facing that challenge if the elected government of pakistan can stay united and respond to these challenges in a unified way and also control the interference of the isi intelligence services they might be able to respond in an effective way otherwise the disunity among different factions in pakistans elected government can create a vacuum that vacuum can be exploited by the extremist groups they will have a free hand and expand their crossborder attacks into afghanistan
5720747 from washingtons perspective the trend that we are looking at more assertive policy both in terms of rhetoric and at times in terms of substance will continue
5720748 washington is going toward an election date very soon later this year so there will be more pressure for washington to deal firmly with pakistan i think what will happen is that washington will have to broaden its contacts in pakistan the range of officials at a very senior level that washington has been dealing with now is far broader earlier it was fairly safe to deal largely only with musharraf today that is not the case so there are more complexities and concerns
5720749 the current round of agitation in kashmir for the first time in almost two decades has nothing really to do with pakistan
5720750 it is purely a home grown problem which is very complicated over the transfer of land to hindus in the kashmir valley which is muslim dominated but the agitations that are going on in kashmir are definitely disturbing because they are pro pakistan indian planners believe that pakistan is in such turmoil that it cannot really take advantage of indias vulnerability in kashmir but it is only a matter of time before that situation changes and indias confrontation over kashmir with pakistan begins all over again

5720769 even with those very very strong prices milk producers are still looking at substantially higher costs of production

5720773 i wonder how obama reconciles this favorite biblical passage with his stand on abortion
5720774 although weve had a president whos opposed to abortion over the last eight years abortions have not gone down
5720775 i dont normally do this sort of thing but i had to express my gratitude to you people for developing such a remarkable cosmeceutical ive been using lifecell now for 3 months and the change in the texture and feel of my skin is simply amazing my crows feet look practically gone and my skin looks years younger after the first month i wasnt quite sure if there was a lot of improvement but when i looked at pictures of my face that were taken just before i started the treatment i was really amazed at the change and that was just after a month its been 3 months now and i cant even express how smooth and healthy looking my skin is i just had to write this because its so refreshing to use a cosmeceutical that actually delivers on its word and then some thank you so much

5720781 i purchased 12 goats two cows five pigs and still have in stock adequate food stuffs to sustain me for a year
5720782 we dont want to continue sitting and waiting for the government or some humanitarian agency to tell us what to do since peace has returned
5720783 its unfair to keep on demanding aid from the government and international humanitarian agencies
5720784 we pray that the peace we have should be sustained so that we catch up with other parts of the country in terms of development
5720785 we want to ensure that the land in the north is properly utilised by helping people acquire tractors ox ploughs oxen seeds and money for business
5720786 the institution has a customer base of 167 000 people across the country and a loan portfolio of valued at about 30 million dollars we want more people in this region to come on board because they suffered for so long
5720787 we tried our best to plant adequate food this season but its been damaged as a result of the drought which has continued for two months
5720788 there is a serious fear that the area will be hit by food shortage or famine as a result of this unexpected situation
5720789 our focus this year is to increase the cotton production from the 9 000 bales which we managed last year to 50 000 and to help farmers increase their income
5720790 that is why we are distributing the seeds to the farmers rather than waiting for a market based demand
5720791 cotton has been our major source of income right from the british time but we are unhappy with the way the government is handling the distribution of seeds
5720792 under this project we are looking at how to enhance food security and help school dropouts acquire vocational skills
5720793 its advantageous to us because the more we produce the more we shall earn
5720794 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia
5720795 our reporters are working in some very risky areas and are taking on some very edgy topics
5720796 i think its going to show some deficiencies in our system i hope so
5720797 i hope it also shows some of the strong points that we believe we have which is being able to react to an emergency with kind of outside the box thinking
5720798 i would describe the rangers role our canadian rangers as the front lines of asserting canadian sovereignty here in the arctic
5720799 if you sit back especially in some climate thats very warm like down south it is easy to be an armchair critic
5720800 but you have to be up here and survive the conditions through the winter and recognize when weathers bad thats when things go wrong thats when you need the natural skills of our rangers

5720839 the shares in question were not disposed in fact it was a grant in connection with a new position and drawing a comparison at all to lyors sale is completely wrong if you look in the filing for our new head of global human resources warning pdf link youll see in box 4 in table 2 that it states that this was a grant
5720840 lets have this old guy sing songs hes clearly not familiar with
5720841 and although he has his moments of sentimentality on john lennons grow old with me and the velvet undergrounds jesus campbell is still a formidable interpreter of song who even overcomes heavy handed production to remind us why he was always our favorite charismatic pop music cowboy
5720842 much like johnny cashs late in life work with producer rick rubin these are serious recordings where campbell locates the emotional thread in meaningful lyrics from those with different backgrounds than his the best cuts his takes on jackson brownes these days u2s all i want is you and john lennons grow old with me own a timeless beauty that bridges generations and cultures
5720843 overall the tracks couldve benefited from less showy musicianship in favor of a naked spotlight on campbells world weary perspective certainly at age 72 campbell has earned the right to just sing it as he sees it
5720844 he has picked well written and age appropriate songs jackson brownes weary reflection these days composed in the late 60s when the songwriter was a teenager seems more relevant and moving coming from a 72 year old with a lived in voice even better the replacements wistful sadly beautiful about a father watching his child mature has a perfect foil in campbell

5720862 we havent given up the whale is still healthy we will try again to encourage it back out to deeper water
5720863 we are seeking help and advice of international experts including seaworld in san diego to see if there are any additional techniques or options we can try this is a unique difficult and sad situation
5720864 its not impossible and the fact it is snuggling up to a boat is a good sign it could be done
5720865 and the fact it has never been tried before in the world is a good reason to do it

5720869 but hes back bigger and bolder and is still a great dancer and his manager the turtle will probably be joining him in a new video soon
5720870 it was the word psycho which is closely related to the diagnostic terms of psychosis and psychotic used in conjunction with the bears behaviour when he got the bad text and the fear engendered by his behaviour that offended people
5720871 we acknowledge no on is setting out to cause offence but you are not going to have a ringtone making fun of someone with cancer
5720872 we have to be realistic were not going to be able to do much with the big movie moguls
5720873 they might welcome it to add fuel to their fire
5720874 i know quite a few women who have to return to work early because of financial reasons
5720875 obviously it is of extreme concern to us so we are making investigations and have notified docs
5720876 there is considerable risk involved so we treat it seriously but there is also the chance that the kids may have just been playing in the area
5720877 at this stage docs cannot confirm that the children were living in the bin and were not just playing in the vicinity
5720878 however concerns remain that the children were reportedly in the area on school days were not dressed for the winter weather and were without any adult supervision
5720879 once the children have been located docs will work to secure their ongoing safety and well being
5720880 police have previously received reports and conducted investigations into the receipt of this kind of material
5720881 we encourage parents whose children come across any forms of child exploitation images and videos or other inappropriate material to contact their nearest police station so it can be investigated
5720882 we are aware of cases where children have been unwittingly exposed to child pornograhy this poses a serious risk and parents need to be vigilaint about their childrens usage of peer to peer networks
5720883 however any such feature is imperfect at best parents should monitor childrens activity
5720884 we dont make any money everything we earn goes back into the community
5720885 this stopwork meeting is to involve all members therefore no minimal supervision of students is authorised
5720886 these stoppages mean a disruption to childrens education as well as a massive inconvenience to parents

5720890 its a tough one but well say its better here in australia only because all our family are here its home
5720891 i amp squo m a little disappointed that the well kept secret is now out
5720892 if for some reason you are not willing to lead leave it to the rest of us
5720893 my starting point is a sigh of relief that were on the right track the fact that there is a bali action plan is an important development
5720894 in the broad scheme of things the world has taken a step forward and now theres a much better chance of an agreement
5720895 i had few expectations for bali but at least it created a little sense of forward motion i suppose
5720896 everything that would have indicated a sense of scientific urgency was taken out
5720897 this is the best agreement that could have been negotiated with the bush administration at the table
5720898 but it is extremely important in that it lays out the scope and a timetable for the negotiations and now everyone has committed to that
5720899 if you see the glass as half empty you can say they should have come up with clearer long term goals
5720900 but if the glass is half full you say that everything that needs to be on the table is now on the table
5720901 by comparison the u s commitments were mealy mouthed and minor
5720902 china is clearly responsible for the largest wedge of emissions in the future but the united states is still the biggest roadblock
5720903 the u s is not going to be influential by telling china what to do it has to lead by example
5720904 we want success here in bali we will go forward and join consensus
5720905 even if you say sugar a hundred times your mouth wont taste sweet
5720906 the biggest hurdle in the way of democracy has been removed
5720907 i hope that all political parties find young leaders to compete in the elections because we have to train ourselves in the practice of peaceful succession
5720908 no no we want you we want you for ever
5720909 but there are things that bring good colors here in alaska
5720910 i love going up in the mountains in september here to see the yellows of the willows and the orange of the blueberries and the red of the bearberries and the purpley fireweed
5720911 one of the things that is really critical is cool nights
5720912 starting in september if it starts to get cool but not below freezing if you have clear cool days and cool nights it stimulates fall color
5720913 its all a pattern but its never the same which is whats really cool about it
5720914 fall will begin mid august and it will be peaking there the end of august and first week of september
5720915 and then all of a sudden those bright colors are gone and youre into winter pretty quickly
5720916 we have a more temperate climate the fall colors kick in about the third week of september and into the first week of october
5720917 are always the first to sell out the high demand for the last part of august is because of the fall colors
5720918 near the coast is the last place youll find color
5720919 from mid september to late october we see a variation of fall color rolling through from the western upper peninsula to the southeastern portion of the state
5720920 the lakes tend to pop toward the last moment mid to late october
5720921 that makes it look like evening in the middle of the day
5720922 its not uncommon to see trees turning colors sometimes even later than the first week of november
5720923 in the fall the leaves of the tree turn beautiful shades of pink and magenta
5720924 coming in and out of yosemite either on highway 41 from the south or highway 120 from the northwest there are a lot of dogwood trees right next to the highway

5720931 im the internal affairs investigator jim bravura and im just hounding max payne crazy thing about that is whenever you see mark wahlberg hes usually playing those dominate characters so this is the time im the one whos dominate
5720932 i get to hound him trust me its the best scene in the movie when im hounding the hell out of mark wahlberg because im the boss
5720933 im on max paynes heels the entire movie just trying to figure things out as he figures things out im kind of figuring things out too
5720934 hes bossing other people around a lot of guys in the force dont like him just because hes always one step ahead of them i love playing those aggressive roles
5720935 mccain views this as the one decision that he has total utter nonnegotiable control over
5720936 james has been around as long as we have and weve always talked about playing together
5720937 to really try to say hey were not antagonistic it was more than an olive branch i mean we genuinely and it all sounds very fragile and dafodilish now but more than an olive branch i think it was a statement of principle on our part

5720948 when we started charity water the first thing we did was build a well and take a picture of it then we told the story of the lives changed in that community to everyone back home weve been doing that ever since we want to show the immense need for clean water and how that looks really not through statistics or numbers but by looking at individual lives it affects weve found this is our most powerful tool armed with a nikon d200 we send photographers into the field to document the work being done and to bring back proof once its finished along with gps coordinates and photos of every well they usually bring back phenomenal stories of lives changed and communities revived

5720955 our analysis clearly shows incredible growth in online pc gaming proof that this industry is far stronger than anyone has reported
5720956 theres been a lot of trend pieces about pc gaming is dying and the decline of the pc when thats absolutely not true and in fact its not dying
5720957 considering we tried to sell bejeweled outright to more than one industry giant back in the early days of our company and got no takers even after reducing our asking price to 60 000 this little game has done all right for itself

5720967 yo s lo quiero que l est bien que est feliz en el equipo
5720968 creo que robinho se va a quedar con nosotros ha sido un jugador importante el a o pasado
5720969 creo que tiene mucho m s para dar y creo que es uno de los jugadores a los que hay que exigirles porque es uno de los jugadores que marca la diferencia
5720970 no lo veo tan mal y creo que se va a quedar con nosotros ya hab a dicho que tiene mucho m s para darle al madrid y es uno de los jugadores que marca la diferencia
5720971 yo lo he vivido y siempre es mucho m s exigente tener que estar al m ximo nivel y al cien por cien en tu equipo y tu selecci n y m s cuando se trata de espa a u holanda
5720972 si no vas convocado sabes que cada mes tienes una semana m s tranquila como esta y un par de d as de descanso con una edad como la de ruud y con todo lo que ha jugado creo que es un alivio y a nivel de equipo nos vendr muy bien
5720973 lo veo muy bien aqu tiene muchos holandeses y eso facilita su adaptaci n todo son gente muy buena y fiable para un vestuario rafael se ha adaptado r pido y estamos muy contentos con l
5720974 en nuestro estadio ellos van a estar un poquito m s atr s y esperando esa contra que a ellos les gusta pero esperamos que en el bernabeu y con nuestra gente nos metamos en plena temporada
5720975 estamos en pretemporada y faltan muchas cosas pero en el partido de ida le hemos dado al equipo contrario lo que ellos quer an porque sus principales virtudes son el robo del bal n y la contra y nosotros hemos perdido muchas pelotas en zona peligrosa y ellos tienen gente de calidad
5720976 las cosas hay que valorarlas fr amente y no valorarlo s lo por un partido porque el madrid siempre que pierde un partido se dicen muchas cosas pero hay que tomarse estas situaciones con tranquilidad porque si ganamos la supercopa en casa van a decir que no necesitamos fichajes supongo que el entrenador y el apartado t cnico del club han analizado esta situaci n hace mucho tiempo por lo que va a ser la temporada y lo que nos va a exigir
5720977 son diez a os aqu pero lo que tengo claro es que esta temporada quiero que sea diferente a la anterior no por minutos jugados sino por mis sensaciones no estuve contento con mi a o pasado no me qued bien despu s de la lesi n y no estuve a la altura de lo que he dado siempre
5720978 este a o he afrontado de otra manera esta pretemporada y lo nico que quiero es que el mister sepa que me tiene de verdad para afronta una temporada dura y que estoy al cien por cien por y para el equipo
5720979 seguir jugando mientras siga disfrutando del f tbol y cuando vea que soy prescindible en ese momento igual har otra cosa el real madrid te exige mucho
5720980 seria un error centrarnos s lo en la d cima al final lo que te juegas cada domingo es la liga la champions es muy bonita pero la puedes ganar o no y es muy complicado y depende m s de c mo est s en marzo sin embargo la liga es al d a y si te centras en europa puede ser que te quedes sin nada
5720981 estoy contento por l porque yo he tenido la suerte de estar con pep en la selecci n fue un pedazo de jugador de los que m s clase han tenido en la selecci n y por c mo ve el f tbol creo que es el entrenador perfecto para el barcelona
5720982 tambi n es importante rese ar todo lo que l ha significado para el barcelonismo hacerte una idea de un equipo por la pretemporada no es una visi n real para ejemplo nosotros que el a o pasado hicimos una mala pretemporada y despu s estuvimos muy bien en la liga
5720983 vicente es un hombre al que tenemos mucho cari o le deseo todo lo mejor no creo que cambie mucho porque lo que se ha hecho est muy bien y aunque cada entrenador tiene sus gustos l ha dicho que cuando uno gana no puede cambiar s lo continuar
5720984 hemos roto el maleficio de los cuartos que creaba ansiedad para jugar se ha ganado y a partir de ahora el equipo lo afrontar todo de distinta manera y creo que la selecci n espa ola puede hacer un gran papel en el pr ximo mundial
5720985 if the web firm is incorporated you stand a better chance of that contract actually meaning something

5721410 its unlikely that within that short time frame youll get everything you want without some sort of shift in distribution
5721411 we use the word bias in certain areas of our study but we also talk about blind spots
5721412 people are operating on assumptions of what old is and what elderly patients need
5721413 we were surprised that this was a recurrence of something we saw in the late 1990s this is something we have to revisit periodically
5721414 and we want to share it with other states and ems systems because if its happening in maryland its likely happening everywhere
5721415 trauma is often seen as a disease of the young
5721416 but thats changing you have a fairly active aging population that is playing sports being active and getting injured
5721417 no one ever admits they have a bias they say they know someone who does something biased
5721418 basically its difficult to get a handle on what bias is so instead of defining bias we wanted to show that people behaved differently and find a way to fix the problem
5721419 sometimes the younger doctors see a person being evaluated and it turns out to be negative and the patient is sent home
5721420 part of the problem is everybodys got aches and pains its hard to tell is that a broken hip or something else
5721421 this is much more complicated in older people there are many issues that make injury in the elderly much more difficult to get your arms around
5721422 preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
5721423 it used to be sort of expected that there was a phase of life where you had children and a lot of women arent doing that now
5721424 clearly women have competing alternatives for the use of their time with the labor market and employment being one and delayed marriage which has been another trend
5721425 the interesting question is has it stopped is this it or will we see even higher rates of childlessness among future generations
5721426 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires
5721427 i am a much more patient person than i have ever been
5721428 the only way you can make it through is to have a lot of love
5721429 corolla offers five trim levels for 2008 vs three for 2008
5721430 one of the handsomest pieces of sheet metal in toyotas u s lineup
5721431 is that a cool thing to say in this day and age
5721432 editorial boards examine their selection processes for unconscious bias with regard to gender and conscious bias
5721433 for 2009 we will start supporting other markets outside of the u s at 2 5ghz and in other spectrum profiles
5721434 its one of those chicken and egg situations its dependent on the development of networks how much coverage they have and what the underlying demand is
5721435 the power situation in kandahar is very unreliable we rely on our generator for a lot of the day
5721436 right now were the largest computer lab in the province with 50 terminals so were very happy with where it is
5721437 in a business youre already going to have a network the infrastructure to power the pcs the space and so on
5721438 in situations like this one in kandahar they dont have power so youre faced with questions of what size generator do i need
5721439 what were hoping to do is to introduce solar power into the mix even if we can just reduce our reliance on our generators like only using one that will make a big difference
5721440 if youve got someone who is a relatively experienced system administrator youre going to be okay
5721441 this is one of the hardest regions because there isnt that knowledge of it readily available
5721442 this is usable by someone with very basic pc skills weve tried to not overcomplicate things
5721443 the x series kit takes about 10 minutes to set up

5721459 i was quite reluctant at first but i know that this school is pretty good in fencing
5721460 we will of course be fitter but since we are able to think faster it will help us academically
5721461 fencing helps me to relieve stress and i can think fast on the spot
5721462 when we first started fencing in 2001 we only had a handful of other schools now we have 15 schools doing fencing so its getting more and more popular

5721520 surely then the real aggression in yugoslavia began with the western recognition of slovenia and croatia the territorial integrity of a state yugoslavia that was voluntarily created and which had existed since december 1918 was swept aside in 1991 new state recognition policy proved to be an inventive method of destroying long standing sovereign independent states when several rich and powerful states decide to take a sovereign independent state apart through the policy of recognition how is this state supposed to defend itself there can be no deterrence or defense against this form of destruction
5721521 the disposal of human wastes is a subject normally buried in euphemism and avoidance at least in public privately every single person on the planet is intimately concerned on a day to day even hour to hour basis with the need to relieve themselves in a congenial place and fashion the physiological necessity of excretion cannot be averted even if it cannot be spoken of no one can attain the purity of the perfect saint who manages to digest every single thing he or she consumes a power that certain holy men in the ancient world were believed to possess even the most rigid toilet training can enable a person to postpone their visits to the rest room only for a certain length of time every day each human being emits an average of slightly less than 100 grams of feces and roughly one and a half litres of urine even though this regular process of bodily evacuation may not be thought of as dishonourable and base a phrase from victorian england it is nonetheless regarded as noxious and unmentionable by most of the human race this is an unspoken subject in almost every culture except in the context of ribaldry and scatological humour the organs of defecation are close to or identified with those used for sex another delicate subject the subspecies of engineers who preoccupy themselves with mire are viewed askance as if they were mildly touched and in the uk plumbers earn more than other kinds of household fixers because of bravery in the face of ordure the very word toilet at least upon the anglo saxon tongue has an awkward and embarrassed ring and its use is often regarded as vulgar that there is a worldwide sanitary crisis is indisputable over 40 per cent of people in the developing world still depend on a bucket a bush the banks of a stream a backstreet or some other sheltered place for their several daily emissions
5721522 why does this remarkable species devise a vastly laborious and time consuming system for channeling its piss and shite into its water supply and then expend equally vast amounts of time and effort on partly removing its piss and shite from its water supply
5721523 are the males of this species addicted to kinky sexual practices such as drinking girls piss if so they should just go to a prostitute or broach the subject of piss drinking with their wives its a bad mistake on their part because for one thing the female hormones from the contraceptive pill are being excreted in girls piss into the water supply via the flush toilet then the men are drinking recycled girls piss when they turn on the tap and the female hormones in the water supply are making the men of this species infertile and making them grow breasts

5721528 this is evident in our progress report on the various projects such as stadia construction transport and ict infrastructure and our security plan that was submitted to fifa in june among many other milestones we have since achieved as a country
5721529 the focus of the partnership will be to establish mutual cooperation to improve policing in both countries by exchanging knowledge skills and experience in relation to law enforcement investigation of crime crime prevention public order and public safety
5721530 the establishment of partnerships between countries in the form of specific bilateral agreements ensured that countries remained abreast of international tendencies and developments to counter or neutralise these tendencies
5721531 domestic violence and prevention as well as training and education are the main subjects in the field we will work in close cooperation with the local authorities
5721532 trust and close cooperation between the police and the people are essential for tackling safety and security problems in society
5721533 providing effective and efficient transport at an affordable cost is our primary objective and we are well on track to meet these commitments
5721534 the two loop in the inner city and link the orlando stadium with ellis park by passing through the joubert park area
5721535 this initiative will certainly play a significant role in helping to integrate and transform the city and provide an affordable and efficient bus transport system that johannesburg can be proud of
5721536 delays in any of the key areas obviously impact the entire project but after a comprehensive investigation of our progress to date we are confident that we will have all the necessary systems in place to service the confederations cup next year

5721618 capitol hill has jimi hendrix so we just want to give the man his due and recognition for all the wonderful things hes done for our neighbourhood
5721619 i think kapow has found themselves a wonderful way to make more money poking fun at paul allen than selling coffee
5721620 im pretty sceptical anyone could do a 300 foot statue anywhere in the neighbourhood or anywhere in the city
5721621 i think paul allen has done a lot for the area
5721622 if youve got buildings going up too tall for people to see the lake a 300 foot statue is kind of speaking to that isnt it
5721623 no the fact is at a certain point in time like john said they were more famous than some peoples god and its the songs that did it and all of us who were alive when they were happening are part of a beatles generation forever
5721624 i remember standing in front of the mirror in the bedroom singing into a hairbrush with my friends that was the beginning of everything
5721625 they were one of the first bands maybe the first to have a wide range of merchandise licensing their name to everything from lunch boxes to bobble heads and probably the first band ever to fill stadiums when they played shay stadium so since then its been done but they were the first
5721626 with the people we have left on the show its really important that the public thinks of all the performances and how theyve accumulated and how much evolution has happened the performers are better now than they ever were its all about the journey to today its not about who did well last week its about the entire journey throughout the process
5721627 earls a stylist earl needs something with a lot of soul the lyrical content was perfect so i think with a little help from my friends just seemed right for him
5721628 earl is a master of the chorus his tone is so recognizable and the songs he chooses for himself are so quintessentially earl
5721629 hes not self conscious on stage which is something thats pretty rare as well as the fact that the guy is such a natural musician and by that i mean he has tons of natural rhythm
5721630 even something as weird as rock n roll suicide where he was able to get up and just prowl the stage and do his thing earl takes every song he does and every performance he does and makes you believe hes completely comfortable in that moment
5721631 when he comes on stage i think what canada gets is this regular guy who enjoys music beyond belief and just gets into it its as simple as that and it makes him absolutely loveable
5721632 first of all i gotta say that the band was awesome
5721633 i guess we were kind of right in picking that song for you you did exactly what i thought you would do with it it was spectacular really powerful
5721634 the judges choice has always been my favourite show in the top 10 regardless of what theme of the week or whatever its our opportunity to give you guys a leg up and when you guys do us proud like that earl im telling you it makes this all worthwhile well done
5721635 for mookie we chose come together that was a no brainer because for mookie its really all about the physical performance hes very very charismatic and its got such a great hook that suits i think what he represents hes already got the beatle hair so hes ready
5721636 the song come together reminds me of mookie the staccato type vocal and it allows him with the rhythm of that song for a lot of movement
5721637 mookies done some really eclectic songs from james brown to the kinks he shows a real understanding of the history of rock music and where its come from
5721638 he reminds me of those amazing british stars like richard ashcroft from the verve like bono in his younger days theres something uk brit about him all the way
5721639 he does give us that unexpected thing every week and its all about whats mookie going to do this week now people are seeing wow this guy is special
5721640 mookie it was the combination first of all the whole style that you have going on just the blend of the rock the soul the pop plus all of that back phrasing you were doing just one great big jumbo pot of mmm mmm good
5721641 i dont know how many people really know that song was actually taken from an old blues song and i knew you would figure that out or i had a feeling you would and you really captured the old blues soul funk of that thing and to be honest i think that you can get really carried away sitting here but i think that was the best version of that song ive ever heard
5721642 when you think of theo you have to think of theo at the piano
5721643 i think our job with picking the songs is to highlight the best things about them and make them really shine
5721644 theo is able to deliver these grandiose songs with relative ease
5721645 i think it was important that we picked something that allows him to play piano the big orchestrations the big vocal moments
5721646 the long and winding road theo has the vocal chops to pull it off and it suits him
5721647 theo shows really strong command of the melody and passion and that song lends to those two things
5721648 its a really strong beautiful melody and i think it gives him a lot of room to show off his pipes
5721649 i find he loses himself in the song he becomes one with the song if he can accomplish that with a beatles song like long and winding road i think were gonna have a landmark performance for him
5721650 theo the only reason i didnt give you a standing ovation is because i have to talk first
5721651 our expectations for you and that song and the two of you together were like whatever through the roof and thats exactly what you did your command for melody your voice and the clarity and your piano playing its all about you youre awesome straight up
5721652 i thought you made some really strong choices in the arrangement that you were able to show off some of that operatic training the ability to transfer to your head voice and do some other things they were really strong i dont know if weve ever had a male singer on this show with the kind of virtuoso skill that you show it was very transcendent i really enjoyed it
5721653 when mitch sang love this town all of a sudden i got what it was that i loved about him so much
5721654 there is an honesty in mitch macdonald that i just relate to
5721655 certain songs you pick for certain people and if you listen to the song in my life it is kind of a mitch song he really is at his best when hes singing quiet heartfelt really melodic songs
5721656 hes got a really unique tone that with that kind of melody line can sound super melodic
5721657 he has an ability to express himself through those kinds of songs so in my life is the perfect fit for him
5721658 there is something about mitch macdonald that makes you long for home in my life fits him like a glove
5721659 farley said something earlier to theo and he talked about how ready you guys are and i think its really great that were doing beatles songs now because i think if we had done it any earlier i dont think we wouldve reached the pinnacle that were reaching now and i hope the rest of the shows and i hope youre still here because i think youve got a good shot will live up to tonights show because tonights show is one of my favourite ever and that was a fantastic performance by the way
5721660 ive got to agree with you jake id also like to say mitch that was probably in my opinion the best vocal performance youve given so far i mean it was pure
5721661 ive also got to say for the record collectively you guys are absolutely the best top 5 weve ever had theres no question about it
5721662 drew is this multi instrumentalist guy who really defines himself by the combination of his voice and what hes playing while my guitar gently weeps is that moment where youre playing the guitar but youre singing about playing the guitar
5721663 we felt we needed a song that allowed his voice to shine and allow him to be emotional because i dont think hes done that yet
5721664 when drew sang creep he was passionate he was physical he was expressive and i think thats what he needs to do to win over the entire country
5721665 when he hits those notes and he holds them he does that magic moment
5721666 drew has to be really conscious of singing great verses and not just waiting for the moment when he makes the chandelier shake while my guitar gently weeps has some opportunity to sing up into the stratosphere but its a really strong melody line and you must sing a great melody before you get to those moments
5721667 you have some big shoes to fill when you think that george harrison wrote the song eric clapton played the guitar on it jeff healy covered it and drew wright just re invented it great job my friend
5721668 what we were hoping from you was that you would be expressive and emotive and i just said to zack facetiously i think that meant something to him and zack said thats the point that was the point fantastic
5721669 ive been a non believer in certain choices that you made but dude that was heartfelt and honest and the first time i truly believed in you i thought that was phenomenal
5721670 why do you refuse to respect the wall between church and state you know that the mixing of religion and government for centuries has led to slaughter
5721671 why should you be surprised or outraged when there is an act of retaliation

5721679 in order to fully realize the vision of apb we choose to standardize our development on geforce gpus and nvidia physx technology the combination of which has given our developers the power and freedom to deliver the first action and physics based combat gameplay into the massively multiplayer online space
5721680 no of course its not done i think the game looks absolutely fantastic but its going to look even more absolutely fantastic when its released
5721681 but i think it really brings out the best parts of being a republican youre going to be pushed on what you believe in and what you stand for every day
5721682 the nato membership was clear that russia had violated international laws as well as the rules of the international game
5721683 i am delighted that i am going to be able to go to georgia to report on real nato unity
5721684 unity that russia must abide by the ceasefire agreement and withdraw its troops and a unity that there must be new practical and political support for georgia as it seeks to defend itself and ensure that its territory is respected that its independence and sovereignty is recognised but also that it starts on the route to nato membership that was set out in may
5721685 i think there was a real feeling in the nato meeting today that russia has failed to live up to its commitments and that has serious consequences for the trust that is placed in russia as an international partner
5721686 russia wants to be a respected international player but it can only be so if it lives up to its responsibilities
5721687 that is the political drive that will ensure that russia lives up to its commitment to withdraw its troops but also that it doesnt make further threats to other neighbours who treasure their own independence
5721688 the quick deployment of international monitors is also vital the uk will play its full part in this
5721689 the scale of russian military activity is very large and that is why georgians are talking about an invasion and why the rest of the world not just in the eu but elsewhere around the un are saying that russia must live up to the commitments it has made to withdraw to before the august 7 boundaries
5721690 what we are going to agree today is a special mechanism that will bind nato and georgia together a nato georgia commission that will take forward that commitment to georgian membership
5721691 we have not been debating timelines today what we have been debating is the route map
5721692 the route map involves practical co operation as well as political co operation between georgia the georgian government the georgian military and nato
5721693 i dont think that is very significant i talked with condi rice last week about how we had to make sure there was proper engagement with the georgian government and we agreed that she would go before todays nato meeting and i would go straight afterwards
5721694 i spoke to the prime minister about this issue yesterday as i have previously
5721695 this is an international crisis in which the government at all levels is acting in a unified and effective way
5721696 it was a concentration camp and he was the boss
5721697 it sends the message that the colombian judiciary is incapable of handing out justice or even worse that three americans are worth more than dozens of colombians
5721698 what he did to us for seven years was what nothing
5721699 he was tough but he also could be very nice
5721700 he liked to talk politics and talked a lot about being a young man in the liberal party hunted down by rivals in the conservative party
5721701 the guerrillas created and formed the organisation based on peasants and children they took
5721702 i do not think he was 11 years old and at the meeting where they formed the farc but its very possible that they took him to join their ranks at that age
5721703 the person who is captured is captured the one who is killed is killed they are replaced thats how war works
5721704 open source an open question for red hat and others
5721705 software supplier red hat is racking up growth figures that much of techdom might envy sales rose 32 to 157 million in the quarter ended may 31 and profits climbed a respectable 7
5721706 some open source companies have not truly figured that out
5721707 mad dogs fans are passionate about their sports and passionate about where they get their sports news and commentary from these are the listeners that any audio entertainment company would want
5721708 having mad dog on sirius and xm will fuel subscriber growth and create new and exciting opportunities for advertisers choose whatever sports analogy you want this is a big win
5721709 no other sports talk radio comes close to what i will be able to do with sirius xm radio i get to create a whole channel of my kind of sports talk and am very excited to join sirius xm which has the largest collection of sports properties in the history of radio consisting of virtually every major sport including mlb nfl nascar and the nhl
5721710 with football season about to kick off and all the pennant races heating up i cant wait to get on the air and talk to the 18 5 million sirius xm radio subscribers around the country
5721711 mad dog is a national personality and now he has a radio audience that spans the country already a regular on national television including the late show with david letterman mad dog will now be heard every day by listeners across the nation he is now unleashed and the result will be a compelling and informative channel with totally unique access and attitude we are thrilled he has chosen to join us as we deliver fans the very best in sports talk radio
5721712 with the huge sports audiences sirius and xm have it is fitting that our first major talent announcement following the merger would be mad dog
5721713 subscribers get the programming they love today and new options in the future our stockholders benefit from the subscriber growth and increased advertising revenues that mad dog will certainly bring
5721714 oh my god my baby is going to be on the same bus as 4th graders
5721715 obviously if anyone thinks he can kill our citizens our soldiers and officers who are serving as peacekeepers and go unpunished we will never allow this
5721716 anyone who tries this will receive a devastating response for this we have all the means economic and political and military if anyone had illusions about this some time ago then they must part with those illusions now
5721717 we do not want to aggravate the situation but we want to be respected and our government to be respected and our people to be respected and our values
5721718 success i did it i won an olympic medal everybody on winning a silver medal i am completely happy and still in complete disbelief that i was able to achieve this feat im not joking its a tough loss but im on cloud nine i congratulated phelps and his coach bob bowman im just glad the race was fun to watch for everyone it was a pleasure for me really
5721719 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5721720 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me i feel very sorry but theres really nothing i could do
5721721 i dont think mobile search is on the radar for most companies because its just not that important a channel to them so why would they invest in it
5721722 from a brand perspective its slightly different for us because we have a mobile based tv product so we focused on that and made sure the content worked in that environment if thats not part of your core business then im not sure why you would have a specific mobile presence yell of course provides a very good mobile service but thats core to its business
5721723 i dont see how it helps shareholders or share price in any meaningful way nor do i see it as a signal about warners ambitions they bought travellers tales for more than scis market value so they are clearly willing to invest in development talent
5721724 it seems odd that they dont pursue game ip although perhaps they intend only to make games using warner bros ip

5721728 eighty percent of the experts say that the united states has focused too much on the war in iraq and not enough on the war in afghanistan
5721729 almost 70 percent recommend that the majority of u s forces be withdrawn and redeployed to afghanistan and the persian gulf in the next 18 months
5721730 the worst is yet to come in the u s

5721732 we have already made many improvements to mobileme but we still have many more to make we are working very hard to make mobileme a great service we can all be proud of we know that mobilemes launch has not been our finest hour and we truly appreciate your patience as we turn this around
5721733 the transition from mac to mobileme was rockier than we had hoped
5721734 while we are making a lot of improvements the mobileme service is still not up to our standards we are extending subscriptions 60 days free of charge to express appreciation for our members patience as we continue to improve the service

5721756 with 47 million uninsured and 25 million underinsured people in america the deepening health care crisis is jeopardizing the enormous progress we have made against life threatening diseases such as cancer
5721757 to win the war on cancer which will kill more than 560 000 people in america this year we must improve access to quality affordable health care throughout the country
5721758 our hospitals and caregivers see first hand the effects that lack of coverage and access have for many people
5721759 we must keep reform at the top of our national priority list
5721760 health care reform is a moral imperative as well as an urgent practical necessity cha and catholic hospitals across the country support a health care system that serves and protects the dignity of everyone
5721761 meaningful health care reform will only happen if it is the top and earliest domestic priority of the next president and congress
5721762 our diverse organizations will work together to help make that happen
5721763 the healthcare situation has reached crisis levels our nations job creators the small business owners and mom and pop stores in our communities are struggling with unsustainable and ever increasing healthcare costs small firms have seen health insurance increases of 129 percent over the last eight years and they are paying more for the same benefits than their larger counterparts by nearly 20 percent
5721764 the healthcare situation is unsustainable if it continues like this our nations leaders must make healthcare reform a priority and it must address small businesses concerns our nations job creators can afford no less
5721765 i was upset about the part of me being sold for 2 million
5721766 at times like this nobody is trying to sell me i could have come out and said oh yeah cam got bought out but i didnt go that route they just gotta watch me move we gonna make it hot
5721767 im just gonna say a lot of big records i was on a good portion of those records or asked to be on a good portion of those records that lil wayne was on along with him not like they asked me before they asked him or vice versa i know i was on a good portion of those records cause the i cant feel my face thing we were pushing that hard people wanted to get both of us i couldnt go as far as the clearances i could do my verse then it got to the point where i couldnt go there with people because i didnt want them to think that it was me being the bad guy not clearing stuff i didnt want that on my name so i would let people know i cant really if you wanna just put it out on the mixtapes we could do that all day the fans definitely missed out on a lot of juelz due to my contract
5721768 i tell people i couldnt do business with him but i will say he gave me the biggest chance i needed im a dude from the hood so the chance he gave me is a chance i needed to never turn back im good my artistry my talent my career was never built on controversy so i would never come out and say a whole bunch of things that could be said all i can say is im sorry he cant be here to be a part of whats about to happen because were about to tear em up
5721769 street kids united by loyalty and loot goons and n as getting it
5721770 i got a chance to learn a lot and be around cam and jim and watch us the diplomats one of the greatest movements and still one of the greatest movements doing this thing today i know the ins and outs of what it takes to build a powerful movement i know the things that got us to the points where we needed to be then i know some of the things that was holding us back i get to work around the things i need to work around jim has byrd gang i have the skull gang and freekey zekey has 730
5721771 its no hard feelings and now that im out of my situation i dont mind putting a diplomat album together
5721772 at first people kinda looked at us like damn whats going on
5721773 they looking at us like were disloyal but as the time went by its kinda like what we gonna do just die out because the dude that was supposed to be the boss and the head of the table decided to disappear that means we would have vanished along with that we from harlem baby we hustlers were gonna stay afloat were not even floating right now were surfing we not even surfing im the ocean

5721782 the coast guard is dragging its feet to stop the ongoing harm to the great lakes
5721783 how much longer will the great lakes have to wait to gain the environmental protections they deserve
5721784 just because the practice has been occurring for almost a century doesnt make it right
5721785 everyone needs to do their part every change made to improve the health of the great lakes will help turn the tide towards a restored ecosystem
5721786 for great lakes restoration to succeed we cant use the lakes as a dumping ground
5721787 the coast guard should require ships to dispose of their cargo waste properly in accordance with existing laws
5721788 the coast guard proposed the two polarizing options to allow the practice with few limits or impose an immediate ban
5721789 if those are the only options we are given of course we side with protection of the great lakes
5721790 as the coast guard acknowledges some control practices are already being implemented voluntarily while further studies could help inform the process we believe such practices could be expanded and an effective control program can and should be phased in now

5721873 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5721874 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
5721875 remember than night at auburn two years ago when gary rogers drove the cougars 90 yards in six plays for a touchdown
5721876 that could go down as the most mysterious choice ever made god forbid if hed stayed in and led us to a couple more scores and we had a full blown quarterback controversy
5721877 theres no question what we have to do is definitely put limits on him because he wants to be back and he wants to be going we have to be very careful because hes what i call an instinctive player his instincts take over and he just goes
5721878 ty is a fabulous guy and im fully supportive of him the fans need to be good husky fans they need to say im pulling for him imagine if he rips off a couple of wins early it could be a very special year but you support your people thats what you have to do
5721879 there wasnt anything martinez couldnt hit he had short arms so you couldnt jam him that much you try to jam him and he would shoot it to right field jam him again and hed pull it down the left field line he could do anything and that made him dangerous
5721880 you look at the numbers and our bullpen has collectively struggled but i dont associate those numbers with morrow not being here
5721881 he has to be a starting point guard on a team that can get to 46 48 50 wins and be consistent night in and night out
5721882 its a tough deal when you see they are up by 40 and shes playing 30 plus minutes its hard but they are on a mission and i am sure they are trying to make their decision based on trying to win a gold medal

5721916 we have 28 people awaiting nursing home placement and another 12 being assessed which means that theres 40 who could be moved if the beds were there
5721917 weve been able to open them for six weeks during the day 9am to 5 30pm at this stage with staff prepared to work overtime so its not a permanent solution
5721918 what we have been discussing in brussels in preparation to accra is that on part of the partner countries are not all that positively interested in division of labor because they fear maybe and that is my translation that this will decrease opportunities for them

5721920 having a flat year is not all in itself a bad thing when compared to building activity experienced in less stable building markets on the mainland and especially across the tasman in new zealand
5721921 to build over 2800 homes consistently and to have a renovations market sitting around 750 million of activity shows that broadly speaking the tasmanian industry has again been given a relatively stable prognosis
5721922 it is important that this trend is arrested in tasmania in light of stronger population growth and new lows in rental vacancies
5721923 failure to do so will see the state follow the larger states into a much deeper housing affordability crisis
5721924 we expect the recovery to be modest over 2009 10 and 2010 11 given the lack of skilled labour in the industry and the long road ahead in lifting housing affordability to reasonable levels
5721925 i have heard tasmanians say we are trusting you to clean up this mess
5721926 and that is what i am going to do step by step piece by piece
5721927 the timeframe is adequate for what will be a major and well overdue upgrade in tasmanias accountability framework processes and mechanisms
5721928 its not really an exact science like it is on a residential street
5721929 it was a shame that the final was on the same night as our production of cats at the princess theatre in launceston
5721930 its disappointing but we always knew that would be the case
5721931 of the seven people making up these two bands five are in our production of cats in lead and orchestral roles
5721932 its great to see we are doing so well in music and performance but a shame we cant go all the way
5721933 we came first and second in last years competition and this year as well which is quite rare
5721934 we really encourage our students to write and play their own music and both bands did it wonderfully
5721935 users need to be careful about overheating of the machines our ministry told apple to improve its technological development and probe the cause of the incidents so that similar incidents do not happen again

5721943 if as seems to be the case outbursts of torrential rain are to become a characteristic of northern irelands climate government departments and agencies should have plans in place to minimize both the chances of flooding and the disruption which follows floods
5721944 valencia is a grand prix ive been looking forward to as its not only a new circuit but a new street circuit
5721945 from what ive seen and read about it i think itll be a great track to race on so i cant wait for the weekend to start
5721946 the atmosphere will no doubt be fantastic as well because the spanish have a real passion for formula 1
5721947 valencia should be a track that suits our car so im hoping well have a good race and take something positive away from spain
5721948 the new track looks great and should be really interesting to race on as at monaco and montreal our car goes well at these kinds of tracks so im hoping well put in a good performance there
5721949 i would never blame individuals for the team not lifting a trophy
5721950 we are in it together we win as a team and we lose as a team
5721951 as individuals we all make mistakes and the message i was relaying to a czech newspaper was that we are more experienced now and have learnt from last season
5721952 we came so close last year to winning something and we will be giving it our all to win a trophy this year
5721953 i have previously advised liverpool over two danes with daniel agger and nicola savic both of whom they purchased and are almost too happy with
5721954 i gave them mathias jorgensens name a long time ago and liverpool are wild about him they are keeping very good track of him
5721955 liverpool see him as a very promising youngster like i do and clearly just like a player who will play for the danish national team for many years to come
5721956 i have not heard a dickie bird they have gone nowhere near him

5721962 i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5721963 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest
5721964 now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5721965 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5721966 weve got a good nucleus of a squad now but were a little thin in terms of numbers if we get injuries
5721967 with the money ive got to spend i could probably bring in ten players but they wouldnt be the right ones
5721968 i scored the first goal of my season during this trip to twente for sure its intense pleasure but the most important thing was first of all winning this game
5721969 we expected a tough game and suffered during the first half because they put us under pressure

5721979 without 8 gbit storage systems shipping except for emc clariion cx4 8 gbit is about host aggregation that makes blade servers one of the sweet spots for 8 gbit its not always about bandwidth its also about latency and the number of i os and aggregation
5721980 even with only three or four virtual servers on physical machines the i o requirement really gets driven up
5721981 although blade switches generate less money compared to directors or standalone switches for brocade the growth rate of blade switches is probably highest
5721982 and hp is no 1 in blades so this is important for brocade

5721988 despite an increasingly difficult enterprise spending environment in the u s and parts of europe reasonable growth expectations strength in emerging countries currency and product cycles should be enough to drive some upside for each company
5721989 theyre very high growth economies but theyre still subject to volatility
5721990 i think chinas just kind of a who knows its so hot it has to come down eventually
5721991 even if china goes from 25 percent to 15 percent year over year growth it can cause some volatility
5721992 youre going to hear notebooks doing well for both companies
5721993 i think that hp continues to be very upbeat about what it can do with eds and will go to great lengths on the conference call to convince people of that
5721994 share gains on the inkjet side combined with stronger emerging market growth on the laser side should drive another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth in printers and operating margin above 15 percent
5721995 even against a tough comparison we expect hp to maintain double digit pc revenue growth on strength outside of the u s
5721996 if it does continue to strengthen you could see some of that be a headwind to top line growth
5721997 the u s is obviously still a very important region for these companies
5721998 people know its weak but does it get worse i would argue even the u s business has not been as bad as people have said
5721999 it is not simple to implement a take back scheme because the culture of returning hardware does not exist in india
5722000 in india used hardware is still perceived as a value rather than cost
5722001 we havent seen anything like this before where a company scores 10 points over its nearest rival
5722002 there was a question mark last year about apple that maybe it had taken its eye off the ball by concentrating on the iphone but now the iphone and ipod and mac are nicely aligned
5722003 most of apples windows based competition is suffering a bit from vista
5722004 complaints about vista are generating complaints about the computer makers
5722005 people know there have been some service and product quality problems but apple has an almost teflon like quality its problems dont really seem to matter to consumers
5722006 most lose it slowly like dell has which took a while and we see companies improve but apples extreme volatility is almost like its stock price
5722007 apple will be very difficult to catch but i dont think that these results where theres a 10 point difference will hold
5722008 my guess is that they will regroup at some point and come back

5722015 this was the right ending to conclude the olympic games
5722016 weve made a conscious effort to move the concept of the condom away from negative association like hiv and sex work
5722017 condoms are actually health products and if you have a condom and you use it you are seen to be smart and responsible
5722018 its a way to show you are a condom user and you dont have any issues with it
5722019 one explanation might be that theres a group of consumers thats holding off making do with the devices that they have either because of larger economic concerns or because they dont see any value yet in the new voice and data services that are driving some of these new handsets
5722020 im starting to suspect that the evan bayh boomlet is designed to make tim kaine look better by comparison because really evan bayh is about the only democrat who makes tim kaine look palatable by comparison as obamas veep
5722021 of the people i dont really want to be veep who keep showing up on those fake short lists people keep coming up with he bothers me the least
5722022 personally i still think those significant negatives would make her a terrible pick unfortunately im resigned to obama making a terrible pick with someone else anyway biden bayh kaine so if its between one of those three terrible picks or clinton i throw my hands up in the air

5722030 we know about glitter because of his fame but there are many other sex offenders not in the public eye who are falling off the radar

5722032 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5722033 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour
5722034 unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
5722035 hey its mid august lets beat the traffic and save on supplies and get as far away as possible
5722036 two story 8 000 square foot headquarters for hundreds of bloggers
5722037 it showed at the same time that he highly respects the opinions of both scientists and theologians and that it isnt his job to play god

5722040 to go through what i went through and be back on top again im just so blessed right now
5722041 they had guys in 68 that didnt make the team that could whip this team im not taking anything away from these young athletes but i dont think they have anywhere near the depth we had
5722042 i had a lot of people in my corner encouraging me and looking after me
5722043 they have gone down so well and we are pleased with the format its aimed at all different levels of cruise and is great for networking
5722044 i understand that unfortunately the internet seems to be a haven for people who like to just get out there and throw out the most vitriolic and aggressive stance they can but there are no secret piles of money that the companys somehow magically making
5722045 i havent been paid in almost two months and ive been putting money out to try and get people taken care of thats the flip side
5722046 it probably goes against popular belief but just because we all used to work at blizzard doesnt mean that were all millionaires although that sure would have been great
5722047 as anybody could tell you during the last days of flagship i was pretty much a wreck
5722048 hellgate came out and it wasnt as good as it should have been theres a myriad of reasons for that some of them were just bad timing in the pc market the pc market was lousy last year
5722049 some of it was the fact that we were an independent studio we didnt have unlimited money and we had to ship when we had to ship part of it was because we overreached and that was a design problem that was totally our fault we tried to do too much
5722050 we tried to be a standalone game and a free play game and an mmo and an rpg and a shooter we were trying to be something for everybody and ended up really not pleasing many people at all i think we should have picked one or the other
5722051 the challenge they face is like if somebody says hey i made you a loan against your ferrari and now the loans due so i want the ferrari and i say great heres a box of parts because i didnt actually finish building the car yet
5722052 so they have it but its not done and they dont have any of the engineers that were there that know how to build the game or use the tools or use the tech or anything

5722059 i feel i would like to continue and that i still have a fair bit of footy left in me so that will be discussed over the next month but yeah id love to continue on next year he said
5722060 in some respects theres not as much pressure on us because our past record against collingwood has been pretty ordinary he said
5722061 it is going to be a pretty big challenge for the group
5722062 we have been questioned about our performances in the past month and the way we perform in the next two weeks will determine where we finish in terms of our finals campaign
5722063 lunatic the two footy stars were unaware danyan had just been released from jail and was a hardened cage fighter
5722064 greg went for a few beers when some bloke belted nick youngquest he king hit him in the jaw cronulla chief executive tony zappia said
5722065 birdy then went in and he got whacked too birdy then wrestled the bloke to the ground before security intervened and escorted the bloke out of the premises
5722066 all greg was doing was protecting nick youngquest this happened at 6pm and birdy was home by 8 30pm
5722067 it wasnt late at night and he wasnt intoxicated he didnt leave our fan day until 3 30pm and this happened at 6pm greg was very open and honest with the club he came straight to myself and ricky stuart sharks coach and told us what happened
5722068 greg is old school he went straight in to help his mate the bloke really cleaned up youngquest he was a bit mad
5722069 i cant find out a reason as to why it happened but the players youngquest and holdsworth claimed it wasnt their fault
5722070 bird came in over the top he did the right thing the lunatic was then kicked out nick and bird went outside and got a taxi home they just wanted to get away it is a reminder that players need to be very careful about where they go for a drink and the type of people they mix with
5722071 targeting the first test when asked if it was the wallabies must win leg on tour
5722072 if i had a rand for every time i was asked that question
5722073 the reality is you can only live in the moment you can only deal with the challenges you are presented with at any given time we have an opportunity coming this weekend and we are not thinking beyond this outing
5722074 can anyone really be educated when they are not permitted to think about certain subjects did you work so hard for all those years just so you could spend your professional life cowering from threats leveled by those with no passion for the truth
5722075 id always juggled a ball since i was young but it was about three years ago that i started football freestyle doing tricks its an online competition where you place videos on youtube he said
5722076 when i went to the first audition they wanted someone who could remove their clothes except underpants while juggling the ball i didnt think i had much chance i was called back and there were even more people being tested
5722077 this time they asked for a special trick i caught it in my undies first go what else i did was my own idea i was hoping i might get a side part initially i was surprised when i got the main role
5722078 when i have a long session like that ill take the next day off he said
5722079 its something i might be able to teach people when i finish school ive certainly been giving it a lot of thought
5722080 i am not a noted goalscorer but ive been involved in a lot of assists i enjoy that he said
5722081 not at liberty to respond to the claims on behalf of his stewards
5722082 because the matter is currently before the court its inappropriate that the authority makes any comment or that any person involved makes any comment
5722083 theres a matter before the industrial relations commission and the facts and circumstances of that case are yet to be determined by the commission and no one is to make any comment about that
5722084 the authority has received legal advice that it would be inappropriate a spokesperson said
5722085 we dont make any money everything we earn goes back into the community
5722086 hes always full of advice not only with goalkeeping but in life in general vukovic said
5722087 still black still proud the african tribute to james brown
5722088 i went over and tried to talk to him just about doing some under the table money
5722089 23 members theres no way the lord god can ignore us now
5722090 good me theres been an infinitesimal spike in cheaper petrol prayers from the washington dc area time for me to rethink my moral stance on us petrol prices i am nothing if not a democratic god after all but first to ignore the plight of the starving
5722091 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5722092 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5722093 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5722094 theres a lot of anger circulating among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger
5722095 i said beauty disadvantaged now beauty is in the eye of the beholder
5722096 we carried out an analysis of what pete doherty and his band does
5722097 what he does as part of his routine is to gee up the crowd they speed up and then slow down the music and create a whirlpool effect in the crowd
5722098 they the crowd all get geed up and then they start fighting
5722099 the international community has pushed an agenda that has resulted in loss of life and destruction of property
5722100 unfair and insulting to the international community and african leaders who have come forward to help kenya
5722101 i couldnt let them hide behind the mediators any longer
5722102 all that was missing was the village tree this was an african solution to an african problem
5722103 if wed had 5 000 dead the entrenchment of displacement would have reached a point where you could never walk it back and that would have laid the groundwork for genocide later on
5722104 co ordination was particularly intense with us secretary of state condoleezza rice
5722105 i would give the statements to annan and he would approve them before they went out
5722106 became emphatic in backing the power sharing accord annan envisaged
5722107 there is a class issue and a kind of racism in the world i am a kenyan minister and nobody listens to me the election was not rigged the whole world fell for propaganda why should washington run the world
5722108 there was also evidence that some post electoral violence was co ordinated by odm agitators neither side was clean
5722109 was that we cant let this happen to kenya wed seen a lot of destruction in the region rwanda somalia sudan darfur and kenya had been the safe haven for refugees and suddenly kenya itself was going
5722110 if you have a problem with the government not putting in place policy and regulatory frameworks in place that is another issue and the ministers are here to deal with it but you should not tell us to stop going east african
5722111 we should not discuss protectionism or equality but unity issues of equality are what sank the first east african community because other countries thought that kenya was gaining more
5722112 you should know that some people in government are not doing their work and the private sector is suffering as a result you are basically mortgaging the private sector in this country
5722113 we have been lobbying the government to establish a ugandan reinsurance company for seven years now but in vain the 10 years we ask for are modest
5722114 we cannot guarantee that if we give you that time you will have developed capacity by then on the contrary i think when we open up we shall gain in construction for instance we have a backlog of 80 000 housing units so restricting that sector would make the situation worse
5722115 in uganda the land belongs to the people while in the other countries it belongs to the state so unless this is harmonised we could have a problem according to ugandan law it is not possible for a non national to acquire freehold land we only give leases up to 99 years
5722116 but this is still only a reduction whereas under the customs union these barriers are supposed to be completely eliminated
5722117 we shall advise the nairobi meeting that since there is a negotiated protocol on the customs union that is slated to be reviewed by 2010 any issues in the context of that protocols implementation should be left out of the common market protocol
5722118 our position is that we cant recommend the players tour pakistan for the champions trophy marsh said
5722119 obviously we put a position forward a few weeks ago to the icc to that effect but we said we would keep an open mind with the taskforce which we did
5722120 we heard them speak on friday now we have had a chance to digest it all our position hasnt changed
5722121 we have concerns with every aspect of this tournament at the moment marsh said
5722122 well that might be hard for you being that youre black and people arent used to seeing blacks in these parts
5722123 thanks for reminding me that im black for maybe drawing attention to all those awkward exchanges in stores or in restaurants the extra looks i receive all the things i ignored just to make the trip more comfortable thanks for highlighting that i can never fit in or fully comfortable in your country

5722127 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5722128 we are aware of his passport number and will happily assist mr gadd to the intended destination in case he has second thoughts about stopping off here
5722129 he is ok but he is worried about his health he has problems with his hearing and his heart

5722140 we have made an early decision given the rain that has fallen in the last hour to abandon wednesdays card
5722141 the met office have also issued a severe weather warning for the yorkshire area for the next few hours and we deeply regret abandoning on wednesday
5722142 there are only really 18 blokes in contention provided everyone is fit and healthy
5722143 if we lose some players then im confident about the blokes that we can bring in
5722144 but i dont think its too hard to pick the top 18
5722145 hes improving hell play again this weekend against huddersfield and im sure hell improve again
5722146 but he didnt get as many minutes as i would have liked against harlequins last weekend and i always thought he would be more prominent for the play offs
5722147 longy will play against huddersfield but maurie is a doubt for the cup final
5722148 he has had a couple of setbacks with his hamstring and he wont play this weekend so he is a big doubt for wembley
5722149 but scully should also play this week so im getting some players back who havent played much recently and well have a very strong side out there at huddersfield on sunday
5722150 hull are getting pole axed week after week so they have obviously got their eyes focused on the cup
5722151 its plain for everyone to see that thats their focus whereas weve been winning games
5722152 with any new manager it takes time but i feel we have the nucleus of a very good squad
5722153 we have worked on things in training trying to get a shape in the way we play
5722154 it does take time and there arent many games to prepare so this is an important game because we are going to be judged on the world cup qualifiers
5722155 unfortunately scotland havent qualified for 10 years so ive told the players to make a bit of history and take their country to the world cup finals
5722156 its not going to be easy but they are certainly going give it their best shot
5722157 ideally we would like a fully fit squad with the likes of barry ferguson alan hutton gary caldwell and paul hartley
5722158 sometimes that doesnt happen and that means you need a good squad its not all about 11 players its about having a squad together
5722159 there are some big characters in the squad and there is a bit of belief
5722160 after the last campaign there is a belief that we can compete against the best but its not going to be easy
5722161 our challenge is taking the country to the final stages of a major championship which we havent done for a long time
5722162 but there is certainly no fear we have a good blend of youth and experience and a lot of players playing at the top level every week and hopefully they can take that into international level
5722163 you have to move on and you have to develop and thats no disrespect to the players who are over 35
5722164 maybe they can do a job now but in the future they will be older the average age of the squad i picked was 25 so its a young squad and we are developing for the future
5722165 but now is more important and thats why the likes of david weir coming in the squad is so important for us
5722166 that experience for the big games coming up is massive for us
5722167 i spoke to david before announcing the squad and gary would have played on wednesday had he been fit
5722168 but i said to david that he was certainly in my plans for the world cup we know what he can do the world cup is not for experiments so david is certainly in my thoughts
5722169 hes 38 but hes still as fit as a fiddle and hes still playing regularly for rangers
5722170 he comes into the equation but he has never been out of the equation
5722171 i just didnt think it was right bringing him into the squad and not playing him and having him sitting on the bench
5722172 but once i knew gary wasnt going to be fit i had no problem with bringing david in
5722173 i was very pleased with our performance in our last friendly at hampden against croatia
5722174 i thought we performed very well and it was a good draw against one of the top teams in europe
5722175 hopefully we can put on a good performance and get a win
5722176 wal mart has staked out the position with its save money live better tagline that they are the king of low prices
5722177 well save you money and well help your family make it through these economic times
5722178 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5722179 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5722180 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich i dont believe in class warfare or redistribution of the wealth
5722181 can you believe that turkey is beating us in spam
5722182 probably every three hours we have somebody looking at it storm map and let us know

5722257 by doing this we hope to lure people out of their trenches to come dance with us
5722258 i dont like misha but no way russia is going to dictate who my president is
5722259 the mystery behind paris hiltons big boobs has been solved and no it doesnt involve plastic surgery
5722260 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5722261 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5722262 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5722263 weve secured all the buildings and the canteen is stocked for three days
5722264 i think people have learned a lesson and everyone is preparing for the storm
5722265 people are remembering previous storms that have come through florida and it brings back bad memories
5722266 but it also reminds us of the seriousness of it all that we need to take precautions
5722267 what is the matter with a little bit of leaven
5722268 tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine
5722269 youre going to attract more flies with honey than vinegar
5722270 by adding the same 6 2 9 1 clause it keeps blockers from hitting jammers into the inner circle on purpose which could end up causing that jammer to hit a benched player or referee and cause injuries
5722271 if two teams start practicing maneuvers that force jammers into the inner track and into the penalty box there could be a lot of start amp stops with both jammers in the penalty box
5722272 so far its going good we have power and everything its just been windy and rainy
5722273 i think were going to all enjoy a nice summer day
5722274 i shall not be moved 7 his mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression
5722275 with our tongue we will prevail our lips are our own who is lord over us
5722276 for the oppression of the poor for the sighing of the needy now i will arise
5722277 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
5722278 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5722279 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5722280 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5722281 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5722282 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5722283 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5722284 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5722285 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5722286 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5722287 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5722288 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5722289 i love it this is amazing thank you so much god i love it
5722290 gina god has changed my life forever when i got saved and he hasnt stopped taking care of me since then
5722291 no more god i just want you show me the way
5722292 the public has no idea whether those studies have been submitted to the epa or not and if so what they show maybe they never came in maybe they came in and they show a real problem for bees maybe theyre poorly conducted studies that dont satisfy epas requirement
5722293 weve been monitoring the bee die off situation for a couple of years and its a complex puzzle that may also involve mites viruses and other factors
5722294 we want this information now we cannot continue to wait bees are disappearing our whole existence depends on them because we eat the flowers need to be pollinated and the only ones to do it are the bees
5722295 the sports hernia where i go online to get my laughs

5722301 make a list of what you were grateful for in bill gwatneys life
5722302 he was a better golfer than i was i am not grateful for that but he seemed to genuinely like it if i hit a good shot which is a sign of grace
5722303 i am more grateful than i can say for the support he gave to hillary in this long last year
5722304 we have to understand we can only keep him alive if the love we felt for him and the love he felt for us is somehow manifest in our lives
5722305 he could have taken a lot of other roads but he chose public service
5722306 i am not worried you have to give them time he is 19 years old
5722307 theo is not yet completely there collectively but he can make decisions in big games that will always be his strength
5722308 he is a boy who will always make progress because he is intelligent and he knows where he wants to get and that is why i believe you have to patient with him
5722309 i believe that when everyone is sharp we will have much more invention
5722310 but of course you always want a player like fabregas to be in there because he gives you the quality of the pass
5722311 i am not worried you have to give them time he is 19 years old
5722312 theo is not yet completely there collectively but he can make decisions in big games that will always be his strength
5722313 he is a boy who will always make progress because he is intelligent and he knows where he wants to get and that is why i believe you have to patient with him
5722314 i believe that when everyone is sharp we will have much more invention
5722315 but of course you always want a player like fabregas to be in there because he gives you the quality of the pass
5722316 i am not worried you have to give them time he is 19 years old
5722317 theo is not yet completely there collectively but he can make decisions in big games that will always be his strength

5722319 i believe that when everyone is sharp we will have much more invention
5722320 but of course you always want a player like fabregas to be in there because he gives you the quality of the pass
5722321 i would never blame individuals for the team not lifting a trophy we are in it together we win as a team and we lose as a team
5722322 as individuals we all make mistakes and the message i was relaying to a czech newspaper was that we are more experienced now and have learnt from last season
5722323 we came so close last year to winning something and we will be giving it our all to win a trophy this year
5722324 the rough guide to world music african amp middle east
5722325 when we created the plan for the magazine we wanted to cover every aspect of the music we have legends that no one knows anything about we have producers that no one knows about if you dont tell the story no one knows
5722326 through the magazine were able to be exposed to new upcoming artists
5722327 they gave me a case when it was released two weeks ago and its pretty much done
5722328 osvaldo knew so much about the old cape verdean musicians
5722329 i said oh this is part of the puzzle that was missing
5722330 i think people like to have the actual paper magazine
5722331 outside the us a lot of people like that tactile thing to hold what you read
5722332 i realized theyre the main force in the cape verde community in the us
5722333 i hate to say this after losing three games straight but when we are in sync and all nine guys are playing well i think we can be as strong as bolton
5722334 we have too many guys who hang their heads when they get behind in the pitching count instead of showing they are interested they pull back and shake their heads and give that sad little walk around the plate
5722335 that shouldnt happen at this level of baseball either you are going to play it as a man or maybe you shouldnt play it baseball
5722336 overall i think the team was a lot better this season than it was in 2007 the record shows that as for the playoffs what killed us was one bad inning in every game
5722337 we have four or five guys who are potentially really good pitchers they still have trouble finding the strike zone and thats something that hurt us in our last game with bolton
5722338 we have the potential but we have a couple of guys on this team who think they should be swinging hard all the time baseball isnt a game for swinging hard unless you are a very consistent home run hitter
5722339 but i will definitely not put up with the long faces i put up with this year we were l1 5 this year and we werent 11 5 because we were lucky
5722340 the signature mani pedi while a little on the pricey side at 60 is really a little slice of relaxation heaven

5722351 the perception for the rank and file republicans is that people are picking and choosing candidates and the grass roots network will eventually erode because they feel they dont have a part in it
5722352 because she has rallied support from some conservatives based on her tough position on illegal immigration in recent weeks she has corralled support from activists focused on reducing illegal immigration including the team america political action committee founded by colorado rep tom tancredo
5722353 because now that 22 83 was really easy everybody else had to run harder because they didnt get that feeling the first round
5722354 now its rest and still fine tune for the final i really held my form better than i have any other time
5722355 my dad was like oh they should have re started it

5722364 right about now im just trying to adjust to it

5722491 eli moet je horen rabbi jezus is in de stad je weet wel die rabbi die zoveel wonderen doet kom we brengen je erheen en dan leggen we je voor de rabbi neer
5722492 joh hoe moet ik daar komen ik kan niet eens mijn benen bewegen ik kan niets dan kan ik zeker niet de hele stad door

5722520 meshwerks had nothing to do with designing the appearance of toyotas vehicles distinguishing them from any other cars trucks or vans in the world that expressive creation took place before meshwerks happened along and was the result of work done by toyota and its designers indeed at least six of the eight vehicles at issue are still covered by design patents belonging to toyota and protecting the appearances of the objects for which they are issued
5722521 a putative creator who merely shifts the medium in which anothers creation is expressed has not necessarily added anything beyond the expression contained in the original

5722525 this case may disturb and trouble you so much you want to search for a reason why
5722526 this is not a case of a baby screaming and crying and driving me nuts
5722527 this is a child put down on the bed going to sleep in the most innocent situation you can possible imagine
5722528 this is something much more malevolent he let his mounting anger and resentment out on that little girl that night
5722529 and here youve got an attack 18 individual blows and it went on relentlessly
5722530 he used his elbow he wanted to hurt her more
5722531 he used his knee he wanted to hurt her more
5722532 shes in distress shes having difficulty breathing and he picks her up and swings her about

5722535 although many queenslanders dream of moving up the coast in reality the best quality of life in queensland is found in regional areas particularly the darling downs
5722536 we will work closely with queensland health and workplace health and safety queensland to identify any factors that led to this event
5722537 the welfare of our staff member is our main concern
5722538 rates went too far and the reserve is now trying to reverse them
5722539 they are now becoming more concerned that we might have a recession
5722540 less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5722541 we think there could be three cuts in a row
5722542 household net worth had declined by almost 5 per cent over the first half of 2008

5722550 we assume that a parent after expiration of paid leave in the form of a grant would be able to incur a debt with the commonwealth which provides funds as a partial income replacement for up to six months for each child
5722551 the amount borrowed for one child is assumed to be approximately 14 000 which is the hourly national minimum wage received full time for six months this is doubled for two children
5722552 a cap could be imposed per household to limit the possibility of a large debt on the scheme and the government would determine the size of the cap
5722553 instead of paying employees who take leave employers could receive a subsidy or tax concession

5722567 he preyed on vulnerable young people and turned them into recruits to his cause using internet chat rooms to lure them in then incite them to fight

5722569 if you take this into account the transport emissions are even smaller less than one tenth of the overall amount of co2 saved by recycling
5722570 the growth in exports is in part a success story reflecting the rapid development of the uks collection infrastructure and increase in recovery rates exports to china are bridging the gap between plastic bottle collections being established and the future development of domestic reprocessing capacity
5722571 it may seem strange that transporting our unwanted paper and plastic bottles such a distance would actually be better for the environment but that is what the evidence from this study shows
5722572 we do not have a manufacturing base here ideally it would be dealt with here but we would far prefer to see it recycled in china where it is a resource than landfilled in britain
5722573 nicecast and dj 1800 could have been made for each other

5722580 what youre want your specific brand and you didnt bring them

5722582 since holbox is remote and a cash only location without a bank or atm they dont take plastic or travelers checks so make sure youve got 600 cash when we head that away
5722583 see they cant even get along with each other why should we be nice to them
5722584 no part of me watched 90210 and thought yeah thats what my life is like it seemed like a different planet i mean i like shitty movies as much as the next guy im not a snob but things like that had no guys like us in it that was the point
5722585 its like if you took that blue oyster shit i gave you last week and then that crazy afghan kush i had that one time and they had a baby and then meanwhile that crazy northern lights shit i had and that red espresso snowflake shit i had made a baby and by some crazy miracle those two babies met and fucked this would be it
5722586 im fine dont worry i dont plan to die after making a promise to you
5722587 not even a full day has passed since you let go of the past and you are already becoming that friendly with miss ashley master ben
5722588 she was only helping me with my bandages that came loose when keith just attacked
5722589 that psycho appeared again so soon last time that jerk did something it took months before he showed his face again what did the lunatic want this time a sparring match fashion advice for you a good butt whooping
5722590 a sparring match and butt whooping are close to the same thing reaper serious face he came originally to try to get me to join him and the magos but when he saw ashley he went berserk and attacked her i was able to drive him off this time
5722591 this is so interesting that even hellia might be amused at this fact
5722592 oh sorry i was only thinking of safety and happiness
5722593 that one has lungs owi my ears are still ringing
5722594 she is really a pain how can that guy risk his life to save her let alone do so much as to defend her against that manic mago and our kunai attacks and why does she care so much about him that she would rush to his side just to see to his bandages
5722595 good questions but i only know what you said because i read your lips my twin
5722596 having those two without their hearing will be a pain in my old ass fane dira
5722597 we can hear that woman is loud that old fart is cool the boy is weak the mage is a perv the cub is powerful the weapons are unique and weird my twin we hit the jackpot of bizarre things
5722598 the only woman is nee san the old fart would be master law the boy is me the cub is brother so that means the mage is artemis
5722599 that means that he is a womanizer and likes to flirt with all kinds of women as long as they are cute or beautiful in his eyes im sort of surprised you arent mad about being called weak
5722600 compared to everyone else here besides the singing tree people i am weak brother is close to master rank you are a master and artemis is more experienced in magic then i am and because im younger then nee san i am weaker then her for now
5722601 the boy is smarter then he looks because he is wise beyond his years and twice as mature allow us to introduce ourselves we are sara and hima we call ourselves gemini ninja please to make your acquaintance please be friendly towards us kunoichi we are both the same age as the boy
5722602 we are sorry for our kunai strike we wanted to see if you were powerful we saw you fight that manic mago with just ki quite a stupid and dangerous stunt but you drove him away for the time being both look over at trent both rush over to him you are very cute how would you like to marry us
5722603 thats sad he probably never thought that he would lose his fiancee
5722604 dont beat yourself up about this miss ashley ben is slowly opening up to you after all while im here i can see his memories in real time like he can i saw and heard that he promised to protect you he did the same thing with maria when they were younger
5722605 so this boy made a promise but couldnt keep it in the end do you really think he will carry out his promise this time reaper
5722606 now this heart will represent bens heart for the longest time maria was the only one with a key to take the chains off when he would fight with master ang or wild animals he would seal his heart so he can focus on fighting but when he saw maria
5722607 so he took it out of the box when he said he would protect me
5722608 but he is hirotos son hiroto was the captain of the guard in akamaru village in fact bens ancestor kisuke the founder of shinki was the first captain of the guard ben was to be the next captain it was tradition that first born son of bens family would take over as captain of the guard
5722609 so what were you dreaming about you had a smile on your face and then it disappeared
5722610 it was my dream for the future maria and i with our children but everytime i have that dream i am reminded of the failure that cost me my fiancees life as well as my first borns life
5722611 they only saw the beginning of it where you are about to go to the river with maria and your children and your son doing the same thing you did when you were younger fighting off animals
5722612 it doesnt matter that dream is recurring and always the same scenario
5722613 dont worry they arent deep a little ointment and a few bandages and ill be good looks around where did my shirt go to
5722614 i put it at the edge of the bed so its underneath it now why are you worried about it
5722615 i was just thinking that it would be kind of mean to tear up a gift this soon
5722616 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5722617 i think there is little question that the domestic auto makers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5722618 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5722619 were seeing very good improvement in the past few years with lincoln and mercury in a number of surveys
5722620 were working very hard and were getting good results to improve customer satisfaction
5722621 were making the necessary changes to ensure customer satisfaction for our chrysler jeep and dodge brands
5722622 we think that soon well see the same success in external metrics that were already seeing in internal metrics
5722623 the military provides the tests proctors and grading without charge in exchange the scores are sent to military branch recruiters and the school

5722635 for the most part when the united states has set out on its own and absent direct provocation to overthrow a government and to think that having installed a new one it could tinker with the effects and bring about a happy outcome disaster has been the result to be sure the frequently cited counterexamples of grenada and panama may to varying degrees be conceded but again unilateral american intervention has done considerably more harm than good over the past decades it is worth revisiting this sorry lineage for a moment not because it tells the whole story of american foreign policy it does not but because it underscores some of the profound risks of reckless intervention
5722636 capitalism is seen as arrogant but that is merely the rage of caliban on seeing his reflection the extraordinary thing about capitalism is its humility and refusal to judge it will give us what we want it will not force on us what it thinks we need often we are disgusted by what we discover that we want but that reflects on us not on the servant who brings us our fetish gear and saturated fats it would bring us organic turnips just as happily if we cease to desire a product the product changes or ceases to exist there is nothing more powerless than a corporation

5722642 consumer non cyclical stocks have rallied nicely over the past few weeks driven by a combination of better than expected eps results moderating commodity costs and investor realization that we might not be headed for a discretionary back half recovery
5722643 the company has sponsored various software applications to support this initiative and the reps that we spoke to seemed to be supportive of using e tools to improve their businesses

5722646 the most disappointing feature of the god delusion is dawkinss failure to engage religious thought in any serious way
5722647 for 10 of the last 11 weeks weve sustained less than 200 attacks per week nationwide
5722648 were making progress in each of these areas every day
5722649 and while these efforts are progressing at a different pace they all are moving forward in a positive and tangible manner
5722650 in the north al qaida is in disarray and its capability to conduct well planned and coordinated attacks is limited but they still pose a real threat to the population
5722651 and a couple of weeks ago i walked through an open market in mosul that was several kilometers long and it was overflowing with iraqis
5722652 now thats something that would not have been possible just a couple of months ago and this is a clear sign that we are making progress
5722653 as a result of the improved security in places like basra and amarah were seeing fewer numbers of lethal accelerants making their way into baghdad
5722654 today these militias are largely disrupted and ineffective because of iraqi operations and because the people have turned against them

5722660 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
5722661 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
5722662 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
5722663 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
5722664 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
5722665 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
5722666 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
5722667 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
5722668 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
5722669 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
5722670 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
5722671 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
5722672 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
5722673 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
5722674 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
5722675 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
5722676 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
5722677 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
5722678 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
5722679 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
5722680 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
5722681 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
5722682 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
5722683 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

5722701 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
5722702 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

5722704 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul

5722706 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
5722707 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
5722708 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
5722709 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
5722710 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
5722711 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
5722712 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
5722713 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
5722714 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
5722715 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
5722716 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
5722717 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
5722718 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
5722719 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
5722720 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
5722721 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
5722722 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
5722723 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother

5722750 contraception is not abortion the bush administrations proposal to change the definition of abortion and reduce womens access to birth control must be stopped
5722751 in a time when more and more families are uninsured and feeling the financial strain of a bad economy its pretty incredible that the bush administration is actually trying to put up roadblocks for women trying to access basic health care
5722752 and will be fighting to preserve womens access to health care information

5722754 family planning providers work to provide family planning services so its really not acceptable to the people i represent that this administration is considering allowing doctors and nurses and pharmacists that have received their education to provide services to now be able to not provide those services if they dont want to
5722755 whos going to provide access to contraceptives services if the administration provides this large loophole to deny services
5722756 providers are given an oath now they get to pick and choose what they want to do if a regulation is issued she said

5722760 our most difficult struggle is that we know what we need to solve our problems we just lack the capacity to make it happen
5722761 speak out and defend the rights of the poor and needy
5722762 we find that this final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities establishments with above average costs and even establishments with average costs could be hard pressed to continue to operate some of these may decide it is too costly and either change product lines or go out of business 140 very small less than 20 employees and 32 small dietary supplement manufacturers less than 500 employees will be at risk of going out of business costs per establishment are proportionally higher for very small than for large establishments the regulatory costs of this final rule will also discourage new small businesses from entering the industry
5722763 we expect that the majority of these costs will be borne by consumers of dietary supplements who will likely respond to the increase in prices by reducing consumption

5722766 in the days when cops only had guns and shooting people would kill them they were a lot more careful about using weapons
5722767 now that they have less than lethal weaponry there is nothing to stop them from shooting at people in fact because these weapons are supposedly less than lethal law enforcement is actually encouraged to start shooting at people these weapons are extremely lethal and the cops need to understand that
5722768 these videos show the feds werent sufficiently trained to deal with the stress of dealing with large crowds of people they got easily upset in situations where they shouldnt have i hope the dnc security force has a lot better training like the rainbows the dnc protesters are just people exercising their first amendment rights and there is no reason to start shooting at them
5722769 its clear they went in there to inflict pain and hurt people there was no one posing any threat whatsoever the feds were just looking to incite a response from the crowd
5722770 i dont think it would have been dads funeral without there being a slight edge
5722771 there was a love and compassion and feeling for the person who got a hard hand in life that oozed through the gravely voice of ronnie drew
5722772 he elevated the words of the song so it became a sacred mantra

5722796 sadly there is nothing new in this announcement today we have heard it all before
5722797 i think what people want to hear from the minister is what is she going to do about the housing crisis that is affecting thousands of people right across the north
5722798 the ministers approach to shared housing while deeply well meaning totally ignores the real housing issues facing us
5722799 mortgage repossessions have increased by almost 60 the levels of homelessness are at all time record highs there are not enough social houses being built the shared equity scheme has collapsed and there are major problems with the non regulation of the private rented sector
5722800 on all of these issues we have heard fine words from the minister but what people are still waiting for is a plan of action to actually tackle the scale of the problem
5722801 while i welcome the significant seizure of heroin in west dublin last night i also want to express concern at the recent spike in the number of heroin seizures
5722802 this view is backed up by the fact that the amount of heroin addicts seeking treatment has doubled to almost 10 000 in the last ten years
5722803 it is imperative that the garda continue target heroin dealers in the fight against drugs
5722804 due to the adverse weather conditions recently thousands of crop farmers are facing tough times as entire harvests have been wiped out
5722805 i know of one small farmer in my own constituency who has lost much of his harvest having put down his fertiliser when expecting good weather only for it all to be wash away in the rain at a huge cost
5722806 this flooding will cause genuine hardship for farmers who have lost crops or livestock and affect key farm projects such as the need to finish building slurry tanks by the end of year deadline
5722807 i have been inundated with calls from the farming community
5722808 i know that many farmers are looking at the wet weather scheme that was previously in place and also highlighting the long delays associated with it
5722809 i also know that there are very tight eu guidelines about state intervention but while the executive has re activated the flooding compensation scheme that will make up to 1000 available to householders i believe that the executive must also look at the situation facing farmers
5722810 i also know that many businesses have been affected by the flooding and they too need to be looked at
5722811 forty years ago coalisland was at birth of the civil rights movement it is fitting that we will commemorate the original march in the town
5722812 in 1968 there was a huge optimism that here ireland we could challenge the corrupt unionist state and bring about real change it was a belief that the world was changing that echoed not just around ireland but across the world
5722813 sadly the civil rights movement and its basic demands for housing jobs and democracy were met with all the violence of the unionist state
5722814 we now have an opportunity to build a future based on equality and mutual respect
5722815 in 1968 unionism failed to rise to the demands for change and we have a situation today that again challenges unionism
5722816 unionists know that if they want an assembly and executive taking meaningful decisions then they need to share power with republicans in a partnership government of equals
5722817 i am encouraging farmers to apply to the focus farm scheme so that they can share best practice with their neighbours and the wider farming community
5722818 visiting farmers can also benefit from direct mentoring by the focus farmers and explore ideas arising from the farm visit i am encouraging all farmers to make full use of focus farms to further help improve their own farm businesses

5722849 a large fraction of americans know that we need a jeffersonian political revolution to fix our corrupt system they were not fooled by the obama rhetoric about change not from someone that has been a product of and servant for the two party plutocracy yes all the votes for me and the other third party presidential candidates spelled the difference between obama winning and losing our voters correctly protested against the corrupt two party system they did not elect mccain only those who voted for mccain elected him and that is something they must live with as they watch a mccain administration continue dismantling american democracy and budget busting global warmongering
5722850 it is time to stop saying god bless america and begin repeating god save america the good news is that we will build even greater public support for a true political revolution during the mccain presidency all too often things must get much worse before they can get better they will get worse

5722859 nurse unions should work together to win a fair union election process for the 85 of registered nurses in america who dont have a union not fight over the 15 who already do
5722860 we continue to hope that we can reach a national understanding with the cna that will include a no raid no interference agreement
5722861 beyond that we have a situation where the cna obtained a tro by the use of incorrect statements and half truths for example that mr
5722862 the geranium stop i didnt need to go further actually didnt need to get
5722863 the st agnes election serves as an important reminder that management can almost always stop nurses from forming a union
5722864 hospital administrators routinely abuse their authority to interfere in a decision that belongs to nurses and our labor laws do virtually nothing to stop them
5722865 by contrast the cnas strategy is to fight other unions instead of fighting employers by raiding already organized nurses and intervening in seius organizing campaigns
5722866 nurse unions should work together to win a fair process for the 85 of registered nurses in america who dont have a union instead of fighting over the 15 who already do
5722867 toward that end seiu is renewing our call for a mutual no raid no interference agreement with the cna and other nurse organizations we look forward to participating in the mediation proposed by the afl cio to reach that goal

5722870 for months cna leaders have made inaccurate and exaggerated claims trying to cover up their own anti union tactics in ohio and other states they have produced doctored evidence they have made phony allegations and they have cried wolf
5722871 todays court decision shows the public what the cna is really about but thats little comfort for the thousands of ohio nurses and hospital workers who saw their dreams of forming a union destroyed by the cna its time rose ann demoro and the cna wake up and apologize to the workers they hurt
5722872 im a mom and a grandmom and ive spent my life caring for patients the last thing i thought anyone would ever call me is intimidating or scary
5722873 we just want the cnas leaders to explain what they did in ohio and stop their union busting
5722874 the cnas injunction against seiu was nothing short of a media stunt meant to chill free speech by seiu members and supporters
5722875 this kind of abuse of the law is exactly what californias anti slapp statute is intended to stop
5722876 cna leaders have waged a dishonest and desperate campaign to divert attention from the truth that theyve robbed more than 8 000 ohio workers of the right to form a union
5722877 their latest trick was the cynical use of important laws intended to protect people from real abuse and harassment most often women and it simply went too far
5722878 californias anti slapp legislation is designed to ensure organizations like the cna cannot stand in the way of the first amendment rights of seiu workers or anyone else simply because they don t like being criticized
5722879 the true victims of what happened in dearborn were not the conference goers and not the seiu members who came to protest
5722880 the true victims were the ohio hospital workers who fought for three years to form a union but who saw their hopes and dreams disappear when dozens of cna organizers landed in their hospitals now their story is being drowned out by all the inflammatory rhetoric surrounding the labor notes conference just as the california nurses association hoped it would be
5722881 i was quite surprised to learn that you had accepted the untruthful accounts of what happened in dearborn as a violent attack orchestrated by seiu and even put out a press statement to that effect despite the fact that you werent even there
5722882 i appeal to you as a leader of the american labor movement as a former member of seiu and as man of faith to help us put the false and misleading stories to rest
5722883 i wish i were a member of seiu but i was denied my right to vote for the seiu union and i was denied by the california nurses association
5722884 im here because of rose ann demoro they were going to honor rose ann demoro at this conference and shes a union buster we have a conference of unions and people and they are going to honor a union buster
5722885 stalking of use of violence against and harassment of officers directors and staff of the california nurses association
5722886 this is an entirely frivolous injunction being used for political purposes
5722887 the cna designed their suit to interfere with seius legitimate constitutionally protected free speech activity the cna ran into court and procured the order without giving seiu notice or an opportunity to be heard once seiu gets its day in court this illegal injunction will be overturned very quickly
5722888 employees subject to violence or threats of violence at the workplace
5722889 under no circumstances have seiu members or staff harassed cna members or leadership
5722890 its shameful that the cna is continuing to spread misinformation and distorting reality to divert focus from the real issues the anti union tactics that sabotaged the opportunity for more than 8 000 nurses and other hospital workers in ohio to freely choose whether to form a union with seiu
5722891 we want to move forward and negotiate the best possible contract so we can deliver the best possible care
5722892 we will sign a mutual no raid agreement with the cna and its allied organizations anytime and anywhere
5722893 its time to work together to unite the 85 of registered nurses who don t have a union instead of fighting over the 15 who do
5722894 to freely choose whether to form a union with seiu
5722895 we were in the middle of our meal when all of a sudden the private security guards hired by the cna whisked all of the cna people out of the room
5722896 a spokeswoman for the dearborn mayor told bna april 14 that there were no arrests and the seiu members dispersed without incident when the police arrived on the scene she added that one woman was startled when the seiu group came into the hotel resulting in her falling and hitting her head the fall did not occur because of criminal action she added
5722897 i was at the banquet talking quietly with people at my table then there was a ruckus in the back of the room someone went to the microphone to talk about what the cna did in ohio and the conference organizers tried to take the microphone away there was some back and forth and some shouting but no physical violence of any sort we continued to chat at our table
5722898 our plan and my own goal was to march peacefully into the board room and support our chp sisters as they spoke and handed out literature about their stolen right to vote for their union however the cnas supporters in the room ran out to confront us and used physical force to prevent our group from entering the ballroom and voicing our dissent after only a few feet i found myself dodging out of the way of getting tackled they started to attack us i ran past about three men who tried to stop me by tackling me i was about 10 feet away from the ballroom room door at the point that i was slammed into the ground
5722899 heres what happened we stood outside and protested peacefully then the doors came open and we went inside we didnt go into the banquet room only the hallways we had friendly conversations with people in the hallways and we chanted shame on cna the only violent part was labor notes pushing us out of the building it was a peaceful loud demonstration we wanted to make our voices heard i cant believe that cna is claiming that we were violent after what they did to the chp workers
5722900 union is wary of its new rival on the scene an area leader says california nurses group is
5722901 it doesnt directly affect you so therefore it must be ok
5722902 but it harms them and self harm should be illegal
5722903 rose ann demoro does not embody the values of dsa
5722904 as the head of the california nurses association rose ann used the exact same tactics as corporate america in stopping ohio workers from organizing
5722905 unfortunately we did not anticipate that the cna would take the place of the national right to work committee in launching a campaign to destroy this historic opportunity

5722908 nobodys come up with a way to prevent this from happening even here in the u s
5722909 the u s is probably more internet dependent than any place in the world so to that extent were more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack
5722910 so much of what were doing in the united states is out there on the internet and all of that can be taken down at once
5722911 this is such a crucial issue at every level our security now is dependent on computers
5722912 its a whole new era political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
5722913 it only takes a couple of experts it doesnt take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off
5722914 for a very small investment in resources you can have a huge impact
5722915 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
5722916 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
5722917 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
5722918 youd see some disruption of essential services like electricity youd definitely see espionage
5722919 would it be decisive no nobodys going to win a conflict with the united states in cyberspace but would it be disruptive and irritating yes
5722920 we dont know quite what the rules are for this kind of conflict if its spying its illegal but is it an act of war and who do you arrest
5722921 were much safer in the u s than we were a year ago but we still have a long way to go
5722922 she is one of the first persons in the uk to be taken to court by computer game manufacturers protecting their copyright
5722923 oh hey neighbor dont mind if i stop by do ya great i just ordered a pizza lets get comfy on the couch i brought scrabble too
5722924 hey you dont mind if i measure in here do ya im supposed to have a hot tub delivered tomorrow but my place is kinda cramped right now you dont mind if i park the ol tub here for a while do ya itll fit perfectly and you wont even know its here youd really be doing me a solid
5722925 specific localities still bear the hallmarks of deep poverty and the impact of government policy is at best marginal
5722926 for the residents of those communities there has been little change since 1996 and they can be seen very clearly to be still living on the edge
5722927 this educational failure is the foundation of poverty in wales and relegates a significant proportion of the population to labour market failure and consequent patterns of low income unemployment and benefit dependency
5722928 the geographical concentration of this population in the most disadvantaged localities in wales presents an almost insurmountable barrier to the regeneration of our poorest communities
5722929 contrary to stereotypical expectations these statistics are not solely the result of injury and industrial disease inherited from coal mining steel production and heavy manufacturing
5722930 limiting long term illness is evident in all age groups at higher rates than elsewhere in the uk
5722931 communities first areas i have had first hand experience of include maerdy 62 2 with long term limiting illness penygraig 57 5 penywaun 60 8 and treherbert 57 9
5722932 health aspiration is extremely low and local populations expect adulthood to include illness as a feature of life
5722933 many young people carry caring responsibilities from an early age with devastating impact on their educational achievement and their own health expectations
5722934 to sit in a public event in such communities is to observe community members in their 30s and 40s with severe mobility problems respiratory difficulties obesity visible dental damage and no expectation that things could be different
5722935 the overall impact on the quality of life is immeasurable
5722936 despite considerable rhetoric to the contrary government in wales has not yet created a more unified and joined up approach to poverty which recognises the articulation of education health and housing within the overall dynamic of poverty
5722937 clearly any assessment of progress toward that objective is premature and the 2010 review will be a critical verdict on wags progress towards the 2020 target
5722938 it is difficult yet to see any specific impact from wag derived policies
5722939 currently it is clear that whilst many communities have responded with remarkable speed and confidence this has neither been matched by assembly government funding or mainstream programme bending to assist them achieve regeneration of their communities
5722940 thirteen dead bodies including one for a pakistani national were recovered by afghan army forces
5722941 these kind of terrorist attacks would make firm the decision of international community in fight against terrorism
5722942 the operation has just ended and we have the dead bodies of seven taliban with six of them having suicide vests
5722943 the attack perpetrated against french soldiers serving in afghanistan is an unworthy and barbaric act
5722944 these french soldiers served freedom and democracy it is for these values that they fell
5722945 because carbon can reside in soils for a long time in a stable form soils harbor on the average two thirds of the carbon in the land based ecosystem
5722946 the earths soils have the potential to offset global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning by as much as five to 10 percent
5722947 knowing the limits of soils to serve as carbon sinks will allow environmental planners to better predict just how much carbon different soils can sequester
5722948 we introduce a way to relate wind stretch to dry air and dust which correlate very well with humidity in the western tropical atlantic
5722949 the index we proposed may provide practical implications for the prediction of atlantic hurricane activities
5722950 further studies are needed to discern the general prediction capability of our results
5722951 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5722952 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5722953 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
5722954 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
5722955 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
5722956 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
5722957 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5722958 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5722959 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared
5722960 in the future this new knowledge can be incorporated into developing new repellents and may be in control strategies for culex quinquefasciatus and other mosquitoes
5722961 presents as a very logical basis to help us understand how deet is perceived by the mosquitoes and this work provides an excellent explanation to link physiological processing within the mosquito to the macroscopic behavioral response that we observe in laboratory bioassays with this repellent
5722962 coal burning leaves toxic heavy metal legacy in the arctic
5722963 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
5722964 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
5722965 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies
5722966 impacts on human health in the arctic region havent been determined
5722967 after all the really social people did not invent the first stone spear it was probably invented by an aspie who chipped away at rocks while the other people socialized around the campfire without autism traits we might still be living in caves
5722968 i made a commitment to temple that i was going to make it and make it right
5722969 i never pushed to get it made until now because now we got it right
5722970 how we talk about autism how we talk about autistic persons directly impacts on how the public how people think about autism and how they perceive and act towards autistic persons
5722971 i hope to communicate to you that contrary to the unfortunate paradigm that has pervaded the media discourse about us autism is not a tragedy we are as with any other minority a community with unique needs strengths challenges and aspirations that are often distinct from the parent or professional voices that speak about us without us the true tragedy is the persistent discrimination abuse and lack of access that continues to govern societys approach to us on this the first ever world autism day we assert that it is this prejudice not autism itself that we have a true interest in combating in the interest of ensuring for every person the rights of communication inclusion self determination and respect
5722972 what does it feel like to be such a cruel and insensitive person
5722973 the 3rd annual charity car show sunday april 27 2008
5722974 fringe medical groups and parent advocacy groups who claim that vaccines cause autism or that they have too many
5722975 frankly i feel that parents who dont vaccinate their children are parasites
5722976 its irresponsible to suggest that virtually the entire medical community and the cdc and the american academy of pediatrics are behind a massive cover up about vaccine safety
5722977 african needs vitamin a more than they need vaccines right now
5722978 now you want me to tell you my opinion on autism since im not talking about autism a fraud a racket ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out thats what autism is what do you mean they scream and theyre silent they dont have a father around to tell them dont act like a moron youll get nowhere in life stop acting like a putz straighten up act like a man dont sit there crying and screaming idiot
5722979 now you want me to tell you my opinion on autism since im not talking about autism
5722980 dont act like a moron youll get nowhere in life stop acting like a putz straighten up act like a man dont sit there crying and screaming idiot
5722981 a fraud a racket in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out thats what autism is
5722982 in 99 percent of the cases of autism its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
5722983 savage is a brat who needs to be told to cut the act out
5722984 they dont have a father around to tell them dont act like a moron youll get nowhere in life stop acting like a putz straighten up act like a man dont sit there crying and screaming idiot
5722985 autism speaks can go away i have autism i can speak for myself
5722986 we decided to announce the deal today because this is the first day of autism awareness month
5722987 i am planning on completely restructuring the organization to meet the needs of people with autism for the first time
5722988 i am planning on firing everyone on the autism speaks board and replacing them with actual autistic individuals
5722989 i just dont think it will be easy to get rid of autism speaks negative image in the media and turn it into an organization that supports people with autism but if anyone can do it it will be wrong planet and alex plank
5722990 i understand that autism speaks is a horrible organization but thats why i purchased it i think we can convince all the parents who currently belong to autism speaks to change their views perhaps they will even start to see autistics like myself as humans not just diseases that need to be cured
5722991 i think its hurtful that people with autism are actually standing up for themselves its absolutely disgusting now im going to have to find another outlet to express my hatred of people with autism
5722992 i think the best part of this is that instead of only permitting parents to take part in an autism organization people with autism will actually begin to have a chance to determine their goals
5722993 free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment
5722994 the two high functioning boys so bright and charismatic will leave the mistaken impression that most children with autism are like this
5722995 mom i need to put you on the spot you need to be a better listener

5723018 egs could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
5723019 innovation is the path to massive quantities of cleaner cheaper energy the people were funding today have a real shot at lowering the cost of egs and bringing us closer to our goal of renewable energy cheaper than coal
5723020 egs is critical to the clean electricity revolution we need to solve the climate crisis but egs hasnt received the attention it merits thats why were pressing for expanded support from government and increased investment from the private sector
5723021 were big believers in egs and were looking for more opportunities
5723022 weve made a conscious effort to move the concept of the condom away from negative association like hiv and sex work
5723023 condoms are actually health products and if you have a condom and you use it you are seen to be smart and responsible
5723024 its a way to show you are a condom user and you dont have any issues with it

5723033 the tests intended objectives were not met to say the least
5723034 we know we are continuing to face the headwinds of the economic and retail environment consequently we are approaching the near term conservatively and believe our operating margin will decline from 2007 levels
5723035 are fighting for the cause standing shoulder to shoulder with men
5723036 persistent shelling in this area where two weeks ago a large number of internally displaced people sought refuge forced them to move again further inside kilinochchi
5723037 such multiple displacements are also adding to the delays in providing adequate shelter
5723038 many of the internally displaced people who are yet to receive temporary shelter and are thus still living under trees are struggling to seek shelter from the rain
5723039 sri lanka is a unique case of a government maintaining its offices and funding the administration in territories unlawfully occupied by a terrorist group
5723040 plans are under way to settle them in shelters located in safe areas prior to the commencement of the new school term there is absolutely no truth in the reports of internally displaced people living under trees
5723041 terrorists are now fleeing the areas in numbers following extensive military ground and air assaults
5723042 but rather of possessing articles intending they should be used in some way at some future time of preparing and instigating acts of terrorism the precise details of which such as time and place had yet to be finalized
5723043 is amongst the largest and most extensive ever discovered and thus makes this case one of the most serious of its type to come before the courts
5723044 this is going to be i think a historic transformation in pakistan its the first non violent peaceful constitutional change of power theyve had in many many years its crucial that washington give this new government this new arrangement at least six months maybe a year before offering its judgment about success or failure on such issues as the so called war on terrorism this is a government thats learning the ropes and has to persuade the military to be a partner in the struggle against islamic extremism
5723045 it is hoped that niue as host will take the lead in navigating change to combat the overwhelming effects of climate change and to encourage the pif to raise its stance on the issues of climate change and not just paying lip service but be active and promoting all means of renewable energy recycling re use and so forth
5723046 please dont focus on one particular topic this year we have great potential here for tourism and the forum must also focus on sustainable economies
5723047 it doesnt take a harvard mathematician to deduce this one builders are competing for sales with the large supply of foreclosed homes as well as with home owners in good standing with banks who are trying to sell their homes
5723048 right now there isnt a catalyst to jump start sales or the economy and its a major concern the housing sector is suffering from both the rise in foreclosures during 2007 2008 and a classic overbuild that typically occurs during housing booms in this particular cycle the overbuild was really high in florida california and parts of the southwest u s
5723049 late 2009 if we are lucky but theres only a 10 15 chance of that more than likely the housing slump continues well into 2010

5723091 pro choice people want abortions for everyone and think we should provide no support to mothers

5723096 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5723097 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5723098 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5723099 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5723100 everybody in this room could be donating to some other cause or to their own well being but i want to thank you
5723101 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement

5723104 warren said he thought mccain had been in a green room when questioning of obama began

5723106 the severe winds experienced during hurricanes and tropical storms have the potential to cause power outages throughout the commonwealth during this hurricane season

5723114 a provisional ballot could be cast successfully in multiple counties and not be detected until after the votes were certified
5723115 thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5723116 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting

5723120 many of us have probably heard the sermon about giving even the sermon about giving above and beyond the 10 some of us have even decided to go for it and gotten really excited about it from the safety of somewhere away from our cash we still dont do it though because were not giving out of our poverty we still think that our money matters so its impossible to part with it in any sort of revolutionary way

5723129 at this moment in time there is no discussion about a late move until members boards or participating teams clearly indicate their view as far as we are concerned the tournament will progress in pakistan
5723130 it is possible to postpone to relocate or to add a ninth or 10th team but at this point in time we have no indication to the contrary
5723131 the tournament is going ahead the teams have not withdrawn and we expect the best teams to participate
5723132 we are probably at a position where it is not possible to have a world class event elsewhere the shorter time frame the less likely that is of happening
5723133 its a complicated legal process something i cannot comment on at this point
5723134 i would like to think that the member boards would not send a weakened side because no life is worth less than another either you send you best side unless you decide the advice tells you differently

5723173 over the last few weeks it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be taken are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge
5723174 considering we tried to sell bejeweled outright to more than one industry giant back in the early days of our company and got no takers even after reducing our asking price to usd 60 000 this little game has done all right for itself
5723175 were big fans of gamesindustry biz by some measure its the best games trade site out there and im including the us ones too its a true must read site and several times a day at that the team have done a great job building it to such a position of strength
5723176 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5723177 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5723178 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5723179 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5723180 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5723181 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5723182 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5723183 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5723184 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5723185 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5723186 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5723187 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5723188 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5723189 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5723209 ends up i believe helping in the short term john mccain he has long warned about aggressive belligerent russia barack obama is playing it a little more safe
5723210 i think it really hurt barack obama that he didnt come off his vacation and come back and look presidential
5723211 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender

5723217 is something i felt i needed to do i feel like a professional musician for first time in my life
5723218 may be healthy for your work but it can be confusing to your audience it would be much easier to call things the jayhawks because that is a known brand name the number of people who come to my shows now is nothing compared to those who came to the jayhawks i expected a drop off but i didnt expect it to be quite so severe
5723219 legitimizes me in my own mind i always thought im good but i need to have these people around me the crew and a sound system it is much scarier to play in front of 10 people in a room especially if they are relatives instead of 50 000 faceless people
5723220 there is a lot of music in one form or another ive done for the dixie chicks or jayhawks or golden smog and most of
5723221 we are friends and things are not quite so sensitive
5723222 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5723223 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5723224 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5723225 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5723226 i wish more of our guys would play like that up here
5723227 its not their custom to play like that in china hey thats the way we play it in america i like seeing it the old thing you hear about nice guys they finish last
5723228 im sure it was frustrating for him to see all the other young guys called up to the big leagues i hope he understands why
5723229 probably the most positive thing is to watch all those young guys get called up and not let it affect his state of mind
5723230 if youre not going to be called up to the big leagues its nice to have the olympic experience
5723231 the sky is round and the earth is square it caters to the chinese spirit of the unity of the universe and humans

5723241 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5723242 musharrafs departure signals the end of a de facto presidential form of government in pakistan
5723243 he had concentrated power in his own hands by virtue of the fact that he was also head of the military
5723244 both the pakistanis and the americans are going to have to decide what kind of policies they follow with regard to foreign affairs and economics and that will depend in no small measure on the attitude that the us congress and a new us president will bring to the entire region
5723245 i hope all of pakistans friends will now seize the opportunity created by musharrafs exit to focus on the urgent issues of today confronting the threat of extremist violence dealing with food and energy shortages and helping the pakistani people build a stable secure democratic future
5723246 i hope that the elections for president musharrafs successor will serve to reconcile the pakistani people behind a leader who can solidify their government internally

5723257 one of the conditions of the coastal commission involves the subterranean parking garage where well have to dig out several thousand tons of dirt

5723340 how does opensolaris suns effort to free its big iron os fare from a linux users point of view is it merely a passable curiosity right now or is it truly worth installing linux format
5723341 there are fewer packages available than for a mainstream linux distro although they do have over a thousand and certainly enough for a fully functioning system the package naming is slightly odd package names begin with a handful of capital letters eg sunw or fsw
5723342 swan had a party on friday night she didnt invite me
5723343 everyone always dreams about winning but you never think theres a reality to something you dream about
5723344 i crossed the line and was thinking oh my gosh ive won im just so proud of myself
5723345 my coach has always told me you have to go in expecting to win even if you have a bad day or youre not the best in the field
5723346 he believes in me so much enough to say chris go out and win each round because why would you want to go to the next one knowing that someones beaten you
5723347 we have only two ways to deal with the rising electricity tariff either we protest and the government considers our problem or we pass the burden on to consumers
5723348 we are protesting against increase in tariffs and taking legal recourse but if we fail the consumer will have to bear the final consequences
5723349 if only inflation was to be considered the customer would be burdened with about 10 15 per cent increase in prices but prices of restaurant items may now go up by 15 20 per cent with the increased electricity tariffs

5723356 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5723357 especially since there is a clear lack of buying momentum
5723358 i think it is unusual to have such a large facility so low with the number of people who depend on that facility
5723359 one of the concerns that we have as water managers is people not recognizing the severity of the conditions

5723371 a lot of us went on to the pros it was great to be able to build something there

5723378 our analysis over the last few years has shown a significant amount of job browsing by senior it professionals but decreasing levels of actual movement
5723379 as the economic climate continues to worsen we expect nervousness among cios and it leaders will result in fewer seeking new positions and a subsequent reduction in the number of empty roles less movement in the market means more stability for employers and fewer disruptions from the churn of senior leadership
5723380 well i tried but i couldnt get rid of your illness sorry

5723384 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5723385 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at whatever level
5723386 but i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia

5723397 floods in the cuu long river delta happen every year so people are used to taking preventive measures for crops and life
5723398 in the past floods caused problem to transportation and it was hard for children to come to school but in recent years vietnam has built protective dykes and residential areas above the flood peaking level
5723399 since the floods are to wash away alum we expect the yield of the next winter spring rice crop to be good at least on par with this year
5723400 floods are forecast to rise above the average level in many years
5723401 the situation will go back to normal as soon as possible
5723402 they are all just going to come in at that budget
5723403 i do not think that buyers spend any time at all analyzing rfqs once they have sent them out they go directly to the price auction and get on a phone and those who cut the price get the business
5723404 we spend too much time working on rfqs the rfq process chews up dollars and time for something that is going to bring us no return
5723405 it rfqs will have a negative effect on my business we should charge the issuers of rfqs for responding
5723406 that the battle that is won before it begins is something the common man cannot comprehend
5723407 too many professional service providers still hear that their competitors were selected because the purchasing committee felt more comfortable with the people in the other firm
5723408 to consider the time that we spend together as being useful it is my objective to challenge and even inspire you to think outside of the framework of that with which you are most familiar and most comfortable in essence to empower you to see a particular situation through a new or different lens of understanding
5723409 pulling him and pushing him keep doing it telling people this is a sad moment and look hes not doing it
5723410 he goes i dont want to do it i dont want to do it
5723411 he kept pressuring him make him do the knife thing pulling him trying to get his t shirt off pulling and pushing him
5723412 swung it once or twice and said i dont want to do it any more
5723413 it was known that under 16s not allowed yet he came to us and forcing us
5723414 i ran 20 good hurdles i have 20 more left to go to get to my ultimate goal

5723418 this election year represents one of the most significant in political history making it even more important for the recording academy and the grammy foundation to bring an increased awareness of music issues to the policy makers from both parties at the democratic and republican national conventions
5723419 with grammys rock the conventions we hope to educate party leaders about the critical role of music and arts education regardless of ones political views its clear that when children have music in their lives we all win
5723420 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5723421 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5723422 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at whatever level
5723423 but i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia
5723424 the behavior of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia
5723425 the united states got precisely what we sought in this statement
5723426 its not everyday that a sovereign country is invaded and wrecked the events of the last few weeks should make us all realize that russia means business
5723427 i hope that i am wrong and that right now these beginnings of these movements which have been signaled but they were also signaled yesterday you know will result in a real departure but i am not sure
5723428 the team was a big part of my life back then and taught me so many things when i look back on my life and what im able to do its partly because of that early training it taught me discipline how to be committed about striving to win stamina all that good stuff

5723432 ruths appointment was a surprise to spaa however spaa has had good dealings with ruth in recent years and we look forward to working with her
5723433 when i went to the film commission it was quite a sad organisation an organisation with low morale and now its definitely not that
5723434 the organisation has transformed its bigger got more resources has an excellent relationship with government and in the wake of the lord of the rings its managed to create a holistic industry that is pretty connected through all levels
5723435 although the characters are composites of real men and time and place have been compressed every detail of the escape is the way it really happened
5723436 he felt it turned into something that was completely untrue
5723437 what to many people was an epic wartime film was to him a serious event
5723438 and i have met my destiny in quite a similar way
5723439 weve had a film thats had everything going for it including positive reviews and mccarthys previous success the station agent and we still just battle against the marketing of the large studio movies
5723440 theres no question because it is the most exciting and important voice in cinema
5723441 how many big studio films excite you or surprise you or make you think about things in a different way you just cant make a 100 million film where everyone is involved and expect to come out with an original vision one or two people every generation have the ability to do that
5723442 i guess it is a more intimate movie compared with other larger films because i take more time to develop character and explore that side of things rather than rush to locations or push to plot points
5723443 its one slow painful process of putting together story and characters in some kind of organic way and not starting out with an agenda
5723444 i wasnt writing very quickly or very often back in that period because i was very upset with the state of the world and thought there were bigger things to think about than just making up a story
5723445 and it wasnt until i had that political angle which came later that i felt it was justified in my work on some level
5723446 what they realised and i think what the visitor has done successfully and a large part of the reason its worked at the box office in this country the us is that its not just an issue film
5723447 its not like in the first scene we have an issue and we spend the rest of the movie resolving it immigration doesnt crop up until about 40 minutes into the movie and by that point youve had a chance to experience these characters and get to know them
5723448 in some way thats a better way to make a point raise an issue and get the audience involved in the story
5723449 theres something about directing thats a little bit more personally and professionally rewarding for me
5723450 its funny timing because this four or five year period has kind of redefined my life a bit professionally
5723451 its the first one of these films ive ever done and im really excited to see how they do it
5723452 decelerate to a snails pace if not completely grind to a halt
5723453 must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflationary pressures
5723454 we are excited to see the on screen chemistry and emotion this incredibly talented husband and wife team will bring to our show

5723483 waiting until the autumn whilst the stamp duty speculation continues to rumble on will have a devastating impact on the economy

5723485 the target of 240 000 new homes per annum by 2016 is now impossible the nation is also facing a severe housing supply crisis
5723486 in the last few weeks there have been signs that the housing markets deterioration was slowing with a number of key indices including the halifax showing a slow down in price falls
5723487 our own portfolio of over 2 500 units has also shown a slight uplift in reservations this could well be the first indicator that we have reached the bottom of the market with transactions at an historic low level the only way now can be up

5723498 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5723499 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5723500 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5723501 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed

5723525 but having examined the evidence which led to this particular budget initiative we have made a decision that we will not be supporting the excise increase that will raise around 3 billion over the next five years
5723526 we are concerned that it has the potential to compound the problem of alcohol abuse in young and not so young australians
5723527 and were also concerned that it has the potential to lead to displacement from alcohol to other forms of substance
5723528 certainly i heard today at the forum for example that young people in a club or party environment are paying 10 12 for an alcopop can purchase an ecstasy tablet or some other stimulant for 15 to 30
5723529 but im not suggesting for one moment that the increase in the tax is leading to increased drug use
5723530 if the liberal party are about to put their hands up to maintain a tax exemption or a special tax treatment for this category of alcoholic drinks which is specifically targeted at young girls the question i want to know is what do they believe the binge drinking rate will become on young girls in the future once they take this action
5723531 if i have seen farther it is by standing on the shoulders of giants

5723550 in 1973 through the roe v wade and doe v bolton decisions the supreme court took it upon itself to steal personhood and all rights associated with personhood from the preborn children of the united states
5723551 this year oct 6 marks the first day of the supreme courts term as a reminder to the nation that these childrens hidden and court sanctioned deaths will not be forgotten
5723552 pro lifers are determined to end abortion stand up for human life and proclaim the personhood of the preborn from the marble halls of government to the classrooms of our nations schools

5723554 we did what they said to do we elected all these people we got conservative justices appointed at the bench and nothing happened said tony jones the 40 year old leader of emergent village a national group that often speaks for more liberal christians from an evangelical background

5723556 it was only by the grace of god that nobody was hurt
5723557 todays sentence recognizes the significant threat that gorbey posed to the public at large and to those government officials he believed had offended him
5723558 as the court noted today but for the professionalism and patience of the uniformed members of the us capitol police this could easily have developed into a deadly confrontation this case serves as an important reminder of the risks that law enforcement officers take each day to protect the citizens employees and institutions of the nations capitol
5723559 i am very proud of the us capitol police officers who successfully prevented a dangerous felon from inflicting harm to our community
5723560 we also want to thank the assistant us attorneys for their outstanding work and prosecution of gorbey these outstanding efforts and the combined teamwork have resulted in getting a felon off the streets
5723561 which existing supreme court justice would you not have nominated
5723562 from 1974 to 1977 thomas was an assistant attorney general of missouri under then state attorney general john danforth
5723563 in 1981 he joined the reagan administration from 1981 to 1982 he served as assistant secretary of education for the office of civil rights in the u s department of education from 1982 to 1990 he was chairman of the us equal employment opportunity commission
5723564 in 1990 president george h w bush appointed thomas to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
5723565 i dont think he was an exp a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation
5723566 was it that barack obama didnt like justice thomass vote on the recent child rapist case kennedy v louisiana no that couldnt be it barack obama agreed with thomas on that decision justice ginsburg meanwhile a liberal favorite on the court whom john mccain listed as one of his least favorite justices during the same forum opposed giving child rapists the death penalty so whats so wrong about thomas and so right about say ginsberg senator obama explain the logic he cant of course and still win an election which is why he agreed with thomas
5723567 was it that barack obama didnt like justice thomass vote on the recent d c gun ban case nope that couldnt be it either barack obama wound up ultimately agreeing with thomas and the majority on that one too
5723568 justice ginsburg on the other hand had issues with the second amendment in that case but you would nominate justice ginsburg senator obama
5723569 did obama disagree with justice thomas on the recent cross burning case virginia v black obamas favorite justice justice ginsburg wrote that cross burning bans are constitutionally suspect justice thomas disagreed and wrote a passionate dissent during oral arguments he said theres no other purpose to the cross no communication no particular message it was intended to cause fear and to terrorize a population does obama take issue with the impassioned thomas dissent

5723575 rick did an amazing job of asking the questions most of us would ask the candidates if we could
5723576 i just really liked how john mccain gave well stated answers he didnt even have to think he takes a stand barack has a charming personality he didnt always give the direct answer
5723577 i think obama did very well and he doesnt need to win a majority of this audience he merely needs to keep mccains support below typical trends but this was mccains best performance in memory for the first time i can think of in 08 at least he comes across as the kind of guy a lot of conservatives can want to vote for rather than merely settle for
5723578 but i also think that its worth noting that but i suspect he may be riding high for a while after tonight
5723579 obama wasnt just bad but that mccain was very good
5723580 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5723581 what about the millions of pounds of pesticide that havent been sprayed in the air to protect our crops because a safe and ubiquitous soil organism called bacillus thuringiensis engineered into the plants kills crop eating caterpillars

5723603 they go through a lot of details that arent really needed
5723604 online just gives you what you need nothing more or less
5723605 arent as troubled as some of us older folks are by reading that doesnt go in a line
5723606 thats a good thing because the world doesnt go in a line and the world isnt organized into separate compartments or chapters
5723607 without the required demonstrated competencies in the performance of the procedure
5723608 ensuring all californians receive quality patient care is our top priority
5723609 however we disagree with the states findings and we are appealing the citations
5723610 the hospital reviewed the incidents thoroughly then we reported them to the state
5723611 the state also came in at some point and reviewed these incidents they too were not able to find a correlation between the events and the adverse patient outcome
5723612 my dog died a month before i got back to my parents home
5723613 i would love to bring her everywhere with me if i could
5723614 simple jewellery as a part of home that you can bring with keep them safe and take them home

5723619 mobile has been a terrific homeport for us since we began service there in 2004 and were absolutely thrilled to be able to expand capacity from this port with the deployment of the carnival fantasy
5723620 the support of the local community particularly city and port officials and our travel agent partners has been nothing short of exceptional and we are very pleased to continue operating mobiles first and only year round cruise program
5723621 mobile is one of the nations most progressive cities a quality we attribute to our partnership with carnival cruise lines and our ability to build coalitions united around one goal a better mobile
5723622 todos estamos de acuerdo estemos a favor o en contra de la energ a nuclear todos estamos de acuerdo en que debe ser segura y ser segura es que no puede haber ni manipulaciones ni ocultaciones
5723623 por tanto vamos a actuar con contundencia en el expediente sancionador
5723624 i can no more walk away from him than i can walk away from the black community
5723625 were going after people who are persuadable people who may be likely obama supporters sporadic voters undecideds
5723626 we persuade we mobilize and we register thats what we do
5723627 when you get to the big four year presidential election the old patterns kick in
5723628 but it was clear what warner was doing and he held down votes which would have automatically gone to republicans can obama do that i dont know
5723629 the military vote is the most fascinating aspect of this thing
5723630 there is an enormous amount of ambivalence about iraq among people there they feel abused jacked around they never know when a loved one is coming home or not thats going to be a factor and mccain may suffer as a result
5723631 john mccain is loved by the military in this state
5723632 he understands the way we think obama is not going to win in virginia because he hasnt done anything he has no experience
5723633 but thats because we havent put the obama signs up yet
5723634 were sick of being jerked around by the oligarchs cartels and dictatorships
5723635 are like going back to the carter era all it did was make us more dependent on foreign oil
5723636 obviously sen obama is putting an awful lot of money into virginia both on the ground and on television and it is a state that has elected democrats recently
5723637 but its one we take very seriously and one we think still leans for us and one we will fight for every single day
5723638 its really remarkable how extremely popular mr mark warner is
5723639 both mr obama and mr warner are going to washington to change it
5723640 that we intend to fight for every vote were fighting everywhere
5723641 obama can carry virginia but it wont be the state that puts him over the top
5723642 other larger national forces will have to be in play for obama to win virginia wont do it for him
5723643 he is a cultural candidate hes a harvard guy not a down and dirty guy hell take the college towns the african americans the urban affluents but he wont take harry hunter he cant even bowl
5723644 a month ago i would have said im voting for obama but now im not sure
5723645 i voted for bush twice and im disappointed he doesnt seem to be engaged
5723646 does obama have the experience this business with russia and georgia made me think about that at this point i just dont know
5723647 you can do it faster better and cheaper so why do it at all
5723648 then reality sets in they realize its not that easy to set up an internet based hands off cash cow
5723649 based on the foregoing we conclude that the trial court properly admitted state s exhibits 1 2 and 3 and related testimony concerning dna analysis and the subsequent test result without the testimony of the laboratory technician who performed the actual testing and pendergrass confrontational rights pursuant to the sixth amendment of the united states constitution were not implicated when he was denied the opportunity to confront and cross examine the laboratory technician who performed the dna analysis affirmed
5723650 from our perspective the plans creators really missed the ball on the issue of what sustainability means
5723651 these are folks who have been incarcerated or on public assistance
5723652 when they rebuilding the bronx and the city through ecological restoration
5723653 theyre also rebuilding their lives and it affects not just them but their families as well
5723654 everything on the street oils anti freeze trash metals all that gets released into the river untreated
5723655 it means kids cant play out in the river on a summer day or on the beaches
5723656 every dollar we put into expanding sewage treatment facilities is one less dollar to put into doing something that has multiple benefits do we want to invest in one thing that only gives one type of yield
5723657 or do we want to invest and spread the rewards in terms of cleaner air reducing the heat island effect providing jobs creating habitat space and improving the quality of life and the psychology of our community seeing green space as opposed to just the urban gray concrete fabric
5723658 right now the important thing is that city agencies make the credits easy to apply for and make the process open and transparent
5723659 it would be more of a layout and production thing
5723660 we want to reward the fans with a classic hood album and dvd that will showcase gucci mane at his best
5723661 this fall we are releasing hood classics which will feature hot singles that never made it to mainstream
5723662 this is a must have collectors edition for guccis fans
5723663 born in alabama and raised in the streets of atlanta
5723664 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
5723665 i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5723666 the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5723667 use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election
5723668 we have lost over a thousand american lives and spent billions of dollars since the surge began but iraqs leaders still havent made hard compromises or substantial investments in rebuilding their country
5723669 and while we pay a heavy price in iraq and americans pay record prices at the pump iraqs government is sitting on a 79 billion budget surplus from windfall oil profits
5723670 osama bin laden and the same terrorists who killed nearly 3 000 americans on our own soil are hiding and plotting seven years after 9 11
5723671 as commander in chief i will have no greater priority than taking out these terrorists who threaten america and finishing the job
5723672 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5723673 american leadership means getting engaged earlier to shape events so that were not merely responding to them
5723674 i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5723675 you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5723676 our nation is spending 700 billion overseas every year to countries that dont like us very much
5723677 when im president thats going to stop were going to achieve energy independence and were going to do it by using every resource at our disposal to get the job done including new offshore drilling

5723739 i just try to go by what people tell me
5723740 im just trying to get myself back to where i want to be and get to being a quarterback again
5723741 being around the guys again thats enough to keep me motivated im sure there are people who dont think i can come back from my injury
5723742 deuxi me grand enjeu un volet socio conomique il faut absolument quil y ait une meilleure appr hension par les europ ens de ce que peut leur apporter leurope dans leur vie quotidienne il y aura et cest cela que servent les discussions avec la commission europ enne d s aujourdhui de nombreuses mesures concr tes par exemple des mesures en faveur des pme notamment pour le financement des pme innovantes cest tr s important puisquil sagit de mesures en faveur de lemploi et de la croissance des mesures sur l largissement probable du syst me erasmus aux apprentis lextension et le renforcement des comit s dentreprises europ ens une directive tr s importante pour lutter contre toutes les formes de discrimination discrimination fond e sur les handicaps les orientations sexuelles etc parmi les mesures envisag es figurent aussi le plafonnement du co t des sms intra europ ens qui fait suite une premi re mesure qui a permis le plafonnement du co t des communications t l phoniques par portable en europe
5723743 cest pour cela que les tats membres ont donn comp tence lunion europ enne dans le domaine du droit international priv dans le trait damsterdam
5723744 cela tant pour que la coop ration renforc e voie le jour il faut encore que la commission fasse une proposition formelle et quune majorit qualifi e d tats laccepte majorit qualifi e qui nest pas encore r unie
5723745 un plan machiav lique et parfaitement enfantin me vient soudain lesprit
5723746 je ne suis pas expert en droit prive mais je vais essayer dexpliquer pour quoi la situation actuelle des divorces de couples binationaux est intenable et inique la situation actuelle cr une vaste incertitude juridique dans les couples binationaux europ ens en cas de divorce et une situation diniquit qui affecte des milliers de personnes et leurs enfants en europe pour la bonne raison que la multiplication des changes multiplie les mariages binationaux des lors cest une question europ enne puisquelle affecte les citoyens de lunion il nexiste pas de conventions internationales sur le divorce mais seulement sur sa reconnaissance convention de la haye et sur les conflits de juridiction entre juges des affaires familiales convention de bruxelles ou gen ve jai oublie la jurisprudence en france est un bordel sans nom bien que cela se soit peut tre am lior depuis dix ans derni re fois ou jai fait du droit prive international il y a eu plusieurs revirements de jurisprudence les cas les plus c l bres sont les couples franco allemands ou il est courant que les juges des affaires familiales refusent de coop rer et rendent des d cisions contraires par exemple les deux tribunaux rendent un arr t donnant la garde exclusive des enfants au parent de nationalit de la cour du pays dont il est national malgr les conventions internationales entre france et allemagne je crois quil y a eu un accord binational car ca commen ait aller mal avec des parents venant prendre les enfants dans lautre tat et utilisant leur arr t national pour refuser la garde a lautre parent le conflit de droit est logique car corr lativement sa conception du sp cifique du mariage un pays aura une position sp cifique sur la question de sa dissolution et de ses cons quences le code civil fixe une r gle unilat rale il pr voit lapplication de la loi fran aise quand les poux vivent en france quelle que soit leur nationalit ou si aucune loi trang re ne se reconna t comp tente on ne se soucie plus de la loi trang re on se contente de fixer le champ dapplication de la loi nationale vous voyez vite les conflits de juridictions qui peuvent se passer si la d finition du pays tranger est diff rente soit les deux ont juridiction soit aucun plut t le premier le droit comme la nature a horreur du vide pire source de conflit le tribunal fran ais est comp tent pour interpr ter les termes dun contrat de mariage qui na pas t contracte en france ce qui fait que la reconnaissance de la r pudiation pr vu par un contrat de mariage marocain est valide en france sous r serve dordre public dou lhistoire de lille r cente
5723747 ils se d chirent pour la garde en oubliant quil sagit des petits tres qui ont besoin vital des deux parents et des parents qui sachent parler dune seule voix m me sils sont s par s
5723748 si j tais divorc e bon il faut que je me marie avant il ne me viendrait m me pas lid e de critiquer le p re de mon enfant au contraire sil faudrait je rajouterais plut t des superlatifs car lenfant na pas subir le d samour de ses parents il a besoin d tre fier de son papa et de sa maman
5723749 les hommes politiques europ ens ne respectent pas le non irlandais
5723750 si les 26 autres membres de lue ratifient le trait dans leur parlement alors lirlande doit changer davis et soutenir le trait
5723751 les dirigeants europ ens qui tentent de forcer lirlande voter nouveau jouent un jeu tr s dangereux et il semble que brian cowen pourrait mettre son avenir politique en jeu sil demande un nouveau vote
5723752 en paraissant forcer la main des lecteurs les hommes politiques europ ens conduisent en fait beaucoup de gens dans le camp du non
5723753 si on lit un pr sident en ue il sera allemand
5723754 si on lit une pr sident en ue il faudra quil soit lu au suffrage universel

5723785 or tout le monde est daccord pour reconna tre quil ne serait contreproductif dorganiser trop rapidement une nouvelle consultation surtout au moment o le pays sera plong en pleine r cession
5723786 les irlandais qui ont vot non en partie pour viter de perdre leur commissaire vont ainsi se rendre compte que leur vote na servi rien ils ont adopt nice par r f rendum rappelons le et que les tenants du non leur ont menti
5723787 si lunion europ enne explose qui se frottera les mains
5723788 la ratification du trait de lisbonne contribue renouveler le prestige de litalie aupres des italiens
5723789 je me demande sil est vrai que ce trait nous pr pare une dictature technocratique
5723790 ce que la loi a fait une autre loi peut le d faire quelque soit lorigine de cette loi vous remettez en cause la d mocratie repr sentative

5723803 se r jouir dune fin proche de lue cela signifie aussi ne plus parler de solidarit avec les roumains bulgares polonais italiens irlandais et tout les autres

5723873 ne serait ce que pour leur rappeler que gr ce eux lunion va en rester pour longtemps au trait de nice
5723874 mais ce tour de passe passe est il juridiquement possible un examen attentif du trait peut en faire douter
5723875 il faut le souligner parce quon se demande si cest une provoc ou un gag involontaire qui au monde accepterait dexaminer attentivement un machin pareil

5724185 je pense quil est inutile de vouloir prouver que la turquie est asiatique elle est en asie

5724209 cest justement contre lempire ottoman que se constitue lid e moderne deurope
5724210 je nai rien contre lempire ottoman ou bien la turquie mais ce nest pas leurope selon moi et pas mal dhistoriens dont je vous d fis de mettre en cause le professionnalisme
5724211 on situe souvent la fin du moyen age 1453 date de la chute de constantinople donc si je vous suis bien la turquie faisait d j partie de lhistoire europ enne une poque le moyen age o elle nexistait pas tr s fort
5724212 je nai pas mis le sujet de la langue turque sur le tapis vous avez voulu d montrer le caract re europ en de la turquie en pr tendant faussement que le turc tait une langue indo europ enne je nai fait que corriger votre erreur ayez lhonn tet de le reconna tre

5724219 une preuve suppl mentaire de la disconnection entre histoire europ enne et histoire turque est fournie par les deux autres moments clefs que vous signalez comme pouvant marquer la fin du moyen age la chute de cordoue et la d couverte de lam rique en quoi la turquie tait elle impliqu e ou concern e par ces v nements sinon de mani re tr s indirecte
5724220 vous narriverez jamais d montrer que les ottomans nont pas t troitement imbriqu s dans lhistoire de leurope et quils ne font pas partie de lhistoire de ce continent au m me titre que les su dois ou les britanniques chacun avec ses particularit s son h ritage et ses traces propres et le minuscule isthme du bosphore ny changera rien

5724226 ne d formez pas mon propos je parle de la notion moderne deurope
5724227 maintenant ce que je serais curieux de savoir cest comment vous justifier lexclusion de la syrie du liban ou de la palestine pas t tout autant imbriqu s dans lhistoire europ enne que la turquie

5724236 en tout tat de cause l largissement de lue doit faire lobjet dune ratification par les pays membres
5724237 et si demain la syrie devenait membre du conseil de leurope je suppose que vous viendriez me donner des le ons
5724238 la syrie et le liban sont des entit s propres tr s r centes ensuite parce que m me du temps de lempire omeyyade ou de lempire abbasside linteraction avec leurope est beaucoup plus limit e dans lespace et dans le temps quavec lempire ottoman et la turquie

5724248 je ne vous dis pas demain mais dans 50 ans qui sait
5724249 quimporte ce que pense erdogan des valeurs turques ou occidentales
5724250 lue ne se construit pas sur des valeurs mais sur du droit
5724251 au nom de quoi disent ils refuserait on lint gration aux turcs si et quand ils rempliront les crit res de copenhague
5724252 regardez les textes nous disent ils la constitution les lois
5724253 le royaume uni jaurais parfaitement pu concevoir que pour construire leurope on d cide de se passer du r u europ en ou pas mais sans ce pays la construction europ enne naurait aucun sens cest dire serait irr alisable contrairement au d lire de r jolly sur un ancien fil
5724254 vous reprochez donc la turquie davoir trouv elle m me lantidote politique lint grisme islamique
5724255 rien ninterdisait au portugal et lespagne de signer laele avec le royaume uni dans les ann es 60
5724256 vous nadh rerez que sous un certain nombre de conditions remplir et en attendant on surveille tout cela la loupe
5724257 mais votre discours g n raliste nest pas celui de ces organisations qui sont responsables et veulent agir en caricaturant la chine comme vous le faites les occidentaux nobtiendront strictement rien pour les chinois le seul but de votre attitude est de couper les relations franco chinoises cest un but strictement go ste ou id ologique cest selon cest franco fran ais
5724258 le g nocide arm nien est effectivement un blocage en france ne comparons pas avec lallemagne o le temps est diff rent 1945 limplication plus forte guerre mondiale atroce voulue par hitler et les m thodes industrielles
5724259 en tout tat de cause l largissement de lue doit faire lobjet dune ratification par les pays membres
5724260 je suis persuad que si leurope navait pas ainsi en permanence sem le doute sur ses intentions r elles depuis trois ans les turcs seraient aujourdhui exclusivement concentr s sur les r formes n cessaires et ne perdraient pas ainsi leur temps en querelles internes
5724261 sur une question simple et d terminante comme lavenir dun territoire un r f rendum ne me choque pas

5724269 l vous caricaturez la question pour ne pas y r pondre jaimerais savoir si vous tes contre le fait quelle soit candidate ou le fait quelle soit adh rente et dans les deux cas en vous pla ant quelle date
5724270 personnellement int ressante la proposition derdogan de r unir une commission dhistoriens pour d battre de la question car cela revient implicitement reconna tre que la v rit officielle turque nest donc pas intangible
5724271 a part cela a mamuse toujours dentendre les arguments hostiles la turquie au nom de leurope puissance si on veut vraiment leurope puissance prenons la turquie
5724272 malheureusement nous avons adopt les immoralit s de loccident qui sont contraires nos valeurs
5724273 la soci t fran aise a travaill depuis 1945 sur son implication dans la shoah

5724275 je parle dun int r t politico religieux essayer de trouver une
5724276 tous les territoires europ ens disposent dun statut distinct entre les interreg i ii ou iii

5724281 guillaume clubcordelier question peut etre con la constitution belge et les lois actuelles donnent la flandre et tout autre r gion le pouvoir de d clarer son ind pendance ou dans ce but la r forme de letat est elle n cessaire

5724286 les faits cest ce qui est crit noir sur blanc
5724287 une question le pays regroupant la wallonie et bruxelles cest un r ve partag quitablement entre wallons et bruxellois ou cest comme jen ai lintuition plut t un r ve de wallons notamment pour garder un pays
5724288 nos int r ts sont compl mentaires notre culture et notre langue est fran aise avec quelques particularit s belges comme les bretons ou les alsaciens etc
5724289 je dirais plutot un erzatz pour politiciens en mal denvergure et demplois
5724290 bhv et les communes facilit s les discriminations linguistiques en r gion bruxelloise on sen fout
5724291 nous on est daccord pour votre conf d ration et pour des transferts financiers massifs mais on veut une r gion plus autonome dans le cadre de cette conf d ration
5724292 on nest plus les alli s des wallons on est daccord avec vous les flamands mais vous nous prenez en consid ration en change
5724293 bruxelles nest pas ses yeux une r gion comme les deux autres mais une r gion statut sp cial
5724294 ce francophone qui est venu voler une flamande en lui faisant la cour
5724295 humanistes de flandre r veillez vous parce que tout ce quon lit et ce quon entend ne donne vraiment pas envie dapprendre votre langue parfois deux mots deux terribles mots suffisent pour comprendre la haine et la b tise
5724296 lanecdote que vous racontez au sujet de la tentative de
5724297 si certaines communes autour de bruxelles avaient le droit denvoyer les papiers en francais leurs administr s c est en contrepartie de la fixation de la fronti re linguistique accord de 62 sans consultation des populations concern es si on leur avait demand leur avis elles auraient t rattach es bruxelles
5724298 le fran ais est une langue internationale parl e par 500 millions de personnes dans le monde et est donc plus attractive que le flamand qui est parl par 25 millions de personnes sur une petite partie dun continent
5724299 nb en revanche je maintiens la valeur du parrall le que jai fais sur les anglais immigr s en bretagne et les francophones migr s en flandre
5724300 bourzy le pinchon o les fran ais sont chez eux
5724301 comme beaucoup de germains ils ne connaissent quun argument la force
5724302 a noter cest aussi comme cela que sest faite lunit de la france les langues et patois regionales taient bannis et le fran ais impos et au final cest tant mieux pour lunit du pays et le rayonnement de sa culture dans le monde
5724303 tonnant dailleurs cette propension des r gions germaniques riches fortement catholiques comme la bavi re la suisse al manique une partie de lautriche la flandre une partie de lalsace a vite pencher pour des partis dextr me droite
5724304 est ce la force des valeurs catholiques conservatrices associ es la mentalit rurale
5724305 les francophones de france les fran ais sont enti rement solidaire de ceux de belgique
5724306 il ne faut pas comparer de standaard avec le monde le premier est un journal flamingant
5724307 le juif doit dispara tre cest une question de sant publique
5724308 est ce la force des valeurs catholiques conservatrices associ es la mentalit rurale
5724309 jesp re que la belgique sortira de la crise mais dans le cas contraire la france sera toujours l pour fonder une forme dunion voir pour int grer la wallonie et bruxelles dans la r publique comme ce fut le cas durant la i re r publique fran aise apr s la r volution les francophones de france les fran ais sont enti rement solidaire de ceux de belgique

5724316 il ny a en fait quun plan qui marche arriver sentendre ensemble ce qui implique aujourdhui changer la majorit en flandre
5724317 a mon avis la seule solution durable pour sortir du conflit serait datt nuer les particularismes communautaires en d veloppant notamment le bilinguisme via lapprentissage oblig des langues pour tous les jeunes belges d s la maternelle a noter cest aussi comme cela que sest faite lunit de la france les langues et patois r gionales taient bannis et le fran ais impos et au final cest tant mieux pour lunit du pays et le rayonnement de sa culture dans le monde
5724318 fiquei desapontado mas os jogos ol mpicos t m uma m stica especial e mesmo as grandes atletas como a naide gomes podem ficar afectadas
5724319 der gef llte ranzen sollte am ende nicht mehr als zehn prozent des k rpergewichts des kindes wiegen
5724320 im durchschnitt hatte jeder ranzen ein gewicht das bei 17 2 prozent des k rpergewichts der kinder lag
5724321 das ist die nat rliche reaktion darauf dass sich durch den ranzen der k rperschwerpunkt etwas nach hinten verschiebt
5724322 selbst ein schwererer ranzen wird eine gesunde kindliche wirbels ule nicht sch digen dazu wirkt das gewicht viel zu kurz auf den r cken ein
5724323 selbst bei schlaffer muskulatur wirkt ein ranzen zu kurz auf den r cken ein um die passiven strukturen wie wirbelbogen gelenke b nder und bandscheiben sch digen zu k nnen
5724324 die empfehlung von zehn prozent stammt aus der zeit vor dem ersten weltkrieg sie bezog sich darauf wie schwer der tornister eines rekruten sein durfte damit bei langzeitbelastungen keine muskul ren erm dungen auftraten
5724325 diesen wert auf ranzen und schulkinder anzuwenden ist v llig unrealistisch
5724326 es gibt zudem keinen einzigen beleg daf r dass der r cken eines kindes gesch digt wird wenn es einen schwereren schulranzen tr gt
5724327 ihr haltungs und bewegungsapparat ist daher v llig unzureichend trainiert
5724328 sitzt ein kind dauerhaft nach vorn gebeugt werden vorwiegend die vorderen abschnitte der wirbelk rper belastet dadurch wird ihr wachstum an dieser stelle fr hzeitig gestoppt hinten wachsen die wirbel jedoch weiter dadurch entwickelt sich zunehmend eine rundr ckenform diese haltungsschw che wird schlie lich zu einem haltungsschaden der nicht mehr zu beheben ist

5724330 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
5724331 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
5724332 although the overall frequency of sleep insufficiency in children is unknown our studys prevalence of 26 percent may be under estimated due to the exclusion of children with known sleep disorders and other illnesses
5724333 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
5724334 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
5724335 these groups already are known to be at higher risk for hypertension and other adverse outcomes
5724336 their high prevalence of poor sleep quality and deprivation could be due to disruptive home environments and neighborhoods as well as unrecognized psychological and medical problems
5724337 meanwhile pediatricians should view sleep quality and patterns as an intervenable health concern
5724338 our data underscores the need to monitor quality and quantity of sleep as part of a childs overall health strategy

5724341 a case of west nile virus provides an urgent reminder to protect ourselves
5724342 wearing mosquito repellent whenever you are outdoors and long sleeves and pants in the morning and evening will reduce your risk of contracting the virus older new yorkers need to be especially careful they are more likely to become seriously ill and die if they are infected
5724343 this funding commitment underscores the government of canadas belief in this important initiative to improve the quality of life of canadians and their families dealing with mental illness
5724344 some of the best experts in the mental health field in canada are working with the commission
5724345 i applaud the government for its continued commitment to improve mental health in canada
5724346 for far too long mental health has not received the attention it deserves in this country
5724347 the canadian mental health association enthusiastically applauds the federal governments announcement of increased support of the mental health commission of canada this is a tremendous vote of confidence in the commission and a most encouraging sign of the importance of mental health as a national issue
5724348 the cmha looks forward to working closely with the commission in achieving its challenging mandate which will be much more feasible with this support
5724349 xenazine represents hope for patients and families dealing with this difficult disease
5724350 for the first time there is a treatment that can help patients with this disease gain some quality of life
5724351 the fact that we saw this abnormal difference in gene expression in at least 10 percent of the colon cancer patients and in very few people without colon cancer strongly suggests that it plays an important role in this disease
5724352 moreover if this difference is found in patients with colon cancer it should prompt a study of other family members who as determined by genetic counseling are likely to have also inherited the trait
5724353 it is likely that testing for this abnormal expression will eventually become part of clinical practice when evaluating a patients colon cancer risk
5724354 we and others must now determine the molecular cause of the difference so that we can begin to design ways to correct it and perhaps eliminate the elevated risk of cancer
5724355 there is magic in them there hills this is so true of the human soul and being you truly can do whatever it is that you ardently dream hope and desire
5724356 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5724357 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5724358 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5724359 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5724360 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5724361 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5724362 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5724363 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5724364 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5724365 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5724366 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5724367 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5724368 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5724369 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5724370 it is a fact that mrs schmitz is a state legislator it is not illegitimate or illegal for her to be a legislator and in need of a job her status as a legislator has inevitably become a part of her resume the government is attempting to stretch and twist this into a crime or a scheme and artifice there is nothing unlawful or illegitimate about requesting the help of others when looking for a job to say otherwise creates a slippery slope that criminalizes the use of acquaintances and professional associates or associations and without a doubt criminalizes what has traditionally been the most effective means of finding a job evidence that mrs schmitz asked others for help in finding a job is irrelevant to any fact that is of consequence and is inadmissible
5724371 as i told some of the investigators i made a call to mr johnson when she was forced out in madison county i think she went most of two terms before the board changed its policy and she bumped into me one day in the hall and said you know im going to have to resign theyre going to force me out apparently thered been some change on the board and it ended up one of the board members ran against her for the post i dont know all the details politically anyway it was a political thing because she had won several awards as a teacher so she said can you help me you couldnt put her back in another classroom situation so i made a call to mr johnson and asked him if he had anything he could give her that he thought she could do well thats all that was ever said and i guess a month or so later i heard shed been hired by the city program he just said hed look into it as i recall and that was all that happened thats the only person i ever recall talking to roy about
5724372 yes yes there were some problems in the two year system
5724373 in the house he was a long term supporter of ours on the floor ive been close to a lot of legislators yes he was close to us and he did a lot of the work for us on the floor and handled bills for us because hes such an effective debater
5724374 i know a gem of a person and i think she can do you some good work and i think you ought to consider her
5724375 if there is some person not doing their job somebody didnt oversee them there is not one person working in the two year system serving in the legislature that doesnt have someone over them to oversee whether theyre doing their job or not theres not a single exception to that except possibly a president i do believe that ones job requirements could disenfranchise one from the opportunity of serving i dont believe in double dipping you ought not to draw the same pay for the same thing at the same hour but nobody ever looked to see if they were doing their jobs they just made a carte blanche policy thats what i fussed about
5724376 has a binding agreement with central alabama community college cacc reinstating her to the position she had with the city program
5724377 has been reinstated to the very same position within the city program that the government is accusing her of utilizing as part of a scheme or artifice to steal over 177 000 from the city program
5724378 mrs schmitz and cacc and the city program are currently working to determine the amount of back pay if any owed to mrs schmitz as well as whether or not cacc and city will immediately move to terminate her
5724379 because there has been such great press coverage about certain leaders in the system there is a misconception that it is more widespread and deeper than in actuality it is its wide enough and deep enough for it to be a major problem but its not as widespread or as deep as some people have thought it is i would not characterize the situation here that way at all there were particular leaders here in the system some leaders here in the department who didnt behave correctly but i dont think you can lay that at the feet of the majority of people here in the department or out in the system the majority of people here in the department out in the system are good people who work hard and play by the rules
5724380 es gibt tats chlich so etwas wie das vergessene china
5724381 ich vermute dass wieder einmal die landbev lkerung darunter leidet
5724382 die chinesischen bauern waren schon immer darauf angewiesen brunnen zu graben
5724383 die bauern leben buchst blich von der hand in den mund
5724384 die wasserfrage ist meiner meinung nach das gr te problem nordchinas
5724385 die bauern haben das land ja nur gepachtet eigentum konnten und k nnen sie am vergesellschafteten land nicht erwerben
5724386 wenn ein industriekomplex oder auch eine ferienanlage gebaut werden sollen m ssen die bauern ihr land eben abgeben
5724387 die vergesellschaftung des landes ist das einzige berbleibsel des sozialismus
5724388 unsere neue celsius h serie ist das eindrucksvolle ergebnis intensiver zusammenarbeit zwischen entwicklern designern und der qualit tssicherung von fujitsu siemens computers

5724390 this step requires 90 percent less energy than in the previously used siemens process the conversion of trichlorosilane to monosilane consumes energy too but the overall energy savings is more than 60 percent by comparison the siemens technology requires up to 160 kilowatt hours per kilogram of silicon
5724391 in our partnership with joint solar silicon jssi responsibilities are clearly delineated evonik produces the monosilane and jssi produces solar silicon this makes sense because evonik has many years of experience in silane chemistry
5724392 suns intel xeon based product line has proven to be wildly popular with customers to keep up with demand we are already announcing the seventh and eighth xeon based systems since our strategic alliance with intel in 2007
5724393 today were extending the value of the line by introducing fast energy efficient systems with larger memory footprints that scale to address the needs of our hpc and web 2 0 customers
5724394 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective
5724395 ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
5724396 the stomach normally has a protective coating to prevent acid related injury but aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids impair the stomachs ability to form this barrier coating potentially leading to ulcer formation
5724397 furthermore these drugs may themselves cause injury directly to stomach cells and can impair the ability of platelets to form a plug in the event of bleeding
5724398 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin
5724399 what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors
5724400 the only plausible reason for doing this was to ensure that the f drive would not be available to use as evidence against him
5724401 power knew he was being investigated for a criminal offence and knew that it was inevitable that he would be charged with such an offence
5724402 the attorney general is currently reviewing the decision of the court in this matter

5724488 definitivamente la demora es m s bien por la planeaci n
5724489 creo que estas fases son por la planeaci n no podemos pavimentar si no tenemos toda la infraestructura hidr ulica resuelta vamos por pasos
5724490 definitivamente la demora es m s bien por la planeaci n este proyecto tiene tres etapas no podemos pavimentar sin la primera etapa
5724491 si viajamos a torre n zacatecas o mazatl n encontramos que esas ciudades tienen infraestructura mucho m s ventajosa que la nuestra y que en cierta medida esa misma circunstancia nos revela que aunque hemos venido avanzando falta mucho por hacer
5724492 creo que sigue siendo el tema n mero uno a atender en durango pero la sociedad debe saber que el gobierno no genera empleos sino que genera las condiciones para la creaci n de empleos
5724493 sin embargo yo creo que al margen de las evaluaciones tenemos que reconocer que todav a estamos en desventaja que todav a hay una gran expectativa que debemos cumplir para que la infraestructura que presentemos sea atractiva para el inversionista
5724494 la creaci n de infraestructura para el desarrollo de un marco jur dico y la seguridad p blica para que le den a los empresarios la certidumbre y la confianza de que en durango se puede invertir
5724495 creo que tenemos que trabajar en todos estos ejes para que se generen m s condiciones tanto para la gente que puede invertir y que es de durango como la que puede invertir de otros lugares del pa s o del extranjero

5724525 new york becomes a purple state and not a blue state
5724526 all islamic lands are one umma there must be a general call to arms without requiring permission from the father nor any other opposition
5724527 because of these sneaky and treacherous attacks as your commander in chief i have ordered the armed forces of the philippines and the philippine national police to defend every inch of philippine territory against milf forces and immediately restore peace in the affected areas in lanao del norte
5724528 we will not tolerate and will crush any attempt to disturb peace and development in mindanao
5724529 come up with concrete firm and decisive action to defend the peace loving people of mindanao
5724530 i assure the filipino people that the government will defend them at all costs against any move by any group that will disrupt our aspirations for a genuine and lasting peace not only in mindanao but in the whole country i am with you in peace we are all in this together
5724531 no one will be allowed to hide behind the peace process to escape the might of government
5724532 however we view the recent incidents with grave concern we must get to the bottom of these very disturbing incidents i strongly condemn these atrocious acts as i call for sobriety and vigilance
5724533 this is not a press conference this is just a taping
5724534 i think this should be resolved in a round table discussion instead of letting the guns do the talking so to speak
5724535 we already foresaw this thing would happen its a pity because we thought we are already at the brink of achieving peace then this thing happened
5724536 this is the milfs way of dramatizing their sentiment that if they cant get what they want through peaceful means they would resort to other means
5724537 we would also like to appeal for reason sobriety to be calm and not to be overcome by their emotions
5724538 to be vigilant and calm in this situation and to be responsive and mature in responding to the issues because we will not achieve anything with all these fighting
5724539 no amount of justification could placate the families of our dead and soothe the anxiety and fear of residents who have lived in peace and harmony throughout the years
5724540 it will not cower in fear in the face of open challenges
5724541 we know there are other groups opposed to the peace process and conducting sabotage operations
5724542 as far as i know there is an existing ceasefire in place and the recent milf attack on government forces is a clear violation of this ceasefire agreement
5724543 i urge president arroyo to immediately release funds from the emergency fund for the purpose of providing relief assistance with another war in their midst many of our brothers and sisters in mindanao particularly in lanao del sur and lanao del norte fear for the safety of their loved ones immediate resolution and a return to normalcy is urged the soonest time possible
5724544 itoy nagpapatunay na iyong kasunduan sa pagitan ng milf at ng grp government of the republic of the philippines ay isang bulok na kasunduan
5724545 the peace agreement is supposed to calm the situation but it actually increases calls for emergency powers the groundwork has also been laid for charter change the soldiers now were the same during martial law
5724546 we should not wage a total war yet this is an isolated case but continue the dialogue conduct the dialogue
5724547 i call upon all our leaders both muslim and christian to make a strong and unqualified call to end all hostilities between the government and the milf now is not the time for blame and finger pointing but for statesmanship on all sides
5724548 pakitokawan sa langon a maranao a taga sa iligan ago taga marawi or ingud wag pumunta ng iligan bukas kasi yon ang final na pasabog sa mga lugar na may ginagawang haram hotel bar videokehan disco sabungan binggo kasi doon itinanim or inilagay yong mga bomba this is to warn all maranaos living in iligan and marawi or other lanao areas not to go to iligan tomorrow because that is where the final bombing is going to be in areas doing haram such as motel bar videoke pub disco house cockfighting arena and binggo that is where bombs were planted
5724549 i appeal to my colleagues in congress and all local leaders in mindanao to refrain from discussing the merits and faults if ever of the moa memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain instead we should collectively air an appeal for sobriety as we try to find the best solution towards attaining peace
5724550 very bad sign that the milf chain of command is breaking apart

5724561 wir haben es hierbei mit einer sehr gut organisierten schmuggelmafia zu tun
5724562 das problem dabei ist dass nicht nur die arten durch derartigen handel gef hrdet werden sondern dass zudem ein enormer ansturm auf die einheimischen zoos losbricht denn in denen werden die eingeschmuggelten tiere dann betreut
5724563 sie k nnen selbst objekte mit geringem eigengeruch wahrnehmen und sind daher ideal f r die schnelle kontrolle von gep ckst cken postsendungen oder ganzen containern

5724601 just prior to the attack on moore bertuzzi had been on a shift to kill a penalty had missed the shift change and had remained on the ice for longer than the rest of his line
5724602 after being directed to get off the ice bertuzzi was on his way back to the bench when suddenly and without warning he turned around and skated back in the direction of moore and attacked moore this was not done under any specific or general direction or encouragement from crawford was a direct disobedience of the instruction that bertuzzi had been given from the bench to get off the ice and was a violation of bertuzzis duties which crawford could not be expected to have reasonably anticipated let alone control

5724614 the eta is opposed to this type of vehicle even if limited to motorways because the danger they represent outweighs the benefits
5724615 the company seems to have an uncanny ability to understand its users and read the market right they come out with so many new products that its just phenomenal
5724616 they provide customers with more and for most of the stuff you dont pay
5724617 its sort of a wining proposition no matter how they do it the more content google provides the higher the likelihood that their customers will be more satisfied
5724618 all of the talk that yahoo and microsoft cannot do search on their own is not helping either of them in terms of a consumers perspective
5724619 he has served his sentence and the authorities in vietnam will deport him he does not have any sentence to serve in london if he wants to stop wherever he wants to he can do that
5724620 the only problem is the countries he wants to go to because he has to get a visa
5724621 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5724622 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5724623 he certainly should return here where he can be managed
5724624 it would be appalling if he was able to go off to another country where he poses a high risk to children

5724626 last year at this time paul pierce kevin garnett and ray allen were all in boston and working out along with the majority of the younger players who had been there much of the summer they had a hunger right from the beginning to get that ring that had alluded all three of them throughout their careers they were on a mission to win the title right from the beginning fast forward to this off season and from all the reports paul pierce is still celebrating the championship he is in las vegas coming home from a club at 3 30 pm he is hosting mike and mike he is working out some but no where near the extent he worked out last off season there has been no word from kevin garnett and knowing him he is already deep into his off season work out regimen but he isnt working with the other two as a team like they did last season ray allen has been taking it easy and playing a lot of golf and that in itself isnt a bad thing he needs to get some rest after the playoff run but the point is there just isnt that drive and that hunger like they had last summer

5724628 the nba is poised to become the first major u s sports league to stream live games in local markets an aggressive offering that will set up a showdown between cable operators and regional sports networks the move marks the latest evolution in digital rights and adds fuel to one of the most contentious issues in local sports media as teams look to broaden their reach while operators look to protect the rights to their most expensive programming the nba has authorized its teams to launch three distinct digital services by the start of the 2008 09 season in late october video streaming interactive tv and video on demand
5724629 sonics fans pursuing a class action suit against clay bennett have laid out exactly what theyre seeking from the oklahoma city ownership group free tickets for the next two seasons of basketball at the ford center in the latest legal volley from the lawyers representing three sonics season ticket holders seattle attorney frederick schoepflin outlined a potential remedy for u s district judge richard jones noting it would be extremely difficult to force the team back to seattle in order to fulfill its promise to provide tickets for the same guaranteed price at keyarena through the 2009 10 season schoepflin suggested an appropriate solution would be offering nearly 1 400 sonics fans tickets at oklahoma citys arena at those same prices for the next two years
5724630 there are plenty of athletes who overcame a lack of talent by working harder than everyone else there are plenty of athletes who are good enough to thrive with putting in the practice time but not many combine special talent with a persistent grind to get better as does ellis as a result his three year career has already produced a spectacular ascension from high school hopeful to franchise figure thats why he was given a six year 66 million contract and the reins to the warriors franchise last month after davis opted out of his contract and signed with the los angeles clippers members of the organization are showing no concern about putting so much responsibility on ellis 22 year old shoulders instead of spending the summer swimming in his newly acquired wealth ellis is already preparing to meet expectations he is doggedly working on his ball handling this offseason and has plans to improve his endurance and strength by working out with trainer virgil hunter boxing coach of undefeated super middleweight andre ward of oakland
5724631 obviously bigger players are easier to judge when theyre young because their skills remain about the same only the refinement changes for instance howard was always better than emeka okafor lebron was always incredible kobe bryant was always a mid sized whirlwind who could play wing point guard whatever for guys under 6 5 and rubio is about 6 3 its different its harder they develop their skills in random ways sometimes they blossom out of nowhere sometimes they just get stuck at age 23 or 24 and never get any better their careers are less dependent on strength and physical dominance and tethered to subtler things like court vision speed through the lane leadership coach friendliness system friendliness health and shooting ability
5724632 hes tucked away outside a remote gate of a city park no markers on a tourist map no signs on the street hes surrounded not by incense but public toilets hes staring not into the future but at a parking lot those who visit offer him gifts not of gold and myrrh but projectile spit and empty water bottles but former lakers center shaquille oneal doesnt seem to mind here nobody can accuse him of not hustling because he literally is nailed to the ground here nobody can exhort him to work on his wooden hands because well the dude actually has wooden hands and here finally nobody can ever dare say that kobe bryant is bigger here the self proclaimed superman really is a super man all 50 feet of him
5724633 nuggets forward carmelo anthony is enjoying his olympic experience so much hes interested in returning for the 2012 games in london
5724634 ill be 27 years old actually 28 depending on what the process is i am open to 2012 we shall see what the process is
5724635 it is a grind but i dont think that from what im hearing there will be another three year commitment or something like that
5724636 so i will have to see that but if its come to play and try out in 11 or 12 then ill be good for that
5724637 its also worth nothing that while australia defended the u s effectively in shanghai they havent stopped anybody in beijing for the tournament as a whole theyre allowing 51 3 shooting and an almost absurd 46 4 on 3 pointers even their wins have been largely the result of superior offensive efficiency rather than anything brilliant they did on d
5724638 wade won the 2006 nba finals mvp and then he averaged 19 3 ppg while shooting 576 from the field in the 2006 fiba world championship as team usa won the bronze medal wade keeps claiming that last year he was written off faster than any other player of his caliber but while that is certainly a good motivational tool for him to use it is not really a fair or accurate statement there is a difference between correctly stating that wade did not play well last season versus making a blanket statement that he will never play well again wade is obviously healthy now and he has regained the explosiveness that enabled him to play at such a high level in 2006 however the wade that we are seeing in fiba play is not new nor does this necessarily indicate how he will perform during the upcoming nba season wades style of play results in him taking a physical beating and it remains to be seen if he will be healthy for an entire 82 game nba season while playing at an all nba level based on how wade looks now i certainly expect him to start out strongly in the 2008 09 nba season but well see what happens after that bryant and james have proven to be more durable and simply better all around players than wade so wades numbers versus fiba teams do not convince me that he is a better nba player than bryant or james
5724639 sono molto contento di essere qui non vero che aspettavo la chiamata di una grande squadra ma appena rientrato dalle vacanze ho saputo dellinteresse dellatalanta e mi sono preso qualche giorno per decidere insieme alle persone che mi sono pi vicino inizio questa nuova avventura con tanto entusiasmo dopo la delusione olimpica sono un giocatore pi di qualit che di quantit e spero di fare bene
5724640 i evaluate what i see and i have to have some credibility with my players
5724641 if you dont reward people who practice well you are in danger of losing the whole team
5724642 it was a hard decision we looked at every statistic that we kept from pass completions yards per catch yards after catch interceptions percentage of drives scoring good practices and bad practices we even consulted with some of the players
5724643 if one quarterback all through the spring and all through summer camp was statistically better in almost every single category
5724644 i think theyll all end up playing throughout the year to be honest with you
5724645 start accepting other markets other then of the us at 2 5ghz and in other spectrum profiles
5724646 el m ximo respeto a todo lo conseguido ya no es hora de homenajes y s de comenzar una nueva etapa
5724647 es normal que est un poco acelerado es un s ntoma de que se tiene emoci n por empezar y eso es importante en cualquier ejercicio de la vida
5724648 he vivido situaciones dif ciles y de gran responsabilidad y en una selecci n puede que se acreciente pero es parecido no hay mayor responsabilidad en un club que una selecci n
5724649 es lo mejor para m y para el f tbol espa ol partimos de una base y lo que hace falta es que sepamos cuidar todo lo que se ha conseguido y si es posible potenciarlo
5724650 mirar para atr s era una obligaci n m a en el plano humano y profesional
5724651 en el plano humano les hice ver la uni n y la humildad que hab an tenido en la eurocopa quer amos que eso siguiera porque el futbolista debe ser humilde y que el t tulo de la eurocopa no le cambie
5724652 en el plano futbol stico tambi n hay que mirar para atr s para atr s porque lo conseguido es importante el camino est marcado por eso en lo sustancial la convocatoria para este partido difiere muy poco de la que fue campe n de europa
5724653 es mi idea individualizar las charlas y ayer lo hice con los centrocampistas y les dije que tambi n son hombres b sicos para el futuro como lo han sido hasta ahora
5724654 me lo imagino como una vuelta a la normalidad y a la actividad y que el pasado no nos llegue a confundir
5724655 se puede ir cambiando luego en funci n del rival y de los partidos pero una idea base ya la tenemos
5724656 lo suyo es peor as que m s te vale hacerlo bien
5724657 estamos mas contentas que ayer dicen que en principio ha salido mejor pero bueno hemos luchado eso es lo que contaba ha habido un 9 7 del juez chino que era de esperar as que no pasa nada
5724658 creo que hay problemas con el tema de las luces es demasiado innovador en un deporte muy conservador

5724660 estoy estudiando sociolog a voy cambiando pero esta es la definitiva
5724661 me gustan dos cosas una el tener un equipo al lado el compa erismo que vivimos y otra esas emociones que hay cada d a extra as y diferentes que no sabes qu te tocar es lo que me gusta que no es mon tono
5724662 la cambiar a de deporte vemos otros deportes que son mas divertidos ente comillas como por ejemplo el waterpolo entre que tiene mucha recompensa y entrenan la mitad de horas pues son m s listos
5724663 el deporte te educa tanto f sica como mentalmente y sobre todo el deporte de equipo porque te hace m s persona

5724667 after the event in jaipur we ran a background check on hussain it revealed serious discrepancies which led to severance of our relationship with him this is normal action taken we have no other comments to offer
5724668 their attitude is aggressive and heartless and comes from a communal tendency
5724669 we admire this mans courage rashid has decided to fight against this injustice

5724696 and so the formula had begun launch a campaign build a microsite buy online media to drive traffic to it everything was in its place advertisers now had a presence on the web clients were happy about it and the big money was still being pumped into the traditional channels because thats how its always been done in the past year lots of us have had a grand ol time proclaiming the death of the microsite and with some validity fact is the internet is littered with thousands of them and the majority are either promotional in nature designed to win awards vs serving up value or simply provide no incentive to ever return to them on top of that most of the microsites i come across are difficult to use take way too much time to load crash my browser or use contrived marketing language written by professionals who have spent years perfecting their craft

5724779 here as the party challenging the summonses hogan has the heavy burden of rebutting the governments good faith showing
5724780 he has failed to carry that burden naked arguments and bald assertions without evidence in support of such allegations are insufficient to rebut a prima facie case for summons enforcement

5724783 clean coal renewables and yellowcake we must include nuclear in our future baseload clean energy mix
5724784 inconvenient truth that only nuclear power could provide baseload electricity while cutting emissions
5724785 burying mere tonnes of radioactive waste in geological stable rock was low risk
5724786 our view is that there needs to be consideration in australia given to the development of a nuclear power industry dr nelson said
5724787 we need more rational discussion about nuclear power in australia and much less of the emotive political debate weve had in the last few years
5724788 we cannot envisage any circumstance under which australia will have a nuclear power industry he said then
5724789 the last election showed that australians are absolutely of one mind about not having 25 nuclear power plants dotted around their suburbs and in and around their cities mr garrett said
5724790 are they really saying that they have a plan for 25 nuclear reactors in australia where are they going to put them senator wong said
5724791 australia has an abundance of renewable energy sources we have a lot of solar we have a lot of wind we have geothermal resources she said
5724792 she consumes a cocktail of prescription painkillers ambien sleeping pills and rum or vodka each night and during the day
5724793 when i have expressed my grave concern to her about her combining ambien with alcohol she flew into a rage and attempted to justify her addiction by claiming she has debilitating migraines and shoulder pain
5724794 i have observed her wake up on many mornings in a stupor from her nightly cocktail she is in no condition to drive in the morning
5724795 it is ludicrous for her to claim that she is afraid of me
5724796 we are concerned that it has the potential to compound the problem of alcohol abuse in young and not so young australians
5724797 and were also concerned that it has the potential to lead to displacement from alcohol to other forms of substance
5724798 certainly young people in a club or party environment paying 10 12 for an alcopop can buy an ecstasy tablet or some other stimulant for 15 to 30
5724799 but im not suggesting for one moment the increase in the tax is leading to increased drug use
5724800 from very early on dr nelson has sided with the spirits industry in opposing this measure
5724801 but from the early evidence that we have from the tax office this measure is being successful
5724802 australia needs a strong surplus to act as a buffer against international uncertainty and for the liberal party to blow a multi billion dollar hole in the budget surplus is the height of economic irresponsibility

5724827 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

5724830 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5724831 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war

5724833 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5724834 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

5724841 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

5724848 the russian states open hostility not only toward georgia but also toward ukraine and the baltic states is in this sense partly ideological genuine elections have taken place in all these countries people who have not been preselected by the ruling oligarchy sometimes gain wealth or power georgias rose revolution and ukraines orange revolution even involved street demonstrations that helped unseat more oligarchic regimes thus it is not pure nationalism nor mere traditional great power arrogance that makes the russian leadership disdainful of georgia and ukraine it is also at some level fear that similar voter revolutions could someday challenge russia too nevertheless the word superficial is worth repeating here as ive written before i dont really like historical analogies which can conceal as much as they reveal for one thing the ethnic conflict that sparked the georgian presidents foolhardy response and the russian invasion two weeks ago has been twisted and manipulated but it nevertheless involves real people any long term solution to the current crisis has to find some accommodation for the south ossetians whose homes and livelihoods have been destroyed in the exchange of fire todays russian leaders despite the paranoia they learned in kgb training have far more profound relationships with western institutions not only the g 8 and the council of europe but the western banks and companies that invest their money and manage their property todays europe is theoretically better prepared to engage russia though it has not done so until now on aug 8 i wrote that the west which failed for many years to address the security vacuum in the caucasus would have no influence over russia and in the short term this has proved true despite a cease fire brokered by france russian troops are withdrawing very slowly if at all we have no military means to force them out and should not pretend otherwise but if this turns into a long term conflict if the russian military remains in georgia proper if this proves to be only the first of more incursions into other neighboring states there are relationships we have and meaningful levers we can use whether over russian membership in international institutions or russian leaders luxury apartments in paris if of course we are willing to use them the critical question now is whether the west is prepared to behave like the west to speak with one voice and create a common trans atlantic policy in recent years russia has preferred to deal with western countries and their leaders one by one just last week an affiliate of gazprom the russian state dominated gas company added a former finnish prime minister to its payroll which already includes former german chancellor gerhard schr der if we hang together instead of allowing gazprom to pick us all off separately there is at least a chance that this minichill wont last another 40 years
5724849 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5724850 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5724851 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5724852 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5724853 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5724854 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5724855 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5724856 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5724857 though we live with thousands of different illnesses we have more in common than not for example illness impacts our families careers finances and daily living to name a few we can all learn from one another and share during this journey
5724858 and frankly people are tired of hearing but you look so good and they want others to know that their illness is legitimate despite how well they seem to be holding it all together
5724859 life disrupted getting real about chronic illness in your twenties and thirties

5725000 nr has learned that the mccain campaign has been calling key state gop officials around the country the last couple of days and sounding them out about the consequences of a pro choice vp pick the campaign is asking about the reaction of conservative grass roots activists to such a pick and whether a pro choicer can be sold to them this is an indication that the mccain campaign is serious about the possibility of a pro choice vp nominee and that mccain leaving the door open to tom ridge last week may not have been merely a friendly nod to a longtime supporter in this scenario mccains emphatic pro life statements saturday night and his pledge that hell run a pro life administration would have been partly an attempt to reassure conservatives in the event of a pro choice pick
5725001 with his name still buzzing among the vice presidential prognosticators returned tonight from the former soviet republic of georgia talking trash but his target was not
5725002 bidens prominent role in the speculation over s choice for running mate stems from his heft in foreign policy but it also comes from a belief in democratic circles that biden will do what the other vice presidential finalists and to some extent obama himself will not do fight back hard

5725017 the recent explosion of viral marketing tools provides evidence that easily accessible online content videos audio and interactive text has forever changed the way that readers reach out to the authors they love and discover what they want to be reading next online interactivity is the future of the romance genre and romance readers are among the most tech savvy of all consumers weve created avons new web presence specifically to enable readers to get a more integrated experience of author book and community
5725018 books that are sneak peaked get more than 100 times the visits of books that dont have online previews
5725019 its a win win situation fans get a taste of forthcoming novels before they hit shelves and when readers are allowed to browse inside a book early these page views are converting to the preview links being forwarded to a friend and book pre orders increase exponentially
5725020 were urging people to click browse share to start reading and share the love
5725021 readers are asking us to provide much more author content our proprietary author assistant platform which avon has piloted for harpercollins puts a free tool in the hands of authors to enable them to share more of themselves and their work with their fans
5725022 from search engine optimization to cross marketing were working for our authors who can then focus on writing more of what their fans want
5725023 the second great age of globalization may share the fate of the first
5725024 our grandfathers lived in a world of largely self sufficient inward looking national economies but our great great grandfathers lived as we do in a world of large scale international trade and investment a world destroyed by nationalism
5725025 it does mark the end of the pax americana the era in which the united states more or less maintained a monopoly on the use of military force and that raises some real questions about the future of globalization
5725026 tell us not to worry global economic integration itself protects us against war they argue because successful trading economies wont risk their prosperity by engaging in military adventurism
5725027 f or example war among the nations of western europe really does seem inconceivable now not so much because of economic ties as because of shared democratic values
5725028 much of the world however including nations that play a key role in the global economy doesnt share those values
5725029 the belief that economic rationality always prevents war is an equally great illusion

5725036 fellow countrymen with deep sorrow and grief i would like to inform the people of zambia that our president dr levy patrick mwanawasa died this morning at 1030 hours 0830 gmt
5725037 i also wish to inform the nation that national mourning starts today and will be for seven days
5725038 he showed that he had the courage to speak his own mind about issues that needed to be confronted like zimbabwe
5725039 given the situation in the region losing someone like that is a loss because you need to have people like them and the more the better
5725040 i am sure another captain will be found to steer the ship the good thing is that he taught all of us how to govern this country with integrity
5725041 we will surely find someone wearing the same team shirt and macroeconomic policy will continue the same way economic transformation will continue so we can sustain our political and economic gains
5725042 such testimony and mancusos explosive political revelations were aborted near midnight on may 12 when without warning mr uribe had the auc commander and 13 high level colleagues plucked from detention on the outskirts of medellin and extradited to the us
5725043 the initiative to amend the constitution was flawed by criminal acts
5725044 bellars being injured will give me more of a chance of maybe a start
5725045 thats a good thing from me but hopefully craig will be back soon to strengthen the squad
5725046 it was nice to get out on the pitch in the first game of the season and get a little run out and obviously for the team it was great to get the three points
5725047 weve been waiting for it for so long so it is good to get off the mark
5725048 the expectation surrounding the club is something we are going to have to cope with
5725049 hopefully i will come through okay and will be fit to be involved in the squad
5725050 the pre season went well and i played decently i am not saying i would have been in the team but i wanted to play a part in the first few matches
5725051 when you are experienced you get an inkling of how the manager views his starting line up and i am sure he largely knew his team but it is a squad game and you never know what might happen
5725052 this reminds me of the shepherds way fire in february 2005 in which hundreds of sheep were killed where no arrests were made in the arson
5725053 i wonder if there is any potential relation between the fires second why were they keeping 6 500 pigs in one barn that sounds like a pretty intensive operation that raises its own concerns about humaneness
5725054 was pissed he wanted contreras but didnt bid high enough why else would he force his team to fly to cuba for a day
5725055 to discuss the very troubling granting of a treasury ofac license to a little league team to travel to cuba in august i have included links to two newspaper articles that provide details on the issue
5725056 20 months and three rejections before ofac approved the trip in april
5725057 will lead to a better and more secure world and i believe its through grass roots connections of people to people and baseball teams playing one another that we expand our understanding and thats consistent with the objectives of our initial trips to cuba
5725058 like the idea of the government telling ordinary americans let alone little leaguers where and when they can travel if the president can go to china at taxpayers expense these kids ought to be able to go on a privately paid trip to cuba to play some baseball
5725059 the politics of fear are fuelling a downward spiral of human rights abuses in which no right is sacrosanct and no person safe
5725060 rarely has democracy been so acclaimed yet so breached so promoted yet so disrespected so important yet so disappointing
5725061 arrest need it be said that it is a breaking point in your life a bolt of lightning which has scored a direct hit on you
5725062 we are getting vital information necessary to do our jobs and that is to protect the american people and our allies

5725076 it turned out that when they voted libertarian they thought they were voting for joe lieberman
5725077 the nuns at st genevieves literally beat that into my head by the time i was 7 years old
5725078 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
5725079 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
5725080 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown

5725083 open biomass burning associated with deforestation and crop residue burning
5725084 soot and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the current our italics global warming effect of carbon dioxide
5725085 black carbon particles only remain airborne for weeks at most compared to carbon dioxide which remains in the atmosphere for more than a century
5725086 over 400 000 annual fatalities among women and children are attributed to smoke inhalation during indoor cooking
5725087 i had a regular gig flying aerosmith around for about a month
5725088 i become a senior groupie i really liked those guys
5725089 business wise its like renting space on an empty 18 wheeler after youve dropped off your delivery the advantage to flying a charter is you dont wait in line and at many small airports limousines can drive up to the airplane
5725090 the plane i fly holds 4 500 gallons and jet fuel sells for 7 a gallon on top of that we have about 1 million in fixed costs for the one airplane the faa requires monthly inspections you cant just hang out a shingle and become a charter company
5725091 when you finally get on the plane after waiting in the long line you sit in the center seat for a four hour flight
5725092 the kid in back of you is kicking your seat you get a 5 box of snacks you wouldnt eat if it was free
5725093 and who is sitting next to you you have a discussion with a business associate but you never know who is listening in on the conversation
5725094 there are three groups of people that fly on our aircraft
5725095 you have your high net worth individuals you have the people in the sports and entertainment industry and you have your corporate executives and political figures
5725096 youll never look at commercial flying in quite the same way youll never want to go back to ohare
5725097 youre able to make two or three stops in different cities in one day
5725098 on one of our flights you can get surf and turf sushi shrimp and champagne there is no boundary if you have the means
5725099 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
5725100 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
5725101 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
5725102 i have one more point to make maybe two wait where are you going
5725103 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11

5725108 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5725109 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5725110 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5725111 i need to focus on my re election and he needs to focus on his campaign
5725112 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
5725113 obamas vice presidential choice will show a great deal about how he plans to run the rest of his race and how he will lead if elected
5725114 this choice is especially important since obama has this opportunity to fill a perceived weakness and experience gap with voters this worked well for george bush when he selected dick cheney
5725115 obama can make another type of choice to get elected by selecting a young vibrant running mate to emphasise change this worked for bill clinton with his selection of al gore
5725116 not only are we waging two illegal and immoral wars in afghanistan and iraq but theyre planning on attacking another country iran and we will not let them do that
5725117 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
5725118 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5725119 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5725120 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5725121 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5725122 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5725123 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5725124 but lets suppose it was a different actor or actress i think campaigns are so built to appeal to the majority to 95 percent of the electorate and that runs counter to being funny
5725125 i dont think they want anyone to find out that they have fiction writers writing for them but the worst would be if it got out that the guy who wrote step brothers is writing his material
5725126 if we were to become part of a campaign we would become for better or worse part of large bureaucracies with competing agendas
5725127 youre only here for a short visit dont hurry dont worry and be sure to smell the flowers along the way
5725128 i am pleased to endorse my friend bob tuke to be the next u
5725129 but bob is more than a candidate with timely solutions to pressing problems facing our nation and our planet he is also a man of great honor and integrity bob has the life experience that we need to turn our country around as a marine combat veteran in vietnam bob led troops in battle the u s senate would be well served to have his perspective as we finally bring an end to the mismanaged war in iraq these are just a few of the reasons that i am proud to give him my full support and endorsement
5725130 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5725131 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5725132 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5725133 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5725134 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5725135 there are nuclear weapons materials in more than 40 countries some secured by nothing more than a chain link fence and at the current pace it will be decades before this material is adequately secured
5725136 the worlds second largest muslim nation could become a failed state with an arsenal of nuclear weapons and a population larger than those of iran iraq afghanistan and north korea combined
5725137 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5725138 they told me there are going to be resources here
5725139 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5725140 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5725141 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5725142 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5725143 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5725144 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5725145 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5725146 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
5725147 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
5725148 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
5725149 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
5725150 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
5725151 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
5725152 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
5725153 since focused on his environmental crusade winning an oscar for his documentary an inconvenient truth as well as the 2007 nobel peace prize on thursday he proposed a bol
5725154 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5725155 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
5725156 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5725157 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5725158 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
5725159 i tell people its not a wind farm its an industrial development
5725160 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
5725161 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
5725162 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
5725163 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5725164 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5725165 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5725166 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5725167 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5725168 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5725169 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5725170 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5725171 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5725172 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5725173 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it
5725174 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5725175 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5725176 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5725177 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5725178 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5725179 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5725180 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5725181 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
5725182 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
5725183 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
5725184 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
5725185 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
5725186 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
5725187 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
5725188 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
5725189 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
5725190 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
5725191 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5725192 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5725193 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5725194 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5725195 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5725196 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5725197 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5725198 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5725199 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5725200 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5725201 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5725202 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5725203 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5725204 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5725205 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5725206 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5725207 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5725208 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5725209 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5725210 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5725211 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5725212 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5725213 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5725214 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5725215 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5725216 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5725217 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5725218 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5725219 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5725220 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5725221 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5725222 on the big issues that our nation faces some sacrifice will be required not only from you individually but from the nation as a whole there is no magic bullet to our energy problems for example no perfect energy source
5725223 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5725224 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5725225 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5725226 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5725227 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5725228 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5725229 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5725230 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5725231 the israelis have claimed for years that iranian uranium enrichment efforts are the first steps toward the development of a nuclear weapon a weapon they believe may be used on the jewish state
5725232 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
5725233 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
5725234 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
5725235 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
5725236 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
5725237 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
5725238 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
5725239 what do you want your look to say to people
5725240 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
5725241 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
5725242 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
5725243 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
5725244 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
5725245 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
5725246 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
5725247 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
5725248 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
5725249 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
5725250 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
5725251 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
5725252 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
5725253 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
5725254 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
5725255 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
5725256 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
5725257 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5725258 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5725259 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5725260 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5725261 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5725262 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5725263 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5725264 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5725265 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5725266 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5725267 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5725268 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5725269 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5725270 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5725271 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5725272 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5725273 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5725274 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5725275 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5725276 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5725277 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5725278 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5725279 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5725280 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5725281 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5725282 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5725283 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5725284 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5725285 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5725286 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5725287 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5725288 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5725289 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5725290 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5725291 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5725292 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5725293 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
5725294 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5725295 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5725296 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5725297 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5725298 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
5725299 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
5725300 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5725301 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5725302 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5725303 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5725304 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5725305 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
5725306 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
5725307 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
5725308 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
5725309 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
5725310 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5725311 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5725312 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5725313 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5725314 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5725315 uranium mining has taken our country away from us and destroyed it mining and the millions of dollars in royalties have not improved our quality of life
5725316 the greatest minds in the nuclear establishment have been searching for an answer to the radioactive waste problem for fifty years and theyve finally got one haul it down a dirt road and dump it on an indian reservation
5725317 for eight years in the white house every weapons proliferation problem we dealt with was connected to a civilian reactor program and if we ever got to the point where we wanted to use nuclear reactors to back out a lot of coal then wed have to put them in so many places wed run that proliferation risk right off the reasonability scale

5725320 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
5725321 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
5725322 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
5725323 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
5725324 our early start means were not facing the same compliance costs others in the sector are facing under the national greenhouse and energy reporting act
5725325 instead were focusing on the commercial opportunities for us rather than dealing with the compliance costs
5725326 were well positioned to make money from carbon markets which is simply an extension of our energy trading business
5725327 we have a solid understanding of the market and how to help our customers
5725328 the train has left the station on this and there will be severe repercussions for those who fail to see the inevitable coming
5725329 no one says its easy but carbon will have to be managed as just another business issue
5725330 we understood what it meant to measure our carbon footprint it was extremely difficult to get landlords to change their behaviour
5725331 we ended up spending the money ourselves to install sensors in offices change our light bulbs and employ our own cleaners so we could recycle
5725332 it was also a challenge convincing suppliers that we were serious about the carbon impact of production processes in our purchasing decisions
5725333 we made a conscious decision to pay more for more efficiently produced consumables and to include the long term carbon impact in equipment running costs
5725334 tnt has the largest fleet of diesel electric vehicles in australia we bought the whole production line from japan of 10 vehicles last year but we have 1500 trucks in our fleet
5725335 so its going to be some time before our suppliers can produce enough trucks to satisfy the demand
5725336 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
5725337 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
5725338 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5725339 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5725340 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5725341 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5725342 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5725343 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5725344 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5725345 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5725346 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5725347 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5725348 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5725349 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5725350 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5725351 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5725352 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5725353 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5725354 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5725355 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5725356 billofrights can you not see the irony that you use the phrase
5725357 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
5725358 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
5725359 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
5725360 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
5725361 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
5725362 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
5725363 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
5725364 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
5725365 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5725366 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5725367 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5725368 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5725369 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5725370 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5725371 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5725372 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5725373 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5725374 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5725375 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability

5725377 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5725378 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5725379 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5725380 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5725381 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5725382 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5725383 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
5725384 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
5725385 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up
5725386 since i run a small computer repair business of my own i have a handful of guys working with me and i always stress to them that i want happy customers first through decent work and second by never making the customer feel stupid even if the customer made a mistake or did something stupid
5725387 although i like to think im practicing a little buddhist or socialist right livelihood here its also sound capitalism since happy customers not only come back they tell other people that your work was good and you treated them well and so they bring you more customers
5725388 we print critiques of obama all the time and dont have to go into your hyperbole
5725389 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5725390 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5725391 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5725392 desde hace un mes nos retiramos de la mesa de negociaci n con el gobierno distrital porque nos hicieron firmar un documento y dijeron que en tres meses se iban a dar soluciones ese tiempo ya pas y hasta ahora no hemos visto que resuelvan nada
5725393 es la menos llamada a hacer ese trabajo porque es la misma que nos quit los cupos para prestar el servicio en bogot
5725394 no vamos a permitir que se vuelva a colapsar la ciudad
5725395 estamos trabajando de la mano con las secretar as de gobierno y movilidad y hasta ahora no hay motivos para ir a un paro
5725396 se viene trabajando seg n lo que se ha acordado
5725397 the plan was to have simon still playing in september
5725398 ich bin gl cklich damit und hebe mir noch etwas auf f r london wenn es da klappt ist gut und wenn nicht habe ich wenigstens einmal in meinem leben bronze gewonnen bei olympischen spielen
5725399 ganz ehrlich das war einfach nicht meine woche an dem ding
5725400 den fabian hat ausgezeichnet dass er die ohren nicht hat h ngen lassen wenn es mal nicht so lief andere machen fehler und bauen dann ganz ab
5725401 das war gar nicht so viel aber ich musste langsam sprechen damit er es versteht
5725402 wenn da nur eine kleinigkeit dazwischenkommt kann eine wunderbare vorbereitung kurzfristig kaputtgehen
5725403 aber wenn man sich dann so darauf fixiert dass man sich im ersten moment gar nicht ber bronze freuen kann muss man sich echt berlegen was man da die letzten tage und monate gemacht hat
5725404 nadie puede sentirse orgulloso de esa parte de la historia del reino unido en ir n
5725405 desgraciadamente la presencia brit nica en aquellos a os de las compa as petroleras anglo persian y anglo iranian result desastrosa para ir n
5725406 nos encantar a poder satisfacer las necesidades de energ a de europa siempre y cuando ste fuera un trato a dos bandas en algunos casos ser a de alguna ayuda el intercambio de informaci n cient fica el conocimiento de expertos
5725407 si no qui n a va a resultar m s perjudicado no me cabe duda que el nivel de vida de muchos pa ses europeos se va a ver afectado a largo plazo cuando no tengan suficientes recursos energ ticos
5725408 uno se encuentra con que muchos miembros de la elite iran aseguran que el petr leo ha sido para nosotros hist ricamente una maldici n debido a que ha impedido el desarrollo econ mico en general de nuestro pa s ha socavado el desarrollo pol tico y social
5725409 en lo que a m respecta no estoy seguro de que ir n sin todo ese petr leo habr a sido muy diferente un ir n sin petr leo habr a tenido que echar mano a muchos otros recursos y desarrollarlos
5725410 hurriyat leaders who have been demanding secession from the country were not only provided vip treatment by the state government on the directions of vohra but he also facilitated their meeting with a un observor
5725411 it is shocking that with the support of the state government the delegation of hurriyat conference submitted a memorandum in which secession from india is demanded
5725412 it is with deep sorrow that i have to tell the people of zambia that our president has passed away this morning
5725413 one day i asked him papa why dont you leave this politics you always wanted to become a pilot he said no i never thought of leaving it because i believe in the people of india
5725414 we however find from experience and observation that the re forestation or afforestation that is being carried out in india does not meet the fundamentals and the planting of new trees to match the numbers removed is too simplistic and archaic a solution
5725415 in the guise of compensatory replantation local varieties of trees are being replaced by alien and non indigenous but fast growing varieties such as popular and eucalyptus which make up the numbers but cannot satisfy the needs of our environmental system
5725416 it must be borne in mind that both re forestation and afforestation envisage a resurrection and re plantation of trees and other flora similar to those which have been removed and which are suitable to the area in question
5725417 if you take this into account the transport emissions are even smaller less than one tenth of the overall amount of co2 saved by recycling
5725418 the growth in exports is in part a success story reflecting the rapid development of the uks collection infrastructure and increase in recovery rates exports to china are bridging the gap between plastic bottle collections being established and the future development of domestic reprocessing capacity
5725419 it may seem strange that transporting our unwanted paper and plastic bottles such a distance would actually be better for the environment but that is what the evidence from this study shows
5725420 we do not have a manufacturing base here ideally it would be dealt with here but we would far prefer to see it recycled in china where it is a resource than landfilled in britain
5725421 in todays times not a lot of people make it 25 years and you have something special to celebrate
5725422 businesses are taking steps to make their it operations more dynamic and are delving into virtualization as a cornerstone strategy
5725423 microsoft recognises this and is innovating its licensing policies product support and a wide range of it solutions to help customers get virtual now
5725424 i dont need any extra motivation my motivation is to win
5725425 im very proud of my area around the plate i dont want anyone messing with my dirt
5725426 its a yankee world were just falling apart in it
5725427 i think it is too little too late for the yankees to make the playoffs
5725428 he broke a record every time he went into the water
5725429 he won eight gold medals all on heart ability and courage
5725430 it was really close when i saw photo finish i was on pins and needles i didnt know what happened
5725431 all of us just went for that line it was an intense race and i came through and got the third so im very pleased
5725432 she might even rival myleene klass as the best bikini babe on the show
5725433 i said all along i support drilling but not allowing the oil companies carte blanche
5725434 shes failed to tell you that shes taken thousands of dollars from oil companies as a matter of fact she took money from enron
5725435 lets compare 5 000 from enron before there was a scandal to the 230 000 that jon has taken from the oil companies
5725436 i believe i was the first one who mentioned talking to the generals
5725437 we have built 355 miles of a wall we need to finish the job so we can secure our homeland
5725438 jon youve been there for six years and nothing has been accomplished
5725439 glen was about to sign a contract with leyton orient but one day he was walking the streets saw a fight went over to help got stabbed in the back and was paralysed
5725440 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and his family go through you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again
5725441 we have got to help it is something that as footballers and people and as a team we can get involved in we have got a voice that kids listen to and we believe that things can change
5725442 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
5725443 i said what are you doing in my house he just kept saying he didnt do it
5725444 every year congress says a long term solution is needed
5725445 i would say this will be the number one thing on the agenda of the new congress and the new president
5725446 i think the country understands now is the time to do this
5725447 if you want better outcomes better safety better service why dont you pay for it
5725448 what you need to do is just dont cut the good ones the message that sent would have begun to change the whole country overnight
5725449 what denis has said is very persuasive congress would love this but basically i say to you its a cop out
5725450 series of simon amp schuster authors including michael moore alexandra pelosi and paul begala
5725451 threshold has absolutely nothing to do with the people at simon amp schuster who have published hillary clintons books
5725452 i was surprised that i could be asked that question
5725453 i thought the injuries were so obvious i guess i was disgusted
5725454 as a parent if i saw these things on my child i would look to see if there were more
5725455 clarks essentially a good person and deep down im not

5725457 saya tidak pernah marah secara individu kepada rekan setim karena kami gagal mengangkat trofi kami semua menanggungnya bersama sama kami menang sebagai tim dan kalah juga sebagai sebuah tim

5725466 muitos professores pedem para perguntar aos pais quando ir o voltar ao brasil dependendo da resposta direcionam a orienta o eu pessoalmente acho que as crian as devem ser preparadas a receber educa o formal e se formar mesmo se forem embora de volta ao brasil ou para outra escola pelo menos j ter o estudado j ter o forma o b sica outra ponta de desmotiva o vem da fam lia sinto que muitos pais matriculam os filhos na escola como se fosse um local para deixar a crian a uma creche enquanto trabalham durante o dia eu pessoalmente acho que a escola local para receber educa o formal e n o uma creche onde se pode colocar e tirar a crian a a bel prazer a crian a mesmo sendo estrangeira tem o direito de estudar fazer parte da escola e isto nem os pais e nem as crian as sentem de verdade

5725471 i continue to be concerned about the tri border area between argentina brazil and paraguay
5725472 it is in my view principally hezbollah activity there is clearly fund raising money laundering drug trafficking and certainly a portion of the funds that are raised in that are making their way back to the middle east
5725473 so far in his interrogation he has confessed to his involvement in the ahmedabad blasts
5725474 though bashr is cooperating in interrogation he is not revealing much details he is just giving short replies to the questions asked by the officials most of his replies are in yes and nos
5725475 they are also key conspirators who designed and planned the terror attacks in ahmedabad they may also be involved in jaipur and hyderabad blasts

5725478 this is the most serious foreign policy crisis ever faced by the head of the german government
5725479 now it is important that merkel of the conservative christian democrats the cdu and german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier of merkels coalition partners the left leaning social democrats the spd show their mettle as a duo the two politicians have had an edgy relationship marred by differences of opinion and jabs in many areas to make matters worse an election campaign is looming on the horizon in which steinmeier will likely run as merkels main opponent but right now germany cannot afford any partisan squabbling in its foreign policy
5725480 new rail road is only new in name there is nothing really new about it i cant take out my own vehicle because it takes a beating on this road going out with family is a thing of the past now
5725481 we have to be very careful when it rains some times we fall on the roads its not just this sector 9 patroli chowk all are bad
5725482 just cant go through this stretch it takes half an hour to cover a distance which should take only 5 minutes i have to leave before 8 now that the number of cars on the road are growing its a menace it could cause accidents especially in the morning when everyones in a rush and the call centre drivers go berserk on the road

5725486 little camas reservoir in elmore county will be dry or nearly dry by late summer fish in the reservoir will have a high likelihood of dieing as water levels drop for these reasons the idaho department of fish and game opened the reservoir to salvage of fish
5725487 we would rather have people harvest these fish than let them go to waste when the reservoir is dewatered
5725488 daily bag possession and size limits will be removed on little camas reservoir beginning aug 20 and ending nov 30
5725489 we had a great spring and i have really been looking forward to this season
5725490 this is a team that has the mentality that they expect to win they are not only interested in having a winning season they want to win the conference and make the ncaa tournament and then win games in the ncaa tournament
5725491 it started in the spring they came out and worked hard at practice when we didnt have practice they worked hard on their own as a team
5725492 we have more forwards this year then weve ever had on the squad
5725493 weve got six girls more really who could play up front for us there is going to be some fierce competition for some starting positions the exciting thing is were going to have depth that we havent had in a long time
5725494 the difference between our starters and the next couple off the bench is so close
5725495 that goes for our forwards as well as midfielders its going to increase competition and the work rate in practices that will make us better we will be able to sub this year in multiple positions without the level of play dropping its great
5725496 the back line is a little more open so early on were going to try and play a lot people in a lot of different positions so we can see as many combinations as possible
5725497 we have the numbers to do a lot more things this year i see the positives and potential
5725498 meghan and catherine are both great keepers and i am confident with either one of them on the field
5725499 more importantly the teams confidence level is very high in both their goalkeepers that is so important both will do another great job for the team
5725500 i got into the rock star mentality and i took it way too far
5725501 thats kind of my secret to my whole thing it stays fun
5725502 if you just sit around and train in the summer because youre going to be the best snowboarder in the winter and thats all youre thinking about its not good

5725545 a few months ago i rode the bus and max to a blazer game from tigard two weeks previously i was hit by an suv and sustained a concussion broken ankle and many bruises when i got on the bus it was full i did my best to balance on one leg without dropping my crutches but im very short so i couldnt reach the rail everyone conveniently looked down at their ipod or phone and pretended not to notice me at the max station the train was already there so i had to try and rush to get to it before it departed there were plenty of seats and i was glad to be able to sit after about 20 minutes of sitting the driver announced this train would not be departing and that another train would come on the other track i got off the train and went to the other track to wait the train that came was even more crowded than the bus by this time i was exhausted from hobbling around on crutches i stood in the entry way and tried to get close enough to a pole to hold onto but it was too crowded there was a little boy looking over the back of his seat by me his father sitting next to him i asked him if he wanted to sit on his dads lap and let me sit in his seat he shook his head slowly then turned back around his father looked up and shrugged it was a long ride over an hour altogether of balancing on one foot while more and more people pressed against my cast as the train filled to capacity it makes me sad to think that people just dont care

5725710 a shepherd looks at psalm 23 by phillip keller we have read this book many times it is written by an experienced shepherd that became a pastor we highly recommend this book this is a thought that encouraged us
5725711 a point worthy of mention here is that whenever the shepherd opens a gate into fresh pasture the sheep are filled with excitement as they go through the gate even the staid old ewes will often kick up their heels and leap with delight at the prospect of finding fresh feed how they enjoy being led onto new ground god wants us all to move on with him he wants us to walk with him he wants it not only for our welfare but for the benefit of others as well as his own dear reputation perhaps there are those who think he expects too much of us maybe they feel the demands are too drastic some may even consider his call impossible to carry out it would be if we had to depend on self determination or self discipline to succeed but if we are in earnest about wanting to do his will and to be led he makes this possible by his own gracious spirit who is given to those who obey acts 5 32 for it is he who works in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure philippians 2 13

5725735 theyd just read the news that the authorities in bihar one of indias poorest states were encouraging people to eat rats in an effort to beat the food shortages
5725736 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic
5725737 sign on young man and sail with me the stature of our homeland is no more than the measure of ourselves our job is to keep her free our will is to keep the torch of freedom burning for all to this solemn purpose we call on the young the brave the strong and the free heed my call come to the sea come sail with me

5725743 over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be taken are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge
5725744 he resigned himself and as far as his accountability is concerned coalition partners will decide
5725745 theres no stable settlement these two guys sharif and zardari will now start slugging it out
5725746 we hope that north korea gives us concrete results by the fall

5725749 japan needs to prepare for an atmosphere in which they offer energy support if there is progress on the abduction issue
5725750 the tests intended objectives were not met to say the least
5725751 we dont want to be in a situation where we are in some kind of frozen relationship with russia but until russia pulls its forces out of georgia and respects international norms of the 21st century we just cant go on with business as usual
5725752 we will reaffirm the commitment in bucharest and the meeting is also expected to approve a package of measures to support georgia
5725753 i think the allies are going to be firm that this was a violation of georgias territorial integrity
5725754 despite their love for all things kinky and naughty it is illegal in japan to show any private parts in japanese porn boykakke producer dannyz said
5725755 there are literally thousands of gay japanese dvds for sale on the market
5725756 but all have blurred mosaics around the genitals which is a total turn off for most consumers as you can probably imagine the pent up demand is huge for uncensored japanese porn which is exactly why this title will fly from the shelves
5725757 not only is the title uncensored japanese its also the same top shelf quality consumers have come to expect from the line
5725758 preorders have been off the chart for this film as weve sold more of this already in pre books than we did their first film in the first month showing that theyre really starting to build an audience thats looking for more of this line

5725764 it was a time of extreme free spending and following that crash so there have been several years where it departments have been subject to extreme discretion of their spending habits and had to justify every purchase they made
5725765 so i would say they are the one department that can say been there done that when it comes to careful examination of spending
5725766 people have not been overspending on it and thus it is not the juiciest place to cut right now
5725767 that confidence is underwritten by a lot of factors like will the difficulties in the credit market be sorted out in a reasonable amount of time

5725982 en ce temps l j sus vint de nazareth en galil e et il fut baptis par jean dans le jourdain au moment o il sortait de leau il vit les cieux souvrir et lesprit descendre sur lui comme une colombe et une voix fit entendre des cieux ces paroles tu es mon fils bien aim en toi jai mis toute mon affection

5725991 im really disappointed with how the season has turned out and although i managed a podium early in the year the majority of the results havent what id hoped for the tt has to be the biggest disappointment of my career so far and since then its been a real struggle to keep everything on track its been a very unsettling time for me which has made it difficult to stay focused on the racing side of things but ive kept my head down and have worked as hard as i could unfortunately our fortunes havent improved and it just hasnt worked out so weve made the decision to part company with immediate effect id like to complete the season and end the year in the top ten of the superstock championship but at this moment in time i have nothing on the table so will be sitting on the sidelines until that situation changes
5725992 after some consideration on how best to honour and acknowledge the riders we thought this would be a fitting tribute cadwell park apart from the awesome racing is also now remembered for the cjrf charity cycle race the evening before the race day a lot of fun is had by the riders and at least they have the opportunity to try to relax and enjoy the atmosphere this bike race produces along with the crowds participation which always makes this event a memorable one we are hoping this will raise the profile even further for the cjrf in its continuing hard work raising money for all riders safety now and in the future our own riders have had to use the mobile x ray machine purchased by the cjrf fund and it has already proven its worth on many occasions this season already
5725993 inflation is more systemic than they were leading us to believe in the past numbers and it will continue to show up in the cpi number for months to come the question is whether or not investors can shake it off knowing that the price of oil has come down
5725994 the fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place and it shows
5725995 this shows we are different from an old age mining company
5725996 this is going to raise the bar for mining in idaho
5725997 we do not want to be responsible just because something shows up in the creek
5725998 any time they will pony up for conservation projects is good
5725999 we want to be part of the solution but we want to make sure it is practical and implementable and doesnt put a burden on one part of entire industry just because it is most easily found
5726000 we are doing it early and trying to get everyone retrofitted before next ozone season because the next season will be critical
5726001 like most organizations conner strong has information in separate data silos including sales marketing customer service and financial databases
5726002 utilizing our customer data integration solution we are now able to use all of our data assets in an integrated manner to help up sell cross sell and overall better manage of our business
5726003 attendees of this session will learn how conner strong integrated their various data sources and how it has benefited them
5726004 if you remove a school bus from the road youre adding 40 to 50 cars in the morning and in the afternoon
5726005 are you going to walk a half mile down the street to cross in the appropriate way when you see a clear way right there
5726006 its sort of an indiana jones effort to find out what weve got coming out of the sewers and into the river
5726007 we dont know what the source of flame retardants is in the spokane river
5726008 people dont realize it but tires are 1 percent zinc
5726009 when we know which ones are the hottest well start working our way up the pipe
5726010 we dont really have a lot of wiggle room in terms of annual budget
5726011 weve fared relatively well in comparison to other agencies and departments
5726012 our salaries and fuel and so forth thats about 86 percent of the total budget like i said theres not a lot of wiggle room
5726013 glacier has been the hidden gem of the national park service for a long time
5726014 we definitely havent been able to capture all our fuel costs
5726015 every time we have a vacancy we review it carefully do we really need this position
5726016 we think we might be in line for funding in 2010 or 2011
5726017 you try to focus on the things that present the most hazard
5726018 beyond that theres just so much its hard for me to be specific its a notebook full a big three ringed binder
5726019 but its hard to know because prices have gone up so much in the last two years
5726020 divide six into 400 million and thats how long its going to take to fix everything that needs fixing in this park
5726021 but its an avenue the biggest problem is we have to compete every year so its hard to know what the future holds
5726022 the reason for closures varies it can depend on the community resources how many volunteers are available or if they have support from local organizations
5726023 in some cases were having to cut back on the amount of food were putting in boxes because theres more people coming
5726024 the answer is either opening for more hours or finding additional food pantries
5726025 there are definitely instances when pantries close for one reason or another but then we seek others to come in their place
5726026 this is part of a broad campaign by the nra to get guns into all our public places
5726027 it is hard to view this proposed change as anything more than an election year gimmick directed at the nra and the sportsmens community
5726028 weve got bigger issues facing our parks than accommodating a relative handful of people who want to carry a concealed firearm
5726029 we dont think people should forfeit that right when they go for a hike in the woods
5726030 if we are talking handguns youd need a pretty good sized piece to stop a bear
5726031 i dont picture a hiker packing a 44 magnum these are people who drill holes in their toothbrushes to save weight
5726032 our organization is not opposed to gun ownership and people carrying weapons
5726033 but we just dont feel they are necessary in national parks
5726034 i am a retired police officer retired navy masterchief and a grandfather
5726035 i am too old to run and too big to hide i have a concealed carry permit in my state therefore i keep a gun nearby to protect myself and family
5726036 i find it horribly ironic and paradoxical that at the same time we are struggling with energy independence that the congress and the current administration cant solve this issue
5726037 wieder die fahrg ste schr pfen um den geplanten b rsengang f r profithungrige investoren attraktiv zu machen
5726038 most of us are seeing slightly slower growth but were still seeing growth
5726039 the public has no idea whether those studies have been submitted to the epa or not and if so what they show maybe they never came in maybe they came in and they show a real problem for bees maybe theyre poorly conducted studies that dont satisfy epas requirement
5726040 weve been monitoring the bee die off situation for a couple of years and its a complex puzzle that may also involve mites viruses and other factors
5726041 we want this information now we cannot continue to wait bees are disappearing our whole existence depends on them because we eat the flowers need to be pollinated and the only ones to do it are the bees
5726042 we advocated that rather than more information on the sidewall better the information be required at the point of sale
5726043 right now that tire efficiency data is not widely available
5726044 cost effective for consumers and the nation to reduce oil use
5726045 what weve done in the past with fuel breaks seemed to be the right thing at the time
5726046 a lot of our concern is trying to break up the continuity of fuels on the surface and those that go up into the crown of larger trees those are referred to as ladder fuels in some cases just cutting seven inch trees would not break up that continuous fuel path
5726047 no significant increased delivery of sediment to reeder reservoir over that which would occur naturally is allowed
5726048 theres a lot of agreement between the city the forest service and the community perhaps more than theres ever been
5726049 the forest service will move forward with or without us we need to stay on board and maintain a collaborative relationship
5726050 its my hope all these projects are going to go over the next few years
5726051 the people here work in the mills log the forests and drive the trucks what is going to happen when those jobs vanish
5726052 theres always going to be some impact but we think it can be mitigated
5726053 there is a huge snow pack there with an average annual snowfall of 1 100 centimetres and its just two hours from the lower mainland
5726054 weve talked to the city of merritt and the province and believe there is opportunity there that can be a win for everyone
5726055 now its not what you would call a pretty stream
5726056 but in the end it will be beautified and that will be a benefit to the members we want to help in making it a workable stream
5726057 thats the magic moment when you get to connect two different worlds
5726058 many locals never dreamed someone in the us would care enough to come here
5726059 a lot of them dont know how to manage people throw in a whole other culture socioeconomic class language they didnt know what to do
5726060 for some you have to pull about 14 teeth to get them out of there
5726061 it is hard to be separated but when the americans come it makes us feel like we are with them
5726062 its interesting to see where people come from so you can relate better
5726063 when we come back it makes them want to work for us
5726064 my motivation was we dont have to make all the same mistakes of the past
5726065 having them on dairy farms is new i thought so lets start from the beginning
5726066 one of my employees unbeknownst to me was building a bakery back home
5726067 i had no idea when i walked into his village that first evening i was beside myself i could have been helping him to be a business person
5726068 were the only industry of this size and scope that doesnt have a real voice in this process at best were humored at worst were ignored
5726069 is it making our community stronger or are we trapped in that model
5726070 the philanthropic dollars provide us the money to experiment and try new things
5726071 philanthropy can fail in a way that government cant but we can catalyze government investment in growing what works
5726072 there are a lot of people in this sector who will get nervous about the federal government becoming too engaged in philanthropy
5726073 but theres also this other argument that we dont want an agency that is going to over regulate us
5726074 so theyre just growing until they reach about five milimeters and then they get planted out in the wild
5726075 at that time we really didnt know what the problem was in 2005 we did quite a lot of tests and so we were kind of scratching our heads as to what was causing the problem
5726076 we werent at the time monitoring for vibrio tubiashii in our waters you were not we were not because we didnt think it was going to be a problem because historically we had not had that kind of problem here
5726077 my feeling is that we really need to get some of the range of scientific disciplines involved so that we know with certainty what kind of changes are happening we dont have enough monitoring in the ocean environment to understand when a change is important and when it is part of the background cycle
5726078 this is dabob bay and i am looking at a little white buoy about almost one quarter mile off the beach here and thats where our intake line is about 110 feet
5726079 were going to sample ph right at the intake line
5726080 its really difficult to know what is going on but it is disturbing its reaching a point where we are seeing something that we have never seen before and at the level that weve never seen before and its very disturbing
5726081 its going to hopefully save the oyster industry as a whole because if we lost our commercial hatcheries the whole oyster industry here on the west coast would fall apart and that would be a tragedy
5726082 i think other municipalities will be very encouraged by londons leadership
5726083 already many are looking at this issue and im sure many others will
5726084 to us its a matter of choice and a matter of personal preference
5726085 bottled water companies have had a fabulous ride on an unnecessary fad
5726086 is the lead authority within the un system looking at issues of environment and sustainability of our resources on the planet
5726087 we translate that into policy advice for transforming our economies into greener economies
5726088 meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
5726089 sustainability presents a path forward that allows humanity to meet current environmental and human health economic and societal needs without compromising the progress and success of future generations
5726090 has an ongoing obligation to ensure that the benefits arising from its products processes and services are not unduly compromised by inherent hazards or harmful practices
5726091 sustainability begins with the premise that environmental responsibility is everyones responsibility
5726092 is shifting to what id refer to as a green culture
5726093 whether you are on wall street or on main street were seeing people are changing the way they think and the way they act in regard to environmental protection and everyone is now working toward and sees the need of becoming a more sustainable society
5726094 the key is its not one or the other it has to be both
5726095 also the women who are having children are having fewer children
5726096 a lot of it is delayed marriage and women getting started a little bit later in life
5726097 there are significant numbers of women in the u s who would choose a career over having a child married or unmarried
5726098 the black population is staying about the same and the white and asian populations are declining theyre not replacing themselves so the population is growing more diverse
5726099 what that shows is that women are finishing their degrees and having a baby right away
5726100 overall women with higher education levels have lower levels of lifetime fertility
5726101 you have to scale back on everything in order to make ends meet
5726102 some of these child care centers are precariously close to closing their doors

5726171 i turned to my dad and said dad we got the same score he looked up and said oh yeah we started getting a little confused

5726218 gwen is not seen as being any less important a moderator or having less important an assignment than any other moderator
5726219 truth be told even i would say there are not a lot of women on the level of the brokaws and the schieffers

5726237 the public has no idea whether those studies have been submitted to the epa or not and if so what they show maybe they never came in maybe they came in and they show a real problem for bees maybe theyre poorly conducted studies that dont satisfy epas requirement
5726238 weve been monitoring the bee die off situation for a couple of years and its a complex puzzle that may also involve mites viruses and other factors
5726239 we want this information now we cannot continue to wait bees are disappearing our whole existence depends on them because we eat the flowers need to be pollinated and the only ones to do it are the bees
5726240 in our view any house member who goes to a party that honors a member or a group of members is violating the ethics rules
5726241 its a violation of the spirit the language and the meaning of the provisions
5726242 these are all the same people who have a big lobbying presence in d c and they all have major issues before congress and the executive branch

5726260 some insurance company sipps can operate by paying a quite substantial commission upfront which is deducted from the customers investment fund
5726261 but this is generally done by agreement between the customer and the adviser
5726262 advice given to transfer into a sipp is suitable reflects the customers needs priorities and circumstances and is not influenced by commission payments

5726279 the united states has long held that each separatist conflict anywhere in the world is unique indeed the situation in kosovo is a special case and does not serve as a precedent for other regions including the abkhazia and south ossetia regions of georgia

5726295 apocrypha that is books which are not regarded as equal to the holy scriputres and yet are profitable and good to read
5726296 as to the apocriphe bookes i omit them because i am no papist as i said before
5726297 as the church reads the books of judith and tobit and maccabees but does not receive them among the canonical scriptures so also it reads wisdom and ecclesiasticus for the edification of the people not for the authoritative confirmation of doctrine

5726349 comrades heh this is an election about hope and change no longer will the established forces of insider cronyism be pulling the strings in washington dc no longer will the dick cheneys of the world be given free reign to implement the policy agenda of their corporate masters under the presumed authority of ther highest office in the land where others fail to lead i will i announce that if elected i will eliminate for all practical purposes the office of the vice president he will continue to serve his constitutionally mandates role as president of the senate and he will continue to enjoy the traditional accoutrements of that office but there will be no shadow administration in an obama white house like there is in the bush mccain white house his staff his office space the funding for that office all gone instead my vice president will also serve as secretary of state he will be accountable to me but most of all you need not fear that the resources available to the office of the vice presidency will be used to enrich the oil companies blah blah blah

5726355 the combination of weaker growth and higher inflation suggests that the voting could be split three ways again at the august meeting

5726419 the population of the country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
5726420 older people with any physical vulnerability are about 13 percent more likely than those without one to report verbal mistreatment but are not more likely to report financial mistreatment
5726421 perhaps the respondents are including fairly routine arguments perhaps about money with their spouse sibling or child in their reports or perhaps older adults are more reticent to report negative behavior

5726426 sports can be a great way for young people to get the exercise they need while also developing social skills and having fun

5726428 its okay to have a life and to help someone else to have one too

5726430 having said that the conclusion i argue for is a more demanding one than most of us manage to live up to it looks at the difference between what really makes a life better and the sorts of luxuries we might spend money and time on
5726431 can we seriously put our hands on our hearts and say my life has been made better for having spent this money on myself theres a point at which it becomes pretty difficult to defend spending resources on yourself rather than making a monetary sacrifice such as to an aid agency that wont leave you any worse off in the long term but will help other people very significantly
5726432 the serious question weve got to ask ourselves is how much worse off would i really be if i put my hand in my pocket and helped other people for most of us the answer is not significantly if at all
5726433 i am going to give the money away it would be the height of hypocrisy to write a book on this topic and then to pocket a healthy check and spend all of that on myself
5726434 the award is designed to help draw attention to issues of significant ethical importance and im pleased that it will give people an opportunity to discuss and debate this particular issue more broadly

5726470 business requirements budget pressures and rapid growth in corporate data volumes are forcing medium size organizations to take a serious look at sophisticated it infrastructure solutions
5726471 previous esg research conducted in 2004 found that more than one third 39 of medium size organizations reported corporate storage requirements of 1 terabyte tb of data or less with just 13 reporting more than 10 tb of data today those figures have reversed just 9 say they have 1 tb of data or less while 42 now report having 10 tb or more this situation is driving strong demand for a number of information management technologies including networked storage digital archiving and data reduction not to mention increased information security
5726472 survey participants indicate service and support capabilities provided by vendors and or their channel partners are now their number one it infrastructure selection criteria playing a greater role in the purchasing process than price or ongoing operating costs

5726488 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations currently autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5726489 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5726490 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
5726491 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that

5726942 it is with deep sorrow that i have to tell the people of zambia that our president has passed away this morning
5726943 the peace we currently enjoy should not be taken for granted

5726945 you people in the west redeem yourself before you begin attacking china

5726948 he left our prison early this morning and he is now already far from here
5726949 gary glitter is a persistent offender responsible for a catalogue of sexual crimes against children
5726950 so called sex tourists move around the world and target countries they know have weak or non existent child protection systems such as cambodia or vietnam
5726951 we know about glitter because of his fame but there are many other sex offenders not in the public eye who are falling off the radar
5726952 were like two children on the playground of the unconfessed souls abandoned by our mothers and our lovers and our foes
5726953 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness

5726968 some of the big carriers tout their ptt services but they have the carrier barrier limitation of locking their customers into their networks and only the handsets the carriers support

5726970 mr stewart the fake news anchor came in at no 4 tied with the real news anchors brian williams and tom brokaw of nbc dan rather of cbs and anderson cooper of cnn

5726972 see this desk it folds up at the end of the day and i take it home in my purse
5726973 but in a year when 60 minutes wednesday edition broke the abu ghraib story to say that the outstanding achievement in news and information is a comedy program which by stewarts own admission is just for fun makes things up i suppose its some kind of message to the news people

5726988 ash for the purification ceremonies is regarded as the basis of ritual life
5726989 are essentially the rites proper to the tending of a domestic fire for the temple fire is that of the hearth fire raised to a new solemnity
5726990 who sacrifices unto fire with fuel in his hand is given happiness
5726991 no actual ruins of a fire temple have been identified from before the parthian period
5726992 all those for whom it cooks the evening and morning meal
5726993 it seems probable that there were virtually only two namely the atash i vahram literally
5726994 the prosaic nature of the middle persian names kadag man and xanag are all words for an ordinary house perhaps reflect a desire on the part of those who fostered the temple cult to keep it as close as possible in character to the age old cult of the hearth fire and to discourage elaboration
5726995 on a number of sites the gombad made usually of rubble masonry with courses of stone is all that survives and so such ruins are popularly called in fars ah r t q or four arches
5726996 the fire which is farnbag has made its place among the priests the fire which is g shnasp has made its place among the warriors the fire which is b rz n mitr has made its place among agriculturists
5726997 the one burning in paradise in the presence of ohrmazd

5727004 in these experiments we are asking a very fundamental question how can we better understand the detailed properties of neutrinos
5727005 in order to understand neutrino mixing and oscillations we must know the value of the unknown mixing angle
5727006 all we know so far is that it is small
5727007 this would show that the neutrino is its own antiparticle
5727008 currently some evidence suggests that neutrinos are different from antineutrinos while certain theories predict that they are actually the same particle it is important to understand whether those theories are true or not
5727009 there should have been equal amounts of matter and anti matter present at the big bang the beginning of the universe
5727010 today however matter dominates our earth explaining why we dont annihilate each other when we shake hands if the neutrino turns out to be its own antiparticle this might help us to understand more about this imbalance
5727011 this experiment asks key questions about how our corner of the universe exists today as it does with matter but no anti matter
5727012 we show that a highly desired attribute of the job authority comes with some interpersonal costs but those costs arent distributed equally across key social groups
5727013 brachytherapy may be the preferable treatment for obese men with early stage prostate cancer
5727014 being overweight does not present any unique technical challenges for brachytherapy as it does for surgery and external beam
5727015 these national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities the blowing soil and dust young children ingest contains large amount of lead from lead paint and leaded gasoline deposited decades ago and from industrial contamination in indianapolis we found high levels of soil contamination many older urban centers have lead poisoning rates that are 5 to10 times the national average
5727016 our review plus the new directions we suggest for remoisturizing soil to prevent blowing of contaminants confirm that our approach to estimating lead burden and its remediation can be done anywhere in the u s where there is a lead concern the environmental protection agency and the u s department of housing and urban have focused their attention on indoor contamination as the direct source of lead to children it is now time to open the door and solve the contaminated soil problem we hope our study will raise awareness and ultimately funding to stop the poisoning of americas children especially those living in older urban areas
5727017 by outlining specific barriers to use in this population we provide a framework for future early interventions such as parent education and addressing confidentiality concerns
5727018 multiple misconceptions such as side effects that are not known to occur and concerns about confidentiality exist in this population and may influence future use
5727019 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
5727020 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
5727021 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
5727022 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities
5727023 we are encouraged by the fact that pandemic planners are already considering and implementing some of these actions
5727024 we dont have the processes in space to remove excess heat or keep the spacecraft warm in excess cold
5727025 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial currently there is no way to do it for very small spacecraft
5727026 the test for micrometeoroids was very simple we just fired a gun loaded with small particles and tiny harpoon like needles at it
5727027 this work represents a radical improvement over prior work presented by this firm in incorporating a protective layer that drastically lowers the solar absorptance to an acceptable value
5727028 the variable emittance electrochromic technology is an entirely new technology pioneered by this firm to the best of our knowledge no other group has done any work in this area
5727029 a lot of spacecraft engineers have come to us saying if we had this technology it would give us much greater design freedom for future micro spacecraft
5727030 for the first time we present an experimental setup that allows measuring the subtle forces both physical and chemical that arise when single hairs slide past each other or are pressed against each other
5727031 the findings will help provide clearer strategies for optimizing hair care products
5727032 with the problems associated with contaminated heparin produced from pig tissues in china a non animal source of this essential drug is gaining importance
5727033 a safer version of the drug could result in less adverse effects and fewer deaths

5727037 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
5727038 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5727039 we dont have the processes in space to remove excess heat or keep the spacecraft warm in excess cold
5727040 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial currently there is no way to do it for very small spacecraft
5727041 people industries and society itself must be given incentives to change their behavior and patterns of consumption some of the most successful incentives are and will be economic others will have to take the form of regulations
5727042 a very powerful flashlight directed at the moon would theoretically create a bright spot on its surface by simply turning the flashlight sideways the flashlights beam streaks across the sky at speeds far exceeding the speed of light this evidence has long been known and dismissed since the bright spot cannot be used for superluminal or faster than light communication between the earth and the moon the fast motion of the bright spot is simply a geometrical artifact similar in some ways to the point at which the two blades of closing scissors intersect the theory of relativity does not concern such purely geometrical objects
5727043 there are a lot of people who are not here tonight but thanks to everyone who did make it
5727044 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere

5727061 excursions when he asks average folk simple questions about our civic life if you can stop laughing at the utterly ridiculous answers long enough to weep in frustration that is
5727062 i trust that the american people are too smart to be fooled by
5727063 if the process is important to you do what it takes to change it not dishonor it when you said you wouldnt
5727064 thats like saying the process is not good enough just because it didnt work in your favor
5727065 we could have chosen not to endorse anyone but we gave our word
5727066 i see the challenges and difficulties in the community but by working together the community will rise up

5727068 i tell people you dont have to be 40 to 50 years old to be in the political process i want to show people that change can be achieved
5727069 i would work with the city to help rectify the problem we need to connect people to programs and resources and get them back into ownership
5727070 the more opportunities there are the less crime there will be solving the issues of economic development and public safety in district 58b work hand in hand and ultimately bring businesses into the area and increase pedestrian traffic among places of business
5727071 the northside is an untapped resource we have to get the word out no one should have to travel outside of the district to receive services but spend those dollars right here in the neighborhood
5727072 i commend businesses that choose to open on the northside and the gamble will pay off at the very least its attracting people back into the neighborhood
5727073 it goes far beyond police we have to get neighbors and residents involved
5727074 were always hearing about the negatives some people dont know how well our schools can do what about the north high school graduate who received a gates millennium scholarship and a full ride to concordia university
5727075 when people start believing in rumors they believe that they can only do so much eventually they begin to think bad news is normal
5727076 right now were working on a community benefits agreement in the bryn mawr and harrison neighborhoods with regards to the bassett creek valley development which is contracted through ryan companies
5727077 this way we can make sure certain benefits are in place like affordable housing maintaining the integrity of the neighborhood and even ensuring that minorities are helping with the building development process it needs to be a cyclical process so that everyone has the opportunity to be involved
5727078 have the resources and actually know where to go to help or seek help
5727079 ive been thinking about it and i dont think it will help the
5727080 even touch wood with a gold medal i dont think it would help the game that immensely theres still a lot of things to work out and having teams coming in and out of the league theres no stability there
5727081 the fans are going to get fed up with it and i think thats whats happened
5727082 the nbls got a lot of work to do to get to the next level
5727083 i think off the floor there was a problem whereas on the floor theres some great talent the competition is there
5727084 but off the floor the marketing and those types of things need to get in order

5727093 if a kumari wants to travel she should be allowed to do so
5727094 the government has also got to look after the welfare of the former kumaris

5727097 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5727098 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5727099 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5727100 probably fannie mae and freddie mac despite what u s treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
5727101 long term investments that means portfolio assets those are the assets that everybody is writing down right now this explains why bacs stock price has been dropping for the last year the market really has no idea what these assets are worth

5727108 there has been a lot of leaking in this building
5727109 it gets fixed on a reactive mode a very expensive plumbing call
5727110 one of the goals of nrp was to reinvent the way the city delivered services that is yet to be realized working directly with the city we can fulfill that vision
5727111 this department will help the city be more responsive to neighborhoods
5727112 so far as i know the program is the most ambitious of its kind in any large or medium sized american city o nly in minneapolis do those citizens receive such substantial funds to translate their discussions and plans into realities
5727113 in an age when so many people have become disillusioned with government your program clearly demonstrates that empowering people into meaningful opportunities in their own neighborhoods can have a tremendously transformative effect
5727114 support neighborhood organizations strengthen resident involvement in neighborhood and community organizations and coordinate activities between the city and neighborhood and community organizations
5727115 we needed to find a way to sustain it in the long term with a more direct relationship with the city we need to break down the barriers
5727116 it focuses attention of city hall policymakers and staff making sure our relationship with neighbors is close productive and positive the new department will have nrp as one of the programs inside the department but it wont be the only function it will serve as a place where neighbors can interact with the city on a number of issues
5727117 the thing that distinguishes nrp is the level of control
5727118 were talking about real empowerment residents are treated more as equals in the discussion
5727119 the danger of it being a city program is that now the direction is that you get support if you play along but what happens if a neighbor doesnt like the way the city wants to deal with it theres always going to be fear that the funding will be cut off if they become too outspoken
5727120 nobody has explained exactly what the city plan is improving
5727121 it makes neighborhoods subject to the whims of the city council which is a recipe for disaster
5727122 has a fixed amount of money for a longer period
5727123 theres a lot of support to keep the structure like this
5727124 everything is a guesstimate its a grand experiment with nothing behind it
5727125 logos and law in the letter of james the law of nature the law of moses and the law of freedom
5727126 the vehicle failed shortly after liftoff and in no way reached its intended position
5727127 the failed launch shows that the purported iranian space program is in its nascent stages at best they have a long way to go
5727128 as in other countries the body can be recognised to perform specified functions as an institutional framework
5727129 the authority is of the view that government intervention in the form of an enactment is not desirable at this stage therefore self regulation through the industry led not for profit body barc has been recommended with government guidelines covering its organisational structure functioning and methodology
5727130 we thought we would be completely booked about six months ago
5727131 i have colleagues who are disappointed with what the outcome has been we expected to be completely booked we are not
5727132 i was impressed by the quality of the craftsmanship but just as much by the fact that they were ardent union members and socialists and anarchists who were very committed to political and economic change
5727133 all these interests in my heritage labor activism and art all came together
5727134 i went up to him and said i wanted to do a documentary

5727141 the kids from mississippi creative arts magnet school made all of these
5727142 our teachers have used the trail in teaching the kids about the outdoors but it wasnt until dan came out and said we want to involve you that we could do a project like this
5727143 we thought about a peace garden behind the lorient kmart with the tiles attached to rocks we would bring in
5727144 but we were lost as we began to think about the magnitude of actually bringing in enough rocks and figuring out a way to attach all these tiles the kids made over 300 plates
5727145 as far as i know there are no other community gardens on
5727146 one of my goals is to reduce the kind of petty crime that occurs along that part of the trail to return a sense of community
5727147 the art and the garden are a breath of fresh air in an otherwise fairly industrial setting
5727148 dar nu i asa acesta este fotbalul un sport imprevizibil unde nu intotdeauna castiga cei mai buni pentru ca mingea este rotunda nu

5727160 after another surprisingly negative quarter it appears that investor confidence in aig is damaged
5727161 we believe the stock may continue to drift down as investors remain wary of the possibility of a dilutive capital raise the potential for ratings downgrades and the corresponding effects on the underlying business
5727162 specifically we foresee 9 billion to 20 billion in economic losses from the credit default swap book which could result in larger cash outlays resulting in a significant shift in the risk quality of aigs assets forcing rating agencies downgrades and resulting in large scale capital raises

5727194 mixed up confusion is one of the bob dylan songs i sing there are borders around any corner and while you drive in a taxi you have enough time to remove them or rearrange them into bridges mixed up confusion is something like that imagine elvis presley singin at folk city

5727225 having said that the conclusion i argue for is a more demanding one than most of us manage to live up to it looks at the difference between what really makes a life better and the sorts of luxuries we might spend money and time on
5727226 can we seriously put our hands on our hearts and say my life has been made better for having spent this money on myself theres a point at which it becomes pretty difficult to defend spending resources on yourself rather than making a monetary sacrifice such as to an aid agency that wont leave you any worse off in the long term but will help other people very significantly
5727227 the serious question weve got to ask ourselves is how much worse off would i really be if i put my hand in my pocket and helped other people for most of us the answer is not significantly if at all
5727228 i am going to give the money away it would be the height of hypocrisy to write a book on this topic and then to pocket a healthy check and spend all of that on myself

5727242 it is therefore in and through the human mind in its moral organization and its social setting that the cosmic process fulfills itself and the completion of its fulfillment would be the final perfection of conscious personality the perfection of man thus merges into the perfection of god
5727243 if history is the completion of the story unfolded in its earlier stages by biology and psychology then theology whose primary data are the lives and experiences of the saints through whom god most fully reveals himself to us should be at once the culmination of the whole
5727244 human perfection which is the truth of all other ideals and the fulfillment of every other doctrine of human good
5727245 if you apply these simple criteria you will quickly come to the realization that for ninety nine percent of human history most cultures have actively stifled the expression of any unique potential while at the same time erecting preposterous worldviews encouraging psychological fragmentation in the form of bizarre rituals scapegoating belief in strange gods paranoia between the sexes racial hatred institutionalized violence pointless taboos and the abuse of children this is why with regard to history my specific recommendation is the same as it would be for anyone involved in an abusive relationship get out

5727286 verliezen is nooit leuk en zeker niet op deze manier door het vertrek van enkele sterkhouders zoals kompany hebben we te veel aan kracht moeten inboeten en das moeilijk om op te vangen ik verwijt de clubs niets omdat ze hun spelers terugroepen maar het is wel jammer bailly had gelijk dat hij kwaad was bij de goals vanop afstand we hebben hem in de steek gelaten nu nog 1 keer vlammen al wil ik daar nu even niet aan denken
5727287 een teleurstellende wedstrijd en nigeria heeft verdiend gewonnen in de eerste helft was het heel warm en hadden we moeite om ons spel op te leggen er was ook veel discussie op het veld over wanneer wie naar voren moest gaan nu moeten we toeleven naar de match voor het brons en ik heb daar alvast zin in

5727300 zapatero tiene que dar explicaciones a 45 millones de espa oles sobre la financiaci n en los servicios p blicos y dejar de esconderse tras las espaldas del ministro de econom a pedro solbes
5727301 ya est bien de que rodr guez zapatero se esconda de los ciudadanos y del parlamento y eluda su responsabilidad cada vez que la cosa se pone fea
5727302 es esencial que sea el presidente del gobierno quien comparezca porque la incertidumbre sobre la financiaci n en espa a es clar sima y no s lo la tienen todos los ciudadanos que est n preocupados por saber qu va a pasar con servicios p blicos como la educaci n o la sanidad sino los propios barones socialistas que est n reclamando reuniones a zapatero para poder hablar y valorar esta cuesti n
5727303 no es mucho pedir que el presidente del gobierno de la cara y las explicaciones oportunas y traslade a la ciudadan a los criterios que va a adoptar para reformar la financiaci n
5727304 ser a muy satisfactorio para todos los grupos parlamentarios conocer con luz y taqu grafos y con los balcones abiertos qu opina el gobierno socialista sobre esta cuesti n
5727305 muchas dificultades para cumplir el estatuto de catalu a que l mismo impuls y aprob
5727306 otra cosa es que la financiaci n de catalu a se conforme de una manera bilateral como defienden algunos y a lo que el pp se opone porque pensamos que la financiaci n tiene que ser por unanimidad y debe ser multilateral

5727315 there needs to be consideration in australia given to the development of a nuclear power industry to a complement the clean energy future
5727316 but it is not likely to be developed until we have the major political parties supportive of it
5727317 we remain open to having discussions with the government if it chooses to change its position on nuclear power but until such time as it does i dont see that its likely to happen
5727318 we cannot envisage any circumstances under which australia will have a nuclear power industry

5727334 we should be buying more not selling off these small parks are meant to be a respite from urban life especially for the elderly and families with small children
5727335 but i dont make the connection between a property the size of this room and green space
5727336 even in some township developments yards are too small to even have a swing where will those kids go without parks and what happens to the crime rate when they end up in the streets
5727337 critics of the citys deal with venture including city county council member jackie nytes contend that the arrangement gives the company an incentive to recommend selling properties because it will be dependent upon commissions to turn a profit beyond the problems in the venture agreement is the bigger question of whether a city with a relatively small amount of green space parks make up only 5 5 percent of indianapolis urban geography should even consider shedding parkland selling the land is a permanent decision that addresses a current dilemma for the long term quality of life of its residents indianapolis needs to find ways to preserve green space add trails and other recreational outlets and expand its parks admittedly the city has struggled in recent years to maintain existing parks but thats primarily because indianapolis spends far less on parks than comparable cities 32 a year per resident compared to 54 in milwaukee and 72 in columbus ohio according to indy parks 2004 master plan ballard has several decidedly difficult decisions to make in attempting to balance the city budget hes argued correctly that quality of life issues such as public safety must take priority parks however also enhance a communitys quality of life the mayor needs to review his administrations deal with venture and needs to reconsider whether shedding parkland provides the best long term stewardship of the citys assets

5727529 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5727530 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5727531 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5727532 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5727533 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5727534 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5727535 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5727536 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5727537 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5727538 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5727539 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5727540 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5727541 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5727542 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5727543 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5727544 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5727545 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

5727557 i extracted some hair from the alleged corpse and examined it and had some concerns
5727558 we burned said sample and said hair sample melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair
5727559 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head

5727601 this worker simply had the papers filled out for him at the plant since he could not read or write spanish let alone english
5727602 i first hope to play here every week and do well for inverness by hopefully scoring goals i can push through on in the international stage and hopefully get a cap there
5727603 id love to be involved with ireland in any game whether its a friendly or a competitive match
5727604 i would love to play for my country and hopefully in two years time i will be doing that at the world cup that has to be any players main ambition
5727605 i signed a three year deal and hopefully ill become a first team striker play every week and score as many goals as i can and hopefully we can end somewhere up the league
5727606 i want to finish as high as we can and im sure all the other players do as well we will do our best every game and hopefully pick up some points
5727607 it depends who we are playing and what type of style they are playing
5727608 there are loads of different formations we could play but the main thing is that everyone works hard for the team and everyone supports each other
5727609 personally i would prefer to play two up top because if you play one up and one off it still requires the other man to push up in support
5727610 we let ourselves down but you get the highs and lows and lets hope we have a lot more highs
5727611 we didnt do anything with any purpose at all and the pitch didnt really help us its not an excuse but it was very dry and made the ball much slower and we couldnt get any tempo
5727612 i thought he did great and i think he will have a big future at caley thistle

5727615 mozart wrote quite a few arias for different soloists to use separately from the operas
5727616 there are a couple of volumes of these concert arias and they are generally performed on their own
5727617 with mozart i would say you have to keep a lightness of voice you need a lightness and control and good coloratura and you have to work at it im a coloratura soprano so that suits me i havent sung it before but ill be practicing
5727618 i wanted the title to carry the suggestion of it having something to do with the sea but without pinning it down too much
5727619 i would like people to hear it and create their own images in their minds i felt it would suggest a circular motion like the ebb and flow of the tide and that idea also has a bearing on the structure of the music
5727620 ultimately the interpretation of what constitutes religious matters should be left to the leaders and adherents of the faith
5727621 the home ministry is not in a position to dictate to the catholics or for that mater the proponents of any other faith the scope o f their religion
5727622 in seeking to control the contents of the herald the home ministrys warning and show cause letters go against article 3 1 article 10 1 a and article 11 3 a of the federal constitution that is the right to freely practise ones religion the general freedom of speech and expression and the right of a religious group to manage its own affairs
5727623 such controls will deprive the catholic community of current information and education in relation to their faith such an act by the authorities is tantamount to curtailment of religious freedom

5727629 carl woese and his colleagues years ago established that protein translation had to be well developed when the evolution of modern cells started
5727630 so the evolution of cells and the evolution of translation are really linked to one another
5727631 to be a molecular signature a sequence has to be common to all members of a single domain of life but not another
5727632 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
5727633 so nobody had ever done this sort of analysis before
5727634 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
5727635 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles

5727941 a woman whose womb and rna are essential to the development of a fertilized egg would be obliged to do nothing that could even inadvertently interfere with the progression from zygote to newborn this would have among other effects such immense impact on access to contraception that it would almost guarantee an increase in unwanted pregnancies and the abortions that mccain opposes
5727942 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5727943 it reflected the careful effort hes made to reach out to the ambivalent middle which is reflected in a democratic party platform that unequivocally defends the right to legal abortion and also calls for better access to contraception and comprehensive sex education
5727944 it was part of the cold war mentality that saw security threats traitors and spies everywhere
5727945 gay people were regarded as vulnerable to blackmail even if they were open and out about their sexuality

5728007 that under the first amendment americans possess the right to raise safety and health concerns about the foods we eat such as the levels of mercury in our fish or the levels of pesticides in imported foods state laws that permit lawsuits against those who question the safety of foods can have a chilling effect on public health discourse that is not the american way healthy debate on issues of public concern is how this country does business

5728102 we saw what could happen we saw what can be done if the community has the resources and somebody to come in and train them ill always be grateful for that

5728153 emirates stadium is impressive and the pitch is like a green carpet upon my arrival i was surprised by the intensity of training and the repetition of passing drills
5728154 i now understand why the arsenal game was so fluid when i watched them on tv last season its too beautiful the game developed by the team attacking a key ball quickly forward suits me perfectly
5728155 i know that if i want to be a regular with france i have to shine at a club like arsenal
5728156 this has been frustrating for everyone at the club especially hugo
5728157 i remembered when john and rio were captain they played very well it was not easy for me to choose the captain they are very good players i think his big personality is the reason i have chosen john but also rio is very important for the team in his position as vice captain
5728158 the captain is very important because he is the driver of the team the season has just started for the national team it is a very important season we have decided the captain we have decided on a lot of the players in the squad and now we have to play every game like a final

5728167 i am still trying to figure out different things like cost and insurance liability
5728168 the governor better play nice or the legislature will give him a spankin
5728169 i think the senate president had the governors back more times than was the best interest of public policy
5728170 i think its a bad thing for gov blagojevich in light of jones being his strongest defender in the capitol
5728171 emil jones used his position as senate president to give those without a voice better health care better funded schools and increases in the minimum wage emil jones is a man with a big heart and a man of action he is a true champion of the people he didnt just do the talk he did the walk all of us in illinois owe him a great debt of gratitude
5728172 this has been a great privilege to work on behalf of the people of illinois for over 35 years
5728173 i want to thank my leadership team and my colleagues in the senate who worked with me side by side to accomplish many things for the people of illinois
5728174 with emil in office it has always been assumed that he would stand in the way of any effort to remove the governor from office with jones leaving who knows what will happen
5728175 i have some different personal commitments that didnt allow me to serve on the board
5728176 how is it you turn around and tell everybody else youve got to do this

5728178 this is not going to go away this is not going to get any better thats my point

5728215 just prior to the attack on moore bertuzzi had been on a shift to kill a penalty had missed the shift change and had remained on the ice for longer than the rest of his line
5728216 after being directed to get off the ice bertuzzi was on his way back to the bench when suddenly and without warning he turned around and skated back in the direction of moore and attacked moore this was not done under any specific or general direction or encouragement from crawford was a direct disobedience of the instruction that bertuzzi had been given from the bench to get off the ice and was a violation of bertuzzis duties which crawford could not be expected to have reasonably anticipated let alone control
5728217 crawford knew or ought to have known that this was likely to result in injury to moore
5728218 crawford denies having provided any instructions to bertuzzi that could reasonably have been interpreted by bertuzzi in a manner that would have resulted in the attack that he ultimately made on moore
5728219 had been relatively lethargic and complacent throughout the game prior to the attack and was not behaving in a manner that should have caused crawford to be reasonably concerned that he might engage in criminal behaviour
5728220 bertuzzis actions were entirely his own and totally unanticipated by crawford

5728295 after another surprisingly negative quarter it appears that investor confidence in aig is damaged
5728296 we believe the stock may continue to drift down as investors remain wary of the possibility of a dilutive capital raise the potential for ratings downgrades and the corresponding effects on the underlying business
5728297 specifically we foresee 9 billion to 20 billion in economic losses from the credit default swap book which could result in larger cash outlays resulting in a significant shift in the risk quality of aigs assets forcing rating agencies downgrades and resulting in large scale capital raises
5728298 the most recent quarter saw further evidence of progress for our business achieving revenues that were 84 of the total revenues for the whole of the previous fiscal year we are also pleased to report the generation of approximately 0 4 million of positive cash flows from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities commonly known as working capital movements

5728579 im able to relax and be with my friends those pretty much are the only people who really know the answer to that question
5728580 lets have keep taxes low lets give every family in america a 7 000 tax credit for every child they have
5728581 im very proud to have recovered a previously missing soldier and who could be of a similar age to me
5728582 this is an unusual discovery as he was a battlefield casualty in full kit buried where he fell rather than a burial in a grave behind the lines
5728583 this is a business for us that is blessed with opportunity
5728584 muri con la cabeza reposando en el pecho de ella
5728585 el libro tiene carga sexual pero en realidad es una novela feminista y no hay nada tan alejado del feminismo como la pornograf a
5728586 i am completely distraught at what has happened but the grounds have been examined this morning and it is absolutely impossible for a stage to be built in these conditions
5728587 even if the rain stops now there isnt enough time for the ground to dry out and the stage to be erected
5728588 for us to have been lucky enough to get the countrys hottest band to perform and then have to call it off at the last minute is just devastating
5728589 its a big resource its got a good cost curve and its not getting enough attention
5728590 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5728591 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5728592 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5728593 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5728594 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5728595 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5728596 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5728597 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5728598 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5728599 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane
5728600 were just happy to continue making the show as it is
5728601 providing effective and efficient transport at an affordable cost is our primary objective and we are well on track to meet these commitments
5728602 the two loop in the inner city and link the orlando stadium with ellis park by passing through the joubert park area
5728603 this initiative will certainly play a significant role in helping to integrate and transform the city and provide an affordable and efficient bus transport system that johannesburg can be proud of
5728604 delays in any of the key areas obviously impact the entire project but after a comprehensive investigation of our progress to date we are confident that we will have all the necessary systems in place to service the confederations cup next year
5728605 tu no sabes que este va pa todo el mundo
5728606 the message we want to take to the world is that we are on course to deliver the best world cup and we will be ready come 2010 and there are no tangible reasons why people should doubt us
5728607 this is evident in our progress report on the various projects such as stadia construction transport and ict infrastructure and our security plan that was submitted to fifa in june among many other milestones we have since achieved as a country
5728608 the top priority is to get controls in place to inform people of the controls in place and thats largely done electronically these days
5728609 the immediate priority for us here is both to cull the affected birds on the infected premises and to establish any possible contact or any potential traces of movement between those premises or related premises or premises in the immediate vicinity
5728610 sixty turkeys out of a flock of 1 000 from one house on the site were found dead the site was immediately isolated and additional bio security measures imposed
5728611 no wild birds have been reported with the disease in europe since the end of august there are a number of other ways that it could have got here and we must not jump to conclusions at this stage
5728612 obviously this is another huge blow to the farming industry which is still dealing with the effects of bluetongue and foot and mouth
5728613 you can reduce the dose from 15 micrograms to 3 8 micrograms which would allow you to make four times as many vaccines
5728614 we were all very pleased to see the results and very surprised that the adjuvant broadened the immune response and range of avian influenza viruses
5728615 the results exceeded expectations but its not crystal clear how the adjuvant works
5728616 und diese quoten sind nicht repr sentativ f r den markt weil wir gezielt dort proben nehmen wo wir anst nde vermuten
5728617 die ergebnisse des jahres 2007 zeigen dass unsere lebensmittel sicher sind und die berwachung wirksam ist
5728618 im vergleich der vergangenen hundert jahre sind unsere lebensmittel heutzutage besser als sie jemals zuvor gewesen sind
5728619 wir haben ein reichliches ausgewogenes angebot einen funktionierenden markt und gute kontrollen wir m ssen aber am ball bleiben
5728620 heute stehen solche seuchen oftmals von einem tag auf den anderen vor der t r
5728621 our message to all bird keepers particularly those in the area is that they must be vigilant
5728622 we have had to deal with this issue before and the important thing is that people know we have placed protection zones around the affected area
5728623 we are very concerned but we have been encouraged by defras comments about the situation of outbreaks in wild ducks
5728624 in those experience has been a very low mortality of the ducks perhaps only 1 and almost immediately or very quickly there has been a build up of immunity to the virus within the ducks
5728625 we are hoping that that scenario within the ducks will be repeated by the swans here at abbotsbury
5728626 we are also working with the health protection agency to ensure that staff and public are fully protected
5728627 i very much hope that we will get through this with the swannery intact because it is a remarkable national institution of real beauty and real ecological significance
5728628 it does seem to be the case that we are going to have to live with this particularly virulent disease
5728629 lets hope that this is all we are going to see of it and monitoring and vigilance will hopefully show that over the next few days
5728630 es wird nur eine l sung geben die eine koalitionsmehrheit hat
5728631 gehen sie davon aus dass die koalition an dieser frage nicht scheitern wird
5728632 die gepr gt sein wird durch wenig totalitarismus und viel liberalit t und gesunden menschenverstand
5728633 denn rechnerleistung allein ist nicht das was die kunden wollen
5728634 das ist als ob man einen porschemotor in eine ente einbaut
5728635 jedes ger t ist ein einzelst ck und keine serienproduktion
5728636 wenn er nachts in einem leisen zimmer auf dem teppichboden ein meter entfernt steht und ich absolut nichts h re
5728637 its all a bit sad to be honest with you i dont really you know if she loves him then good for her but if it was done for attention its a bit sad
5728638 i did stuff like that when i was nineteen as well like get a tattoo because it pi ed my mum off
5728639 its just a great big cry for help and if anything people need to stop talking about her badly and you know maybe all she needs is a hug
5728640 she and max have decided it is better for both of them if she leaves the uk
5728641 our position is that we cant recommend the players tour pakistan
5728642 obviously we put a position forward a few weeks ago to the icc to that effect but we said we would keep an open mind with the task force which we did
5728643 we heard them speak on friday now we have had a chance to digest it all our position hasnt changed
5728644 the web site of the australian department of foreign affairs and trade continues to urge australians to avoid traveling to pakistan
5728645 the likes of kanu and okocha and everyone who won it theyre legends in the country
5728646 hopefully we can follow in their footsteps and repeat history
5728647 when we came into the competition we had the aim to win but we never knew we were going to go all the way to the finals
5728648 but we knew we had a team that can fight and compete for the competition
5728649 they had a great team with more experience we have a team that is younger ready to give their best at any given time
5728650 however at this point in my life i have a number of goals and interests yet to fulfill requiring me to step back at carlyle
5728651 im just going to run my heart out and hope for the best
5728652 im just trying to get through to the next round
5728653 the rivalry has always been there theyve always been strong so its nothing new
5728654 i dont think anythings changed just because of what happening in the 100
5728655 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me
5728656 this release also include a public pre release of microsoft cross platform audio creation tool managed direct code 2 0 clr and direct3d 10
5728657 the most scary thing was the doctors coming at quarter to three in the morning to give us all this stuff
5728658 that was scary and i was thinking gosh i really must be ill
5728659 i didnt think it was the really deadly serious one
5728660 nobody really sat us down and said this is whats happening which i thought was a bit wrong really
5728661 you couldnt go to the shops we couldnt do anything
5728662 we had to rely on people phone people friends and family to actually go and meet the police in the village to transfer whatever we wanted and to bring them up here
5728663 the first diagnosis from the vet was dont worry about it its within the egg chamber and thats why theyre dying so we took no notice until the next week
5728664 when everybody came the next day the police were here defra department for environment food and rural affairs were here the ministry were here yourselves bbc wales were here and i just thought right theres a major problem here
5728665 schade es war die beste k r auf satchmo aber nach so meinem fehler ist das nat rlich schon sehr entt uschend
5728666 das pferd ist eben so genial da passiert sowas schon mal
5728667 ich kann es mir nicht erkl ren dass es wieder zu dem fehler kam
5728668 es ist ein traum wahr geworden nach athen hatte ich mir das so fest vorgenommen

5728701 growing our direct business working with suppliers and developing our relationships within the book trade and internet arenas
5728702 the primary focus for the next three to four months will be on getting a new commercial website up and running for the uk and us
5728703 i think this is a fantastic opportunity the book depositorys focus on delivering real availability within the long tail of titles and their solid growth means that with extra resource we can help grow the business even further
5728704 im clear absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer sometimes i cry
5728705 sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think its all part of healing
5728706 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5728707 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into take care of business mode which was i asked them what do i do now
5728708 immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically

5728724 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure

5728734 does evil exist and if so do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it
5728735 now the one thing that i think is very important is for us to have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil you know a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil in the name of good and i think one thing thats very important is having some humility in recognizing that you know just because we think our intentions are good doesnt mean that were going to be doing good
5728736 new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
5728737 hes talking about ongoing conversations conversations that happen this year next year 10 20 30 years down the road
5728738 as long as water is going to be an issue in the west there should be an open conversation among all parties
5728739 litigation pitting state against state over the colorado river would cost taxpayers millions and the likely result would not please anyone

5728748 their leaders are barbarians they will never leave us in peace
5728749 this is the third occasion that russian soldiers have entered the territory of the port
5728750 it is not a military establishment and the russians had no right to come here
5728751 there were three terrible explosions they say the army base was blown up again
5728752 i dont know what can be left of the base they have been blowing it up without a pause when will it end if we dont die of the bombs then well die of fear for our childrens lives
5728753 they are constantly coming from senaki to zugdidi and back
5728754 they dont communicate with the locals and dont abuse them but people are still afraid
5728755 the boy who lives next door wrote go away russian occupiers in red paint on his fence when the women saw it they panicked and began to scrub it off so the russians didnt see it and the boy got punished by his parents

5728761 with these hands the story of an american furniture factory
5728762 wild caught the life and struggles of an american fishing town
5728763 we read about factory closings all the time but this story will humanize it
5728764 the era in which we all lived is past weve not done a very good job of collecting it and honoring the people that worked in those factories
5728765 within a larger framework of the loss of 3 million manufacturing jobs in the u s this film is a very positive film
5728766 i know thats weird because its a plant closing film but none of the workers were embittered they were glad to work for a great company that treated them well through the process of letting them go
5728767 we want to be able to go through the furniture crescent the area of the world that furniture manufacturers existed in and show the film and talk to the people
5728768 hopefully the people that worked in the factories will have an opportunity to view it
5728769 has been determined that the date was too aggressive and that more time will be needed to finalize the sale
5728770 it is important to note that the expired deadline does not cancel the sale
5728771 the company believes that blackbird and irg remain interested in the company
5728772 the company intends to continue its discussions with its creditors and its efforts to restructure we remain very optimistic during these difficult times we will continue to keep everyone updated as developments arise

5728776 al maliki doesnt believe he has to accommodate these people he will only do it if we twist his arm to the breaking point

5728781 scientists believe that the decline is linked to an onslaught of pesticides mites parasites and viruses as well as a loss of habitat and food
5728782 there is no deal with the president and he had himself resigned

5728784 anyone who tries anything like that will face a crushing response
5728785 so far we have not seen any significant movement out of georgia
5728786 we have seen media reports indicating that people are being shot at while trying to leave the area
5728787 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5728788 today i had a horrifying frightful encounter with the paparazzi while i was with my baby
5728789 i was terrified that this time the physically aggressive paparazzi would put both me and my baby in danger i instinctively took measures to get my baby and me out of harms way i love my child and would do anything to protect him
5728790 i did not consume an alcoholic beverage or any type of medication or drug
5728791 the commission is devoting significant resources to facilitating this transition
5728792 we intend to take whatever actions are necessary to minimize the burden on consumers
5728793 i became interested in the ways people cheat when our hospital started drug testing
5728794 i went home and called some 800 numbers i found online and found i could buy anything i wanted to falsify a test as long as i gave them my credit card number
5728795 some people think if you spend all this money and some of these products cost a lot they will work
5728796 employees know they will be tested employers tell them their places are drug free
5728797 medical defense and airline industries have been testing aggressively for years
5728798 but now its common in other industries too including construction utilities and education thanks to increased awareness of substance abuse employers not only screen employees but also do random testing after people are hired

5729003 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5729004 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5729005 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5729006 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5729007 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5729008 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5729009 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5729010 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5729011 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5729012 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5729013 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5729014 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5729015 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5729016 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5729017 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5729018 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5729019 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5729020 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5729021 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5729022 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5729023 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5729024 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5729025 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5729026 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5729027 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5729028 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5729029 obviamente as federa es que t m responsabilidades nos resultados pois foram elas quem planeou e tratou da prepara o dos respectivos atletas os resultados n o s o motivos para vicente moura n o se recandidatar

5729039 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5729040 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5729041 it could have been over if nixon catches the ball so i think he knew it instantly right after better today than two weeks from now on saturday
5729042 good football players and really tough young men and great kids
5729043 i think maybe if they didnt try so hard and werent so tough it wouldnt hurt me or them quite as bad but they really care about the program and i am excited for the next two to come and for the role that kelly can continue to play they have just been a pleasure to coach
5729044 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5729045 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5729046 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5729047 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5729048 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5729049 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5729050 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5729051 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5729052 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5729053 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5729054 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5729055 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5729056 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5729057 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5729058 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5729059 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5729060 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5729061 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5729062 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5729063 im angry so much that i want to get revenge

5729072 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5729073 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5729074 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5729075 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5729076 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5729077 i am just making sure the mouse doesnt jump up and bite my nis

5729221 they are the ones who put the luster the shine on eaton corp
5729222 if you approve the application you are entitled to come to the zoning office and building permits are issued and they are allowed to start construction
5729223 in this case we approved it with 18 or 19 different conditions most of the conditions related to specific approval criteria
5729224 for example one of them is that they need to provide a de commissioning plan so if a product is no longer in use or they go bankrupt or something we have provisions in place where we can dismantle all of those towers that are sitting out there
5729225 its possible that while they have constructed the lay down yard and are running trucks up in tazewell county while pouring foundations and building towers in logan county that the opposition group files an appeal and challenges our decision which case is now in court and is a brand new hearing
5729226 its also possible that the judge might find that we are in error they had not met the criteria and they could overturn and throw out our local approval
5729227 in which case we have no conditional use of approval granted weve got towers that are under construction we have a lay down yard that is built
5729228 it has to be reviewed by legal counsel and approved by the county board
5729229 oh you find it inconvenient to wait for a doctors appointment sounds like an emergency come on in and sit with some of the most ridiculous people
5729230 you got syphilis me too small world i bet we have a lot in common do you also like to have sex with creepy guys you meet in the er
5729231 wow how do you cope with that have a lollipop and a certificate my wacky friend

5729234 can anyone out there score me some consecrated communion wafers
5729235 theres no way i can personally get them my local churches have stakes prepared for me im sure but if any of you would be willing to do what it takes to get me some or even one and mail it to me ill show you sacrilege gladly and with much fanfare
5729236 you have two choices my fucked up friend first you can quit your job for the good of the children or you can get your brains beat in i give you till the first of the month get that resignation in cunt
5729237 it was basically saying i did it it wasnt my wife
5729238 what i did then was publish a post called pz myers death threat confession i explained what i learned from the letter that this guy is saying his wife didnt do it its not that im really supporting his position i just thought it would be reasonable to do that
5729239 in the same way one does when saying ill beat your ass or kick ill kick your butt or other such niceties used by members of the unpolished masses such as myself
5729240 indeed mrs wargo would not have been fired but for the publication of her email address
5729241 impressed by your knowledge of the quran and islamic traditions having spent a couple of years in the middle east i know something about these things you did a good job of exploring the worm brained mentality of those people at the end we still dont really understand it but then no one from the civilized world ever can and i was pleased to see that you didnt engage in the typical error of trying to make this evil bastard sympathetic or give him human qualities
5729242 the narrator seems to be saying that it was this incident which caused him to take up the jihad but hes being mendacious like all his kind hes incapable of honesty
5729243 if i was working in a professional capacity like as an attorney i would never copy something publicly
5729244 of course as an attorney i have client privilege and all of our emails have the caveat that it cant be reposted or relayed whatsoever in a business capacity yeah if i worked for a business i dont think i would post it as well its just that i really didnt necessarily see this as professional because this is william sanderss home front operation and writing is something that i dont think pays a lot of money i dont see myself making a living as a writer especially now and i think that this realism kind of colored my actions as well thats probably why i didnt react strongly i dont believe that the rejection was business correspondence
5729245 whats strange to me is that it seems like this is the first time in history its ever come up
5729246 some people are saying that posting rejection letters is done all the time and there are people saying that people should be shot for doing it some people think its a generational thing the idea is that older editors basically just expect privacy because theyre used to letters thats something that i certainly didnt dwell on just as william sanders didnt dwell on his rejection letter before he dashed it out i didnt dwell on putting it up on livejournal comments in hindsight its shocking to me that this is an issue that hasnt been resolved i guess people have posted their rejections before but its never contained such controversial content
5729247 if you have a disclaimer on your site then youre free to do whatever you want with an email
5729248 with my own policy i decided not to do it i dont want to scare people away from sending me email i have not received any death threats but in the chance i would i report them to the ip abuse number or contact the appropriate police authorities then its up to them to decide whether anything should be done
5729249 whoa hey everyone stop threatening violence thats not our way

5729257 i remember seeing nastia have hers from the all around and it is so pretty silver is really pretty too
5729258 the thing i really am pleased with is she was a little under the weather and she still was able to do a wonderful routine
5729259 and said can you believe that just happened i knew instantly i was going to medal
5729260 three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
5729261 this was the right ending to conclude the olympic games
5729262 i feel excellent about johnson i think she needed this so much she proved she is absolutely a great balance beam gymnast
5729263 to finally have a gold and be an olympic gold medalist is what everybody dreams of
5729264 we dared to dream he could increase his start value by half a point
5729265 if hed stuck that landing he would have had a gold medal
5729266 scott derrickson the director had a real point of view of what he wanted to do and a reason why he wanted to adapt that film at that time and do it now
5729267 yeah and i think that it was such a great idea i think this film the original film the 1951 version and it was such a great idea i think because it sort of combined its a sci fi film and its beautiful design and its suspenseful and its exciting
5729268 it was such a great framework to discuss those kinds of issues at that time and its 57 years later and there are different things to discuss but the format seems really apt really sort of fitting
5729269 i would consider it more of a drama with a little bit of spectacle in the storytelling but as opposed to the spectacle of just blowing something up this is really driven by story in the best possible way so theres a little bit of stuff in there for the kids but theres also something to think about and the relationships are real
5729270 its such an iconoclastic representation of what a robot is and scott derrickson just really conceptually took it from that place and changed a couple of things and kept some things the same and then gort has a new wrinkle from the original that i hope people will enjoy
5729271 make yourself completely at home explore your world free from any disturbance or distraction if you need me i am here and 100 eager to give you what you want or need

5729276 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5729277 i have never suggested that senator mr mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5729278 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mr mccain you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag

5729280 when has a fetus matured enough to acquire rights under our legal system
5729281 when has a fetus matured sufficiently to acquire rights under our legal system
5729282 i believe that settled law in this country as well as moral decency holds that the state has may protect a fetus from the moment of conception now just so that everyone will be clear i am not saying that the states interest in protection of the fetus trumps the mothers right to control her own body and her own reproduction but starting from conception protection of fetal life is an important goal for our society

5729284 aabid khan was very much the mr fix it of the group
5729285 he preyed on vulnerable young people and turned them into recruits to his cause using internet chat rooms to lure them in then incite them to fight
5729286 while these men may not have been actively planning acts of terrorism themselves they sought to incite others for terrorist purposes promoting al qaeda ideology and training programs

5729289 four years ago the dragon was a reluctant presidential candidate
5729290 fans have asked if hell be running again but given the importance of the upcoming election it seemed appropriate that he would back barack obama the candidate whose politics most reflect his own savage dragon will be giving barack obama his full support

5729296 russia wants to be a respected international player and it can only be so if it lives up to its international commitments i think its important that we dont pursue a policy of trying to isolate russia what we need is hard headed engagement but we will make sure its not business as usual
5729297 i am not one that believes that isolating russia is the right answer to its misdemeanours i think the right response is hard headed engagement
5729298 russia needs to live up to the commitments that president dmitry medvedev has made we are absolutely clear that force cannot be the basis for demarcation of new lines around russia

5729307 nosotros venimos de una situaci n en la que produc amos 5 000 kilogramos de grano por hect rea mientras que en la actualidad producimos de 10 a 12 000 kilogramos por hect rea
5729308 de manera que hemos duplicado la productividad en 10 a os
5729309 tenemos m s chinos comiendo m s indios comiendo m s africanos comiendo y m s brasile os comiendo
5729310 todo esto es tratado por la prensa como si fuera una crisis y se le vende al mundo como si fuera una crisis
5729311 sin ninguna arrogancia o autoimportancia los brasile os necesitamos tomar lo que para otros es una crisis como una extraordinaria oportunidad de transformarnos realmente nosotros mismos en el granero del mundo como mucha gente desde hace mucho tiempo pronostic
5729312 sin duda alguna hay potencial para producir si el gobierno no se atraviesa en el camino
5729313 nosotros ni siquiera vamos a pronunciar la palabra ayuda si el gobierno no pone obst culos a o tras a o generalmente el productor est incrementando la producci n
5729314 si nos referimos a la parte central de brasil todav a hay much simas reas no explotadas por eso no tengo dudas
5729315 lo que hemos visto en los 10 ltimos a os es una revoluci n silenciosa en nuestro pa s principalmente en la producci n agroindustrial
5729316 venimos de ser un participante irrelevante del mercado internacional para ser uno de los mayores abastecedores mundiales de alimentos y biocarburantes
5729317 si usted mira lo que le ocurri a nuestra agricultura en t rminos de exportaciones de carne de ganado o de pollo de nuevo ramos irrelevantes y ahora tenemos la posici n del exportador de alimentos m s grande del mundo
5729318 el impacto emerger con m s intensidad dentro de 20 o 30 a os y hasta entonces deber amos estar prepar ndonos para ello
5729319 la perspectiva por el momento para las futuras cosechas es muy productiva por lo tanto brasil tiene el potencial para seguir creciendo alrededor del 5 al 6 anual en t rminos de aumento de las cosechas vamos a mantener de manera eficaz este ritmo en los pr ximos a os sin ning n problema
5729320 no estamos contra la expansi n de la capacidad del pa s de producir alimentos ni en contra de ayudar al desarrollo de brasil
5729321 usted puede aumentar la capacidad de producci n de alimentos con tecnolog a mejores pr cticas ocupando reas que ya est n degradadas invirtiendo en mejores cosechas
5729322 pero usted no puede aumentar su productividad a costa del medio ambiente porque el mercado global no acepta m s este precio
5729323 si tenemos el adecuado flujo de inversiones para la log stica la infraestructura la tecnolog a y el desarrollo de la tierra el pa s puede aumentar dos y medio hasta tres veces su producci n real en los pr ximos 10 a os
5729324 desde luego tenemos aumentos de productividad que podr an venir de europa ee uu canad y argentina
5729325 pero donde uno encuentra las mejores condiciones para dar a la sociedad mundial la mejor tasa de retorno en t rminos de inversi n es en brasil
5729326 si usted habla de los pr ximos cinco a os ahora producimos 130 millones de toneladas de granos f cilmente podemos crecer a 250 millones de toneladas
5729327 en la actualidad producimos siete millones de hect reas de ca a de az car esto puede aumentar a 20 millones de hect reas ayudando con el suministro de etanol al mundo hoy s lo exportamos us 400 millones en frutas podemos pasar us 3 000 millones

5729329 la demanda mundial de alimentos es de mil millones de toneladas y brasil s lo produce 150 millones
5729330 brasil produce 150 millones de toneladas y el plan que lanz el gobierno para obtener m s alimentos producir seis millones m s lo que deja s lo un mill n de toneladas para la exportaci n c mo va a ser brasil el granero de la producci n de alimentos
5729331 colt brennan had a couple of plays that could have gone either way
5729332 those are the things he can learn from and he has to become a more disciplined quarterback and not risk as much as he did in the game
5729333 this is far too much hype for a late round rookie qb with two quarters of preseason experience

5729342 what does it mean to you to trust in christ
5729343 and what does it mean on a daily basis i mean what does that really look like
5729344 as a starting point it means i believe in that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him
5729345 you publicly say you are a follower of christ what does that mean to you and how does faith work out in your life on a daily basis what does it mean to you
5729346 nearly two thirds of white evangelicals in a recent time poll say they could vote for a candidate whose position on abortion differed from theirs and many evangelicals have like warren broadened their agenda of concerns to include issues that should favor obama like global poverty and the environment but in practice abortion continues to be a threshold issue for a large number of evangelical voters
5729347 each of the three men on stage at saddleback church succeeded in his distinct objective
5729348 rick warren presented a positive image of evangelicals as concerned about a range of issues willing to listen to candidates from both parties and able to address tough issues with civility
5729349 barack obama showed himself to be comfortable among evangelicals able to appeal to them in a language of faith that they understand simply appearing at an evangelical megachurch alongside the gop candidate was a big gain for obama
5729350 john mccain effectively reminded the audience that he has clear conservative positions on a range of issues from abortion and same sex marriage to school choice energy policy and confronting islamic extremism that are much closer to where most evangelicals stand obamas more equivocal answers on these questions highlighted the substantive contrast between the candidates most evangelicals hold to a conservative political philosophy and they are likely to end up voting for candidates who share that philosophy
5729351 a hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor and today that new world is struggling to be born a world quite different from the one weve known a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle a world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice a world where the strong respect the rights of the weak

5729397 one of the most often documented facts is that married people are healthier than non married people but the difference between married and unmarried people has changed over the past few decades
5729398 in general marriage tends to make people healthier happier and richer and thats especially true for men
5729399 an important potential reason is that never married men have greater access to social support now than they did in the past it used to be that having a spouse was important for social support and a social network

5729409 hasta que tengamos un sentido claro de lo que prevalecer los responsables de pol tica monetaria deben permanecer dispuestos a actuar si el crecimiento desacelerado no logra contener las presiones inflacionarias

5729427 there were no mats underneath me just broken glass and death below
5729428 i definitely felt like i had earned my beer after these scenes
5729429 i knew there was going to be some big jungle and rambo stuff happening and physically it was demanding but i have always wanted to do an action film or something with a lot of action and it was so demanding on my body because you have to get out there guns blazing
5729430 at the end of it you are knackered and sore all over but i am glad they stuck with having me look all bloody messy and sweaty the way it would look in reality
5729431 but you gotta survive and take it when it comes
5729432 i dont think i would do anything different because i am a real believer that everything happens for a reason
5729433 i was meant to sing that song and get voted out i wasnt meant to win but that wasnt my attitude when i got voted out i wanted to win and i wanted to get to the end but i kept saying to myself that it wasnt meant to be and it wasnt my time
5729434 so many things are going to be happening its going to be a completely new show
5729435 the changes are going to really make the competition more fierce and a lot more intense and they are basically putting the pressure on the contestants early in the competition
5729436 you deliver or you are out and because of that the top 100 week was so full on but also so amazing
5729437 early in the previous competitions they were singing a cappella and they were all amazing but then they got in front of the cameras and the judges and were singing with the band for the first time and they would freak out
5729438 some people would choke when they had a band to perform with and australia would get crappy performances
5729439 this year they brought the band in during the top 100
5729440 so they have all the pressure piled on them from the very first moment they step off the plane and the faces told it all the way through the top 100 week they had no idea and it was great
5729441 the past couple of years the contestants had preconceived ideas about the competition they tried to play the game but this year there is no playing the game
5729442 at the time greg rang me i had just heard that mark holden wasnt going to be a judge any more and i was freaking out because i didnt want them to ask me to be a judge
5729443 i couldnt do it i couldnt be nasty to the contestants so i was hoping that they wouldnt ask me to be a judge
5729444 but because i have been through it and i understand the emotions they asked me to be a host and a mentor
5729445 the way it was put to me was that i have been there i have been through it myself so i would be able to talk to the contestants and help australia understand what they are going through

5729447 often people find themselves in a situation where they need access to a book immediately and even next day delivery is not sufficient
5729448 we had a student who was working on a paper at 3am that was due at 11am and the only way they could access a textbook they needed was by downloading an e book
5729449 the overwhelming majority of our e books are stored and read on computer screens
5729450 handheld devices like mobile phones and pdas are a small percentage of what we do and of course e book readers like the sony e reader or the irex iliad are small but rapidly growing segments for us
5729451 for the current generation of readers it is going to be hard but generation x and generation y are used to reading from screens and should take to the technology
5729452 what were seeing is that the very notion of what a book is is fragmenting
5729453 all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
5729454 life liberty and the pursuit of linguistic parity multilingual perspectives on the declaration of independence
5729455 the amount of software is growing very rapidly and it is increasingly difficult to find the people and resources necessary to develop it all
5729456 as a result europe is seeing a lot of development work transferring to india and other countries an additional problem lies in the speed of development as it is necessary to get solutions to market in optimum time and with sufficient reliability that it works properly
5729457 agile is a new paradigm for software development that emerged around eight years ago in the usa
5729458 when we started the itea project in 2004 we did not know whether this new methodology could be exploited for embedded software in avionics telecommunications automotive and consumer electronics
5729459 we turned this around to identify those critical features that would be used and put the emphasis on getting them to market first
5729460 so we are not always talking about technical issues when developing software but focusing on business level issues and this was part of the methodology of our development
5729461 eureka projects involve a lot less bureaucracy than with the eu framework programme projects
5729462 moreover over three years the world changes and with eureka you can change the direction of the project meeting better the demands of the industrial partners this is the clear advantage of eureka in addition itea offers a community that meets on a yearly basis and people get to know each other i think both industry and academia find this big networking element strengthens their capabilities
5729463 a set of values and a set of 12 principles provide the underlying rationale for why we operate in this way
5729464 and the process is very tightly time framed with delivery in monthly or even fortnightly cycles in previous approaches we were trying to deliver working systems in maybe three month six month or even one year cycles
5729465 these short cycles demand a radical change in thinking in the development of large hardware bound systems it requires the ability to deliver every two weeks or monthly and so requires rethinking of the whole system how we plan and how we estimate the costs of the development another crucial element is technological requiring investment but the benefits are quite clear
5729466 we showed we could actually achieve up to 70 reduction in lead time and costs
5729467 if these results could be sustained in the larger area of european software development it would be cheaper to outsource from india to europe than the other way round
5729468 we set a benchmark that we can achieve dramatic improvements in all areas in terms of time cost and quality which help shape the future of software development in europe
5729469 we have been able to go beyond what is being done in the usa currently putting europe ahead and while development teams in india and other countries have now set up their own technologies in this area europe has a competitive edge that should last several years

5729472 im not sure that anybody can legitimately say that mccain is conservative
5729473 i havent been on letterman before so i am looking forward to it but it turns my stomach a bit to be honest
5729474 i get butterflies when i think about it but it should be fun
5729475 hopefully if i go back on the view again i will get another chance to chat
5729476 the cigarettes belonged to dale my hair and make up artist so i shot perez an email and we had a laugh over it

5729478 small businesses can take control of their email marketing without having to spend thousands of dollars they cant afford for a marketing professional to create them

5729492 its important for the people of florida to know the citizen soldiers and airmen of the florida national guard are prepared to respond to tropical storm fay as assigned by the florida division of emergency management
5729493 the national guard is poised to provide humanitarian aid security equipment debris removal and search and rescue assistance
5729494 the guard has continuous contact and coordination in effect with the florida division of emergency management in tallahassee and has established planning cells to ensure a rapid build up of personnel and equipment if needed
5729495 we have much experience in responding to emergencies and we will continue to rise to the occasion
5729496 it is our religious custom not to touch our women so we cannot search females our female iraqi police will be extremely important to use at checkpoints and government buildings throughout the province
5729497 they will bring fresh ideas to how we conduct business
5729498 but im proud to be a part of this page in kirkuks if not iraqs history
5729499 man or woman if you come through our checkpoint we will stop you
5729500 i will be able to take care of my son and also help ensure he has a safe future here
5729501 we are so used to hands on training when showing our recruits how to do something
5729502 in our custom we cannot touch our females that is the only difficult change for me that i see so far it is good that we have female coalition soldiers to help us
5729503 this is going to be an amazing experience for all of us
5729504 im looking forward to helping my fellow female police officer and being a part of the positive historic changes occurring here
5729505 it is increasingly important that we be fully coordinated with the iraqis because part of this is transitioning iraq is moving forward making its own decisions making its own choices
5729506 its not terribly important that we all go to the right objective its important we go to the same objective and if we find out when we arrive thats not where we want to be at least we can all move to some other place
5729507 iraq is transitioning thanks to the extraordinary security gains that our forces and iraqi forces have achieved on the ground
5729508 security gains have created a different climate so there is the opportunity now for us to get after it
5729509 not to have an oil driven economy or massive amounts of oil revenue that will pile up in a central government and create a sort of welfare driven state which is extremely common in the region iraq has the opportunity to emerge as the most diversified legitimate market driven economy in the region
5729510 there is no mystery with the resource space mineral agricultural and hydro carbon resource space combined with the skilled workforce that exists here this country will be one of the leading countries in the region and internationally over the next decades
5729511 we believe that iraq should be built by investment because if iraq was meant to be built without investment it would have been done by now
5729512 the importance of the academy is to increase security capabilities and give the iraqi citizens a safe and secure place to live
5729513 we had been talking about doing some kind of iraqi route clearance capability for a while
5729514 this is a great opportunity to work with our iraqi counterpart and improve their capability as an army with training they didnt have previously
5729515 we spent a lot of time developing the course of instruction and what it was going to look like as far as our partnership with the ia
5729516 we developed a multi staged training program designed to teach the basics to iraqi soldiers
5729517 phase i was to get the ia familiar with the equipment and the basic improvised explosive device fundamentals and to get training with the explosive ordnance disposal team
5729518 they were taught about ied indicators battle drills and how to conduct ied interrogations with the equipment
5729519 that way when they came to us for the partnership they were ready to develop missions with our guys and were ready to begin preparing for joint patrols
5729520 first ia soldiers would come on the fob and conduct rehearsals and then they would conduct combined patrols with the u s soldiers in the lead
5729521 i think that is the one area that the iraqi security forces havent really taken over
5729522 they are capable of raids and cordon and search all on their own but the biggest threat is ieds and explosively formed penetrators for them to be able to have their own route clearance element focused solely on finding and destroying ieds in the area will create maneuverability for other isf and will help them protect the local population from ieds

5729532 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5729533 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5729534 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5729535 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5729536 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5729537 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5729538 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5729539 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5729540 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5729541 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5729542 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5729543 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5729544 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5729545 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5729546 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5729547 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5729548 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

5729551 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5729552 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5729553 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5729554 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5729555 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5729556 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5729557 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5729558 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5729559 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5729560 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5729561 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5729562 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5729563 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5729564 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5729565 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5729566 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5729567 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5729568 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5729569 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5729570 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5729571 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5729572 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5729573 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5729574 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5729575 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5729576 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5729577 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5729578 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5729579 for large spacecraft this is done with mechanical louvers basically glorified window blinds that open and close to allow in or reflect heat
5729580 but as satellites get smaller these systems get too heavy and bulky
5729581 weve used thermal insulation similar to what youd find in a fridge and were finding that we need better ways than purely insulating layers to make sure that our spacecraft maintain the right temperature
5729582 there are lots of ways to cool and heat things but they all tend to be complicated and require power and could potentially break down
5729583 something very simple like this requiring minimal power and with minimal mechanical things to go wrong could be quite a useful thing to put on small spacecraft
5729584 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5729585 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5729586 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5729587 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5729588 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5729589 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5729590 this is a planning took where all things are going
5729591 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5729592 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5729593 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5729594 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5729595 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5729596 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5729597 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5729598 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5729599 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5729600 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5729601 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5729602 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5729603 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5729604 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5729605 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5729606 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5729607 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5729608 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5729609 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5729610 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5729611 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5729612 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5729613 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5729614 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5729615 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5729616 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5729617 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5729618 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5729619 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5729620 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5729621 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5729622 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5729623 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5729624 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5729625 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5729626 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5729627 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5729628 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5729629 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5729630 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5729631 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5729632 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5729633 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5729634 the nato membership was clear that russia had violated international laws as well as the rules of the international game
5729635 i am delighted that i am going to be able to go to georgia to report on real nato unity
5729636 unity that russia must abide by the ceasefire agreement and withdraw its troops and a unity that there must be new practical and political support for georgia as it seeks to defend itself and ensure that its territory is respected that its independence and sovereignty is recognised but also that it starts on the route to nato membership that was set out in may
5729637 i think there was a real feeling in the nato meeting today that russia has failed to live up to its commitments and that has serious consequences for the trust that is placed in russia as an international partner
5729638 russia wants to be a respected international player but it can only be so if it lives up to its responsibilities
5729639 that is the political drive that will ensure that russia lives up to its commitment to withdraw its troops but also that it doesnt make further threats to other neighbours who treasure their own independence
5729640 the quick deployment of international monitors is also vital the uk will play its full part in this
5729641 the scale of russian military activity is very large and that is why georgians are talking about an invasion and why the rest of the world not just in the eu but elsewhere around the un are saying that russia must live up to the commitments it has made to withdraw to before the august 7 boundaries
5729642 what we are going to agree today is a special mechanism that will bind nato and georgia together a nato georgia commission that will take forward that commitment to georgian membership
5729643 we have not been debating timelines today what we have been debating is the route map
5729644 the route map involves practical co operation as well as political co operation between georgia the georgian government the georgian military and nato
5729645 i dont think that is very significant i talked with condi rice last week about how we had to make sure there was proper engagement with the georgian government and we agreed that she would go before todays nato meeting and i would go straight afterwards
5729646 i spoke to the prime minister about this issue yesterday as i have previously
5729647 this is an international crisis in which the government at all levels is acting in a unified and effective way
5729648 will be unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa

5729652 in these experiments we are asking a very fundamental question how can we better understand the detailed properties of neutrinos
5729653 in order to understand neutrino mixing and oscillations we must know the value of the unknown mixing angle
5729654 all we know so far is that it is small
5729655 this would show that the neutrino is its own antiparticle
5729656 currently some evidence suggests that neutrinos are different from antineutrinos while certain theories predict that they are actually the same particle it is important to understand whether those theories are true or not
5729657 there should have been equal amounts of matter and anti matter present at the big bang the beginning of the universe
5729658 today however matter dominates our earth explaining why we dont annihilate each other when we shake hands if the neutrino turns out to be its own antiparticle this might help us to understand more about this imbalance
5729659 this experiment asks key questions about how our corner of the universe exists today as it does with matter but no anti matter
5729660 it is imperative that people with epilepsy and their families are appropriately counseled and the risk associated with these activities is explained to them
5729661 adequate seizure control and taking of precautions should be established for all patients in order to avoid more deaths
5729662 of the doses studied 5 mg of tadalafil appeared to provide a positive risk benefit profile
5729663 one mechanism focuses on the accumulation of intracellular prostatic and bladder smooth muscle cyclic guanosine monophosphate

5729665 korea is a good team because they won all their previous games and they pitched well today
5729666 but we tried different pitchers because the final stage is more important than today
5729667 our goal is to bring individuals and families together to break down the stigmas associated with sex abuse and to leverage a platform where our voice stands against perpetrators and offenders wintre
5729668 just being off the team for those four to five months it was just kinda stressful i just learned a lot i dont know man there was so much going on when i wasnt there and i just wanted be out with the team so i just listened to what coach paterno told me to do and im back now and im happy
5729669 it was a dream but i wasnt sure if it would come true or not till high school then it really set in that this could happen so its pretty neat to do that playing the same position anything i need to know he can tell me so any little thing that i have i say dad how do i do this and hell say do this and do that

5729701 we will evaluate those documents and probably issue a proper tender for supply of the buses for phase 1a of the rea vaya project
5729702 the tender for the buses was only advertised on friday but we have had a lot of interest a lot of documents have been picked up already
5729703 there is a very strong bus body building industry in south africa but in most instances the chassis and the engines are imported from other countries so it just depends on which way the procurement process goes but certainly we are going to try and force local body manufacturing for the brt buses
5729704 what we have found in the inner city is a whole range of very old services that crisscross under the road edith cavell road in particular had a lot of very old water and gas pipes and some of that we have had to replace so it has been more expensive than we had anticipated the funding on that is already covered in the infrastructure contracts
5729705 we recognise that the highveld priority area is one of the most industrialised areas in south africa and perhaps home to some of the most important industries both in economic and strategic terms in this context this area of our country is of vital importance
5729706 we issue a report on the wrongs committed by the company and together with the company agree on a time frame to correct this if they go past the time frame we issue a directive by the green scorpions and then we take action

5729807 it doesnt take a harvard mathematician to deduce this one builders are competing for sales with the large supply of foreclosed homes as well as with home owners in good standing with banks who are trying to sell their homes
5729808 right now there isnt a catalyst to jump start sales or the economy and its a major concern the housing sector is suffering from both the rise in foreclosures during 2007 2008 and a classic overbuild that typically occurs during housing booms in this particular cycle the overbuild was really high in florida california and parts of the southwest u s

5729828 the design work was done during the same time as the building was designed and erected
5729829 we decided early on that we wanted to paint on the surface of the building walls the staircase or stairwell is a bit of a concrete love affair and we wanted something to kind of bounce off that aestethic but at the same time work alongside the material we designed a new typeface called kalmar sans which is available to the museum in a stencil and a non stencil version the stencil for big type and the other for smaller type in print etc the letterforms are to some extent a development of a typeface we designed for mtv uks channel identity some years ago technically we used a vinyl cut out masking so we actually could have used a non stencil font but it looks good by masking out big squares on the wall and placing the type mask we created a signage system that helps you find your way around the museum the base for the sign is a yellow square which is also the base for the logo and graphics that appear in the stationery this square is painted directly over the concrete surface and at some locations it passes over surfaces in laquered wood so accentuating the idea that the square is sort of slapped on to top it off we designed a huge 3 3m slate logo in solid concrete and stuck it into the soil outside the museum i think this works quite well in making the building more inviting and the architecture more accessible as it also strenghtens the graphic quality of the solid black building at the opening the minister of culture spontaneously positioned herself in front of the logo when asked by the press to pose for pictures i also noticed that people tend to stop close to the logo slate for a while before entering or leaving the bulding and many have their photos taken in front of it its nice that it seems to work as a sort of focal point when relating to the building the architecture press has written about it positively thank god as the first post it system for buildings which honestly we never thought about while working on it but undeniably is the natural association to make

5729831 most of our discourses take for granted the premise that we communicate by infusing meaning into some expression then throwing that meaning laden word toward others whose job it is to extract the meaning from what we wrote or said
5729832 we blow meaning into a bubble that floats toward an interlocutors ear then bursts emitting the meaning content for a listeners edification
5729833 words constitute a peculiarly specific subset of the more general phenomenon of meaning light outside our bedroom window means morning a dress suit means professional a smile means happy green means go and so on ad inifinitum latin means sophisticated none of these instances abuses the syntax of meaning nor does any lend itself to the hermeneutics of subsistent meaning theres no morningness in sunlight no professionalism in the suit no happiness in the smile no locomotion in the traffic signal theres no meaning in the painting as magritte would insist meaning is always ascribed whether in anticipation as a communicator or in a moment as an interpreter thus when we perceive light outside the window we ascribe to it the meaning that morning has come even though the light may come from klieg lights for the movie theyre filming outside your window and so on the meaning isnt in the expression or the apprehension but if anywhere in their functional convergence
5729834 each of us has to stand accountable for her or his choice of expression cant just shrug it off as lern 2 take a joke or thats not what i meant for our style of expression for the all the various gestures by which we broadcast who we are and what were about and by the same token were responsible as detecters of meaning for the ways in which we construe the clues around us that responsibility is not circumscribed though by the methods and laws that govern the historical critical method without conceding that there even is such a method in a singular sense or speech act theory or whatever rather we are constrained by the interwoven patterns of expectation and satisfaction of confusion and frustration that constitute the flexible but extremely durable semiotic infrastructure of our common lives the forms of life that shape our expectations about meaning
5729835 interpretive truth thus functions not as a methodological criterion that ensures correct hermeneutical ethics but as a characterization of how life ought to look truth on such an account offers itself to us not as something to be used but as a characteristic of divine life by which toward which in which we should order our way

5729852 in several instances restrictive national policies and trade regulations prohibit effective production and marketing of improved seed varieties and this continues to undermine food security and farm incomes in africa
5729853 only about one third of the maize area in the sub saharan africa is under improved variety seeds
5729854 at a time when we are challenged to raise national maize production in the face of climate change new policies that support efficient seed production processing and marketing are urgently needed
5729855 the seed trade should be liberalised and at the same time seed quality should be better monitored
5729856 this and other measures taken to avoid undue delays in seed variety release will have huge payoffs
5729857 regional harmonisation of seed laws should also be expedited so that seed released in one country but also useful in similar agro ecologies of neighbouring countries can be shared
5729858 costs of inputs like fertilisers and chemicals have gone up by 200 per cent from last year the cost of electricity has gone up together with that of fuel and airfreight everyone is wondering how they are going to survive
5729859 for every bunch of 10 chrysanthemums you buy in holland six come from uganda but whereas some flower firms like wagagai have seen some success in production of cuttings it is not practically possible for the other farms in uganda to switch over from roses
5729860 its very frustrating for investors if you have to keep begging every year to have something as simple as a road upgraded our company pays about ush400 million 247 000 every year in taxes but we also have to pay out another ush10 million 6 000 every year to grade a public road

5729863 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
5729864 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5729865 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5729866 i spoke to him just now and he said everything is ok he is happy to be going home he was in a good mood

5729868 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5729869 so basically i had prophylactic double mastectomies people would say three weeks ago
5729870 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me and so this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5729871 i watched my mother have a mastectomy and then i watched her go through two years of chemotherapy and eight surgeries and a hysterectomy ive watched this woman survive so for me there was always that sense i was going to be okay no matter what
5729872 i really love living and i really love my life and i knew from this moment on there was only going to be good that was going to be coming
5729873 yeah im going to face challenges but you cant get any darker than where ive been so just knowing that in my soul gave me the strength to just say i have to get out there and make this a positive
5729874 humour is everything even in the hospital there was so much laughter that was happening and actually it was sometimes good and sometimes not so good because it can actually be painful to laugh that hard but ive laughed so much in the last three weeks
5729875 i dont want anything to do with this industry it absolutely stinks im gonna go out having told the truth and with my head held high and having stood for something
5729876 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of
5729877 its all done for profit and not for any degree of musical feeling or sentiment and the press distort things to such a degree that youve not got a hope of knowing what the truth is so its not something that i want to participate in or fuel anymore

5729884 anyone who doesnt think this movie will influence the attitudes and behaviour of young people toward people with disabilities hasnt been in a high school or around young kids recently as soon as they leave the theatre kids are quoting movie lines and acting out scenes as well as the actors did they wont care that this movie is meant to be a parody of hollywoods excesses
5729885 our goal is to be aggressive in meeting the need and demand for our products and services throughout this country
5729886 we have already established ourselves as the pre eminent sporting goods retailer in these markets and the growth opportunity continues to be attractive were excited about expanding our footprint and look forward to success in every one of these stores
5729887 you know chuck i might have to get out of the navy
5729888 i was still in the dive i had just started to pull out and got hit by a surface to air missile and it basically took the wing off the aircraft
5729889 and so i was gyrating very violently almost straight down so i had to eject very quickly
5729890 then we all pushed him here to the edge of the lake and the security forces surrounded him at that point everyone in the village was here everyone came down to see the american pilot
5729891 would you like him to be president of the united states
5729892 that depends on the u s people i dont know
5729893 he would never admit the united states made a mistake in the war therefore i say john mccain is an extremely conservative man he was loyal to his ideology
5729894 i wasnt as tough as i had hoped to be and i certainly wasnt as strong as some of my comrades
5729895 there was a correlation between my refusal to accept early release and my treatment
5729896 because after it was clear to the vietnamese i would not do that then the treatment got very much worse
5729897 i think in many ways it was harder on him than it was on me
5729898 this is not true because our nation is civilized and humanitarian and you do not understand the vietnamese nation
5729899 i had my front teeth knocked out i had my cheekbone broken i had my nose broken
5729900 beaten with a fan belt for three of four days
5729901 put your elbows behind your back and tighten up the rope around your elbows until your shoulders dislocated
5729902 its just a chapter in my life that id rather remember the good parts than the bad parts
5729903 i dont know what the point is of going through all that
5729904 we thought wed be home for christmas of 69 and there we were and there we were for three more christmases 70 71 and 72
5729905 and his theory on the war at that time was do it
5729906 reading about people not that much older than me who had gone to jail and suffered beatings in order to liberate a people
5729907 the ark of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice
5729908 for other people to say things like that people wouldnt take it seriously but with barack people really did take him seriously they thought of him as someone who really sincerely believed it
5729909 remember at the time in chicago the wards were really politically motivated
5729910 if you werent onboard with the political process and people in leadership then your garbage didnt get picked up on time and your street didnt get fixed
5729911 politicians understand that the number of community residents that come out for a community meeting probably represent 10 times the number of votes
5729912 it might have been small victories to the outside world but to us it was big it meant those kids could get the jobs they could buy things to start back to school
5729913 we saw what could happen we saw what can be done if the community has the resources and somebody to come in and train them ill always be grateful for that
5729914 im a lot more of a hothead than barack is
5729915 barack is more for compromise you know hell wait and see
5729916 so i would say to myself ok im not really great at the high road because the road is already crumbling ok so i dont know if i can make the road higher
5729917 this is the only area of chicago where real transportation does not run to the city limits
5729918 we have a whole community thats isolated with no way to get to jobs
5729919 with sen obamas help we wound up getting president bush to sign the transportation bill allocating 580 million for the extension of the red line train
5729920 we may someday soon have a president in the white house who will listen to people like us
5729921 then maybe finally well have someone who will respond to our needs

5729926 gods creation is dynamic my art is static although it sometimes gains life
5729927 i have never shared with my students the excruciating nature of writing
5729928 we were bringing each other up to date he was telling me how he mccain had been tortured
5729929 john was complaining that theyd treated him like an animal
5729930 the only friendly thing the guards ever did was hit me on the leg instead of on the head

5729940 until my buddy called my plan had been to continue serving the bush administration cruz said
5729941 i talked about it with my wife and called the next day to say i would be honored
5729942 we are happy we havent decreased the business in any way but the company usually grows like 20 percent every year and that hasnt happened we are trudging through this bush mess and looking forward to the next steps
5729943 the more i get to play characters that are glamorous the less pressure i feel to do it in my own life when its your job to look like that you think ill just wear jeans and the most awesome rock star t shirt i can find if anything its liberated my inner couch potato

5729955 10 books that screwed up the world and 5 others that didnt help
5729956 liberated from the irrationalities of faith and believed with immoderate intensity that the entire destiny and happiness of humanity rested upon his own efforts a very dangerous man indeed
5729957 he found it impossible to believe that a world so full of evil was the work of an author god combining infinite power with perfect goodness and righteousness
5729958 another atheist who gave the world the notion that morality didnt need god it needed only a good ledger to balance out pleasures and pains morality was merely a matter of calculating the greatest possible happiness for the greatest possible number
5729959 from the winter of 1821 when i first read bentham i had what might truly be called an object in life to be a reformer of the world my conception of my own happiness was entirely identified with this object
5729960 comfortable atheists in that they wanted all the moral benefits of christianity except without the christianity part who took the fruits of centuries of christian moral formation for granted even as they cheerfully chopped down the tree that had born them
5729961 epicurus was an atheist convinced that all the worlds evils were caused by religion and therefore religion needed to be swept like rubbish off the historical stage
5729962 anything that experiences pleasure and pain must be included in the moral calculation but heres the contradiction in logic once we add the entire sentient population of every fish fowl reptile amoeba gorilla and so forth the task of ranking and balancing pleasures and pains becomes impossible
5729963 the problem is that mill being an atheist did not see how deep evil runs he believed his declaration of war on merely natural evils was enough to rid the world of all evil preventing heart attacks is all well and good but there is more that ails the human heart
5729964 mill however was too short sighted to see it the nature of evil he could not envision for example the most likely outcome of utilitarianism that it would lead to a society addicted to ever more intense barbaric and self destructive pleasures and that its members would be gibbering cowards in the face of even the smallest pains

5729971 on wednesday ladies are reduced rate or food or pop donations and men are the usual rate
5729972 you both print out your credit reports bring them to dinner and share them
5729973 i regularly hear from readers that they married someone they found out afterwards had tens of thousands of dollars in debt
5729974 your credit reports never co mingle you always maintain your own credit report your scores will never bleed over
5729975 technically you can keep your finances separate and your scores separate but if you are dealing with a bad credit scores it will affect your life
5729976 its harder to get out of a co signed loan than it is to get out of a marriage
5729977 the stunning part is the horrible advice some people get
5729978 for someone to go through a divorce and leave an account open is amazing youre paying a lawyer a lot for advice and they should know better
5729979 and actually pulling a credit report is really a neutral thing in black and white
5729980 say hey how funny would it be to compare our credit scores
5729981 youve got to get off your high horse a little bit keep in mind that the goal is not to make the other person feel bad its to make sure your financial life is as harmonious as possible
