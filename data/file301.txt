3010123 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
3010124 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3010125 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3010126 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
3010127 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him

3010146 if you look at world history ever since men began waging war you will see that theres a permanent race between sword and shield the sword always wins the more improvements that are made to the shield the more improvements are made to the sword we think that with these anti missile systems we are just going to spur swordmakers to intensify their efforts
3010147 we are convinced that the whole project of national missile defense including locating one of the components on czech territory brings with it serious risks like global imbalance rising international tension and the start of new nuclear arms race we dont consider this missile defense project the right tool to solve the serious problem before us
3010148 the reason why we come here is we hope to attract folks to government service

3010151 we did a very broad distribution of information and also had engineers on call for a period of time and advertised that fact so people could call in and ask questions about the issue
3010152 the nice thing about sharing information with other people is they share info with us
3010153 we cant stand in an ivory tower and say were us cert we want to be seen as a place where you can come for information on security
3010154 so its very important that there is little to no chance that it can be interfered with
3010155 when it comes to a specific country attacking the u s i wont comment however we have identified those countries that we consider to have capabilities that could impact our national security
3010156 some exceed our skills some countries are noisier in their techniques
3010157 i worry about the ones that arent hitting our sensors so yes there are countries knocking on our door daily and it does pose a threat to our national security

3010286 i was just hoping i didnt appear too stupid they hit it off quite well that was a good memory
3010287 i knew that he and just about everyone at fort detrick was under a microscope after

3010524 the court found that using reclaimed sewer water to make snow for skiing on an admittedly sacred site posed no substantial burden on the plaintiffs exercise of religion in this case
3010525 according to the court the only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective emotional religious experience
3010526 the court places itself in the position of judging the legitimacy of native american beliefs and practices it becomes the arbiter of religion which is not the proper role for the courts the evidence clearly shows that the peaks are important to 13 of the tribes in the southwestern united states and that using sewer water to make snow on them constitutes a significant burden on the tribes ability to practice their religion
3010527 religious exercise invariably and centrally involves a subjective spiritual experience
3010528 the majoritys misunderstanding of the nature of religious beliefs and exercise as merely
3010529 was passed to protect the exercise of all religions including the religions of american indians if indians land based exercise of religion is not protected by rfra in this case i cannot imagine a case in which it will be i am truly sorry that the majority has effectively read american indians out of rfra

3010540 claims that we can make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media
3010541 our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is

3010561 it was the encounter that would unceremoniously hoist former senator john edwardss extramarital affair into full public view a visit last month with the woman and her baby in a hotel room in beverly hills calif where mr edwards was confronted by reporters for the national enquirer as he tried to leave the building

3010717 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3010718 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3010719 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3010720 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia

3010775 gov charlie crist surprised few last week in announcing his support for amendment 5 the proposed constitutional measure that would eliminate most school property taxes in florida what is surprising is the governor is so blinded by ideology that he will not acknowledge the ever growing evidence that it would cause long term economic and educational harm to our state
3010776 this study blows apart the myth peddled by bad employer apologists that the gender pay gap is simply down to womens choices
3010777 its shocking that 33 years on from the sex discrimination and equal pay acts coming into force pay inequality still blights uk workplaces
3010778 the government must use the upcoming equalities bill to update the law and give it the teeth required to effectively tackle discrimination
3010779 it is unacceptable that the gender pay gap still exists nearly 40 years after the equal pay act we need to improve transparency so that women can see if they are paid fairly and so we can see where more needs to be done
3010780 that is why we have a range of tough new measures in the forthcoming equality bill including banning gagging clauses so employees can compare wages and exploring using the power of public procurement to increase transparency

3010786 ray wants to be away from the spotlight rodney wants it rodney is one of those dudes that wants the ball he wants attention he has a quiet swagger about himself
3010787 if i could compare him everybody always says nfl running back darren sproles
3010788 but he has unbelievably quick feet stop and go like i used to have
3010789 i love it its really nice because theres not all that pressure obviously
3010790 the other thing is you can come into a program thats hyped about one person and surprise i hope to do that i hope to be that running back that comes from the shadows
3010791 from what ive seen darrell is a great player a great running back i think he will perform
3010792 thats perfect for me because i can sit back and compete with him and raise my game up a little bit i think we both can learn from each other in the way we do things
3010793 i want this to continue to move forward i dont want this to languish

3010800 that sticks in my mind because i was totally responsible for that
3010801 i was standing out front thinking if a cop comes by now how am i going to explain what im doing here
3010802 he always had a great vision of what a library should be and how to get there
3010803 he instilled that in staff and left a good legacy to keep us going in the future
3010804 it will be interesting and challenging without him its a big role for someone else to fill
3010805 i cant even remember all the people who were here
3010806 every time i looked in the backyard id see someone different and think when did you get here
3010807 i broke my leg i broke my arm i lost some teeth i had to have stitches in my head
3010808 he told me 20 to 30 police officers and firefighters are going to come over
3010809 livan is a real good control pitcher and he just didnt have his control like he usually does
3010810 we were able got get him into good hitting counts and when he did leave it over the middle do some damage with it
3010811 i leave a lot of pitches on top of the plate im better than that i know that
3010812 he wasnt able to throw quality strikes on either edge and the balls were hit hard
3010813 ive been in this park a number of times but im hopefully a quick enough study to realize the more runs you get here the better you feel

3010851 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3010852 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3010853 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3010854 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3010855 i want to write clean elegant code that results in simple expressive user experiences nothing available today truly satisfies this desire for me
3010856 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3010857 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3010858 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3010859 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3010860 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

3010867 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3010868 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3010869 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3010870 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3010871 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3010872 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3010873 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3010874 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3010875 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3010876 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3010877 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3010878 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3010879 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3010880 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3010881 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3010882 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3010883 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3010884 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3010885 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3010886 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3010887 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3010888 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3010889 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3010890 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3010891 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3010892 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3010893 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3010894 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3010895 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3010896 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3010897 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3010898 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3010899 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3010900 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3010901 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3010902 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3010903 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3010904 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3010905 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3010906 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3010907 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3010908 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3010909 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3010910 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3010911 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3010912 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3010913 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3010914 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3010915 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3010916 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3010917 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3010918 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3010919 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3010920 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3010921 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3010922 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

3010937 who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time
3010938 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3010939 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3010940 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3010941 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3010942 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3010943 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3010944 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3010945 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3010946 who are open to doing something on the production side
3010947 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3010948 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3010949 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3010950 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3010951 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3010952 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3010953 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3010954 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3010955 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3010956 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

3011007 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well

3011110 its peaceful calm and its got a sense of community no matter where you go
3011111 you hear all the time about people starting online relationship that result in offline marriages and affairs with all the online chatting and counseling you do how do you protect yourself

3011116 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3011117 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3011118 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3011119 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3011120 this isnt just a career for me its my passion

3011126 toronto being sex capital of the world wouldnt bode too well with tourists in general
3011127 i dont think our staff know whats going on here and i want to find out and get these shut down
3011128 im hearing from the community that single men are getting out of cabs theres prostitutes loitering around the area theyre picking them up and going into these clubs
3011129 you look at the very few raids that have been done in places and so called bathhouses in recent years so obviously theres a much more permissive attitude on the part of politicians the public interest groups that support these places are much more vocal and politically connected
3011130 there is generally an attitude that if the public isnt complaining about it very loudly the police arent going to enforce it very rigorously
3011131 people always get bent out of shape when heterosexuals want to have sex and i dont get that
3011132 if everyone going into this club knows exactly what theyre going into and kids arent walking by giant signs then no ones being harmed
3011133 were a changed culture where its now seen as wrong to criticize different lifestyles
3011134 its better than a nightclub because theyre not drug addicts or long lineups or people who make a lot of noise
3011135 i dont think they can find this kind of entertainment in their country anymore our clientele is very upscale
3011136 going on the main floor doesnt give you entry to the penthouse
3011137 the younger people are less worried about what will people say
3011138 people who are over 40 want me to blur their faces if i take party pics of them but those in their 20s and 30s are fearless
3011139 the younger generation doesnt really need clubs because things are so open
3011140 i dont think anybody in the neighbourhood had any idea that we existed nor would they have until mark grimes got on tv and started ranting and raving
3011141 ive been doing this for 10 years now and with the 90s and the help of the internet swinging really became pervasive
3011142 it hasnt gotten to the extent in europe where there are 60 clubs but the baby boomers have hit that point where theyre looking for something more to do
3011143 theres not very much the city can or should do
3011144 it probably wouldnt be a good idea for the city to licensed them because then they become an accepted land use
3011145 i dont think there are any more swingers now than 20 or 30 years ago theyre just more open about it
3011146 lap dances can happen but theres not supposed to be any physical contact
3011147 can hardly be supposed to jeopardize a society as vigorous and tolerant as canadian society
3011148 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3011149 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3011150 this things going to crest a half a billion soon
3011151 who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time
3011152 it gives iphone a justifiable claim to being a viable gaming platform

3011175 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3011176 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3011177 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
3011178 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
3011179 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
3011180 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
3011181 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely

3011222 there is a significant need in biology to be able to image at high resolution
3011223 metamaterials would be a better optical imaging method since it would be non invasive
3011224 in the case of such cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock
3011225 an observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it making it seem to disappear
3011226 to scale up such a material to sizes visible to the naked eye will be very time consuming and very costly

3011358 we feel without that our history is being cut short
3011359 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have

3011382 they the eu need to show that there will be a political cost for the action in terms of the relationship of the russian federation with its strategic partners
3011383 we hope the international community will move to some kind of action to protect our statehood
3011384 either we find a way to respond to it together or we have to also live with the decision that we will face a different world tomorrow

3011417 you have got jimmie and carl edwards that to me that seem like the guys that are the guys to beat then i would put kyle next if all things were equal without the bonus points i put myself in there just because our team is so consistent on all those 10 tracks that are in the chase

3011444 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
3011445 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
3011446 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
3011447 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
3011448 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age

3011471 no one knew how to qualify to make sure they were in the four no one knew what order to swim in and one girl was told one week before that she wasnt going to swim she was devastated and then it turned out we needed her
3011472 in fact i cant help but have a pang of envy and wish the team i was on was this team because they are really enjoying themselves
3011473 sweetenham had a theory that if you were smiling you werent trying hard enough but now the guys are relaxed and i believe you are seeing the results
3011474 sweetenham took a lot of flak but he shook things up and secured lottery funding
3011475 weve now had more funding into the sport for coaches facilities its taken that long to see the benefits
3011476 he did give everyone a kick up the backside he did not have man management skills but michael does so between them the pair of given us what we have got today
3011477 its the most emotional swimming meeting ive been in since adrians gold and this eclipses it
3011478 the whole team is absolutely buzzing over it its mind blowing
3011479 looking back in the last 20 years weve had four womens finalists full stop and all of a sudden youve got a gold and a bronze
3011480 i wasnt sure if she had got it until that moment and then i came from behind my cushion and hit the roof
3011481 she said she was just going to have fun with it and warm up for the 800m and see what she could do
3011482 its just a bit scary and thats the word her coach uses a lot about becky when she is on form what she can do is scary
3011483 the last 20 metres were absolutely wonderful becky we were all absolutely stunned
3011484 shes just won a gold medal at her first olympics and she knows she needs to get herself down a bit to work for the relay and 800m she is just so professional and dedicated
3011485 as her mum i am just so proud as i know she can handle it and wont get carried away by it
3011486 she has lots of friends in the relay team and she will really want to do well by them which is good as it will mean she wont think too much about the 800m
3011487 its taken far too long for this to happen so well done champ
3011488 i will play in pain if necessary its a must win game
3011489 we still have some time until the game i think ill be fine
3011490 but its only bruised it will not affect the way i play too much
3011491 we can decide our own fate without having to depend on other teams
3011492 we have a bigger challenge now because we have to win virtually everything if we are to advance to the second round
3011493 during these training sessions we work hard in adjusting our offense but this is not the nba playoffs where you play the same team and have time to make a full study of that opponent
3011494 kompany unilaterally and on his own initiative decided to stay with the belgian team at the olympics and this against the will of his club
3011495 our squad is not strong enough at the moment that we can do without him
3011496 its a great comeback after the disappointment from this morning
3011497 i showed that im still in form this morning i read the race wrong i started too slow and i wasnt able to quicken my pace in the second half
3011498 no but i felt good in the water so i told myself lets go
3011499 weve never raced in the morning not even at our trials never
3011500 we only trained hard in the morning we never raced in the morning
3011501 i will play in pain if necessary its a must win game
3011502 we still have some time until the game i think ill be fine
3011503 but its only bruised it will not affect the way i play too much
3011504 we can decide our own fate without having to depend on other teams
3011505 we have a bigger challenge now because we have to win virtually everything if we are to advance to the second round

3011508 our squad is not strong enough at the moment that we can do without him
3011509 this years report shows that the nhs in the north east has a lot to be proud of as it has some of the best healthcare in the country
3011510 this achievement is without doubt down to the drive and dedication of staff working at all levels of the nhs
3011511 we now want to make the excellent services even better and step up the already successful health improvement work we are doing
3011512 we are committed to taking health and wellbeing to the next stage in the north east and ensuring that all patients have access to the highest quality services possible in the right place and at the right time
3011513 we are taking precautions to make sure the racing area is free from algae bloom olympic manager stephen park was in steady as she goes mode but admitted that the third day of racing had not been as happy as the first two
3011514 i am really happy but there is still a long way to go and that first race today was seriously close
3011515 as for the lead well ill just have to hang on to it
3011516 it was tough out there and you really had to be patient
3011517 we are not thinking about the end result it is all going to plan at the moment we are sailing a low risk regatta at the moment and unless we change our game plan we will keep doing that
3011518 maybe a day off will help were used to winning big events and we are used to staying in front of big events but today we struggled in the chop and the swell we need to look at everything and go back to basics
3011519 we started pretty badly with a 19th in the first race but the second was much better with a fifth leaving them 10th overall most people will be up and down this is qingdao this is what we expected a huge amount of this is risk assessment how much you are prepared to take how much do you need to take
3011520 i had a smile on my face and was singing tunes in my head
3011521 but my heart rate was at max nearly all the way through i race every race as though it was the last but definitely this is going to be an endurance battle

3011528 hes a maverick who is great with the ball in hand he has pace to burn and can beat players with ease

3011700 hai perempuan bejat enyah kamu dari sini agar siksa alloh tidak jatuh ke dalam rumahku karena perbuatanmu pergi
3011701 mengapa engkau menolak seorang wanita yang hendak bertaubat dari dosanya tidakkah engkau tahu bahwa ada dosa yang lebih besar daripadanya
3011702 dosa apakah yang lebih besar dari kekejian wanita pezina dan pembunuh itu
3011703 betulkah ada dosa yang lebih besar daripada perempuan yang nista itu
3011704 orang yang meninggalkan sholat dengan sengaja dan tanpa menyesal dan tanpa rasa takut kepada alloh orang itu dosanya lebih besar dari pada seribu kali berzina
3011705 orang yang meninggalkan sholat lebih besar dosanya dibanding dengan orang yang membakar 70 buah membunuh 70 nabi dan bersetubuh dengan ibunya di dalam kabah dalam hadits yang lain disebutkan bahwa orang yang meninggalkan sholat dengan sengaja sehingga terlewat waktu kemudian ia mengqodhonya maka ia akan disiksa dalam neraka selama satu huqub
3011706 wahai hud ajaran dan agama apakah yang engkau hendak anjurkan kepada kami engkau ingin agar kami meninggalkan penyembahan kami kepada tuhan tuhan kami yang berkuasa ini dan menyembah tuhan mu yang tidak dapat kami jangkau dengan pancaindera kami dan tuhan yang menurut kata kamu tidak bersekutu cara penyembahan yang kami lakukan ini ialah yang telah kami warisi dari nenek moyang kami dan tidak akan sekali kali kami meninggalkannya bahkan sebaliknya engkaulah yang seharusnya kembali kepada aturan nenek moyangmu dan jangan merusak kepercayaan dan agama nenek moyang kita dengan membawa suatu agama baru yang tidak dikenal oleh mereka dan tentu tidak akan direstuinya
3011707 sesungguhnya tuhan yang aku serukan ini kepada kamu untuk menyembah nya walaupun kamu tidak dapat menjangkau nya dengan pancainderamu namun kamu dapat melihat dan merasakan wujudnya dalam diri kamu sendiri sebagai ciptaannya dan dalam alam semesta yang mengelilingimu beberapa langit dengan matahari bulan dan bintang bintangnya bumi dengan gunung gunungnya sungai tumbuh tumbuhan dan binatang binatang yang kesemuanya dapat bermanfaat bagi kamu sebagai manusia dan kamu dapat menikmati kehidupan yang sejahtera dan bahagia tuhan itulah yang harus kamu sembah dan menundukkan kepala kamu kepada nya tuhan yang maha esa tiada bersekutu tidak beranak dan diperanakan yang walaupun kamu tidak dapat menjangkau nya dengan pancainderamu dia dekat dari kamu mengetahui segala gerak gerik dan tingkah lakumu mengetahui isi hati mu denyut jantungmu dan jalan fikiranmu tuhan itulah yang harus disembah oleh manusia dengan kepercayaan penuh kepada keesaan nya dan kekuasaan nya dan bukan patung patung yang kamu pahat dan ukir dengan tangan kamu sendiri kemudian kamu sembah sebagai tuhan padahal ia suatu barang yang pasif tidak dapat berbuat sesuatu yang menguntungkan atau merugikan kamu alangkah bodohnya dan dangkalnya fikiranmu jika kamu tetap mempertahankan agamamu yang sesat itu dan menolak ajaran dan agama yang telah diwahyukan kepadaku oleh alloh tuhan yang maha esa itu
3011708 gerangan apakah yang menjadikan engkau berpandangan dan berfikiran lain daripada yang sudah menjadi pegangan hidup kami sejak dahulu kala dan menjadikan engkau meninggalkan agama nenek moyangmu sendiri bahkan sehingga engkau menghina dan merendahkan martabat tuhan tuhan kami dan memperbodohkan kami dan menganggap kami berakal sempit dan berfikiran dangkal engkau mengaku bahwa engkau terpilih menjadi rasul pesuruh tuhanmu untuk membawa agama dan kepercayaan baru kepada kami dan mengajak kami keluar dari jalan yang sesat menurut pengakuanmu ke jalan yang benar dan lurus kami merasa heran dan tidak dapat diterima oleh akal kami bahwa engkau telah dipilih menjadi pesuruh tuhan apakah kelebihan kamu dibanding dengan kami engkau tidak lebih tidak kurang adalah seorang manusia biasa seperti kami hidup makan minum dan tidur tiada bedanya dengan kami mengapa engkau yang dipilih oleh tuhanmu sungguh engkau menurut anggapan kami seorang pendusta besar atau mungkin engkau berfikiran tidak sehat terkena kutukan tuhan tuhan kami yang selalu engkau ejek hina dan cemoohkan
3011709 aku bukanlah seorang pendusta dan fikiran ku tetap waras dan sehat tidak kurang sesuatu pun dan ketahuilah bahwa patung patungmu yang kamu pertuhankan itu tidak dapat mendatangkan sesuatu gangguan atau penyakit bagi badanku atau fikiranku kamu kenal aku sejak lama aku hidup di tengah tengah kamu bahwa aku tidak pernah berdusta dan bercakap bohong dan sepanjang pergaulanku dengan kamu tidak pernah terlihat pada diriku tanda tanda ketidak wajaran perlakuanku atau tanda tanda yang meragukan kewarasan fikiranku dan kesempurnaan akalku aku adalah benar pesuruh alloh yang diberi amanat untuk menyampaikan wahyu nya kepada hamba hamba nya yang sudah tersesat kemasukan pengaruh ajaran iblis dan sudah jauh menyimpang dari jalan yang benar yang diajar oleh nabi nabi yang terdahulu karena alloh tidak akan membiarkan hamba hamba nya terlalu lama terlantar dalam kesesatan dan hidup dalam kegelapan tanpa diutuskan seorang rasul yang menuntun mereka ke jalan yang benar dan penghidupan yang diridhoi nya maka percayalah kamu kepada ku gunakanlah akal fikiran kamu berimanlah dan bersujudlah kepada alloh tuhan seru sekalian alam tuhan yang menciptakan kamu menciptakan langit dan bumi menurunkan hujan untuk menyuburkan tanah ladangmu menumbuhkan tumbuh tumbuhan untuk kelangsungan hidupmu sembahlah dia dan mohonlah ampun atas segala perbuatan salah dan tindakan sesatmu agar dia menambah rezekimu dan kemakmuran hidupmu dan terhindarlah kamu dari adzab dunia sebagaimana yang telah dialami oleh kaum nuh as dan kelak adzab di akhirat ketahiulah bahwa kamu akan dibangkitkan kembali kelak dari kubur kamu dan dimintai bertanggungjawab atas segala perbuatan kamu di dunia ini dan diberi ganjaran sesuai dengan amalanmu yang baik dan soleh dengan mendapat syurga dan yang hina dan buruk akan diganjar dengan api neraka aku hanya menyampaikan risalah alloh kepada kamu dan dengan ini telah memperingatkan kamu akan akibat yang akan menimpa kepada dirimu jika kamu tetap mengingkari kebenaran dakwahku
3011710 kami bertambah yakin dan tidak ragu lagi bahwa engkau telah mendapat kutukan tuhan tuhan kami sehingga menyebabkan fikiran kamu kacau dan akalmu berubah menjadi sinting engkau telah mengucapkan kata kata yang tidak masuk akal bahwa jika kami mengikuti agamamu akan bertambah rezeki dan kemakmuran hidup kami dan bahwa kami akan dibangkitkan kembali dari kubur kami dan menerima segala ganjaran atas segala amalan kami adakah mungkin kami akan dibangkitkan kembali dari kubur kami setelah kami mati dan menjadi tulang belulang dan apakah benar adzab dan siksaan yang engkau selalu menakut nakuti kami dan mengancamkannya kepada kami semua ini kami anggap omong kosong dan ancaman bohong belaka ketahuilah bahwa kami tidak akan menyerah kepadamu dan mengikuti ajaranmu karena bayangan adzab dan siksa yang engkau bayang bayangkan kepada kami kami menentang mu coba datangkanlah apa yang engkau janjikan dan ancamkan itu jika engkau betul betul benar dalam kata katamu dan bukan seorang pendusta
3011711 mega hitam itu bukanlah mega hitam dan awan rahmat bagi kamu tetapi mega yang akan membawa kehancuran kamu sebagai pembalasan alloh yang telah ku janjikan dan kamu nanti nantikan untuk membuktikan kebenaran kata kataku yang selalu kamu sangkal dan kamu dusta
3011712 aku tidak gila dan bahwa tuhan tuhanmu yang kamu sembah tidak dapat menggangguku atau mengganggu fikiranku sedikit pun tetapi aku ini adalah rasul pesuruh alloh kepadamu dan betul betul aku adalah seorang penasehat yang jujur bagimu menghendaki kebaikanmu dan kesejahteraan hidupmu dan agar kamu terhindar dan selamat dari adzab dan siksaan alloh di dunia mahupun di akhirat

3011730 and as i have said the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like they have a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
3011731 the two camps have worked cooperatively on a draft of the party platform and clinton is set to hit the campaign trail for obama on friday appearing by herself at an obama event in nevada but i want to read the draft and because of this being the first time in history where any individual could submit means without doubt and by direct implication any individual should see and read that draft platform as i type this am on the 11 we are talking the talk but not walking the walk together
3011732 completely idiotic idea that leads to nothing but party disharmony
3011733 its a reflection of genuine frustration by hillary clinton supporters that sen obama seems to have forgotten about 18 million voters
3011734 my concern about sen obama is he doesnt recognize that the outreach to the clinton grass roots has to be more visible more overt as well as more symbolic
3011735 what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
3011736 and as i have said the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like they have a role and that their legitimacy has been validated

3011751 the commercial was produced by a local automobile distributor based on its own judgment and nissan motor has nothing to do with the commercial
3011752 its my opinion that nissan made a huge error by igniting these racist instincts we need to apply punishments against these things in order for nissan to keep its interests in the region it must apologize

3011755 then the palestinian demand for the palestinian people and its leadership would be one state a binational state
3011756 the palestinian leadership has been working on establishing a palestinian state within the 67 borders
3011757 israel is the jewish national home while palestine is the palestinian national home
3011758 the west behaved strangely in the first hours of the attack on south ossetia
3011759 taken into consideration in the future in contacts about other global questions
3011760 it will only be possible to bring down the hamas government in gaza through a military takeover of the gaza strip
3011761 it is safe to assume that hamas decided on this objective long ago because all attempts at dialogue with fatah had failed
3011762 the pa in the west bank under abbass leadership and in cooperation with israel is engaged in an ongoing effort to destroy the hamas infrastructure there and fatah operatives in the strip continued to challenge hamas in part through firing rockets into israel in order to demonstrate that hamas control of the gaza strip is weak
3011763 as long as hamas is interested in continuing the ceasefire it will likely be upheld without significant violations
3011764 by the same token hamas will also be able to fulfill any understanding it might reach with israel or other parties such as egypt and the international community
3011765 it will be possible to arrive at understandings with hamas if it receives something in return that serves its interests such as opening the rafiah crossing
3011766 jerusalem and samaria were always connected in the time of the temples during their destruction and in 1967 when both areas were liberated so too today those who destroyed the jewish towns of northern samaria wish to divide jerusalem and those who strive to return to homesh are struggling to strengthen the holy city
3011767 when the moslems see groups of jews touring the mount they realize that we havent given up on it
3011768 visiting the temple mount is crucial for the jewish experience as well the common understanding amongst jews is that we mourn for the temple during the nine days of av it is almost as if we do that then we dont have to think about the temple for the rest of the year but when you ascend the temple mount you see with your own eyes the destruction continuing and you connect in a deep way
3011769 these three years have been much more difficult than the rockets its hard to believe but it was much more difficult
3011770 i was happy to hear your words at the conference in beit yehoshua i would like to remind you of the question i asked you there and of your encouraging response regarding the possibility of third sector philanthropic contributions for the promotion of peace between the israelis and palestinians as neighbors living together in the region
3011771 to invite you to visit here in our city of ariel as a guest of mine and of the city i would be happy if you would be accompanied by senior functionaries of the pa from our region this in order to have pointed dialogue between neighbors and lay down foundations of co existence and day to day cooperation with no connection to any immediate political solution
3011772 belief that given your international stature former prime minister of britain representative of the quartet and trusted by the sides in our region your cooperation with me and with mayors of local pa towns such as salfit and shechem with the help of the third sector can jump start dramatic moves in the region
3011773 thrown in the oven israel murdered 6 million arabs jews control american politics and dictate decisions of war and peace the jewish state is leading a

3011775 how can we demand that the arab world recognize our borders if we dont recognize the pre 1967 borders
3011776 the maps in most of its textbooks show palestine in place of israel it will be interesting to see
3011777 how shteinitz and his friends on the right will react to education minister yuli tamirs instructions to ascertain that the new textbooks demarcate the green line
3011778 tamir is trying to force her political opinions upon the students of israel
3011779 peace now policy in the education ministry blatantly dictated by minister tamir
3011780 its based on the al qaeda and fbi manuals both of which i have
3011781 since i was a small child in bible school i have believed that the rightful inhabitants of what is now israel are jews and christians
3011782 but as to who owns the land it is the jews historically and rightfully
3011783 i was in florida at the time where i live and i had just been through an operation ten hours before when i saw the attack on the twin towers on television
3011784 my wife was staying in a hotel across the street i left the hospital that day and i shouldnt have it was a tough month a really tough month i just couldnt understand it the attacks on our embassies the cole disaster the beirut attacks i was born in new york city i was raised in new york city and i came from a home on 48th street and 2nd avenue this felt like a personal attack on me
3011785 i was much too old to get into uniform and do anything about it
3011786 in a week the israeli cabinet will meet to decide if any more will be selected to come to israel even for those selected the bureaucratic process will take many more months we are feeling hungrier thirstier and more tired during this tisha bav fast
3011787 but for the falash mura jews tisha bav will not end tonight there will be hunger weariness and despair unless we help
3011788 were standing in front of the u n a very bad place where many would like to do evil to israel given the opportunity in the past we protested for soviet jews it seemed the kremlin would never fall but it did and the jews came out today the situation is even worse oil money is flowing to our enemies iran is trying to wipe us out but right and god are on our side its right to protest and to pray
3011789 we remember gilad shalit and all the other missing israeli soldiers our hearts go out to jonathan pollard this november jonathan will enter his 24th year in prison to my knowledge no soviet jewish prisoner for zion spent so much time incarcerated jonathan we are with you we are one with you
3011790 if israel were to step an inch into lebanon there would be emergency u n security council meetings but when russia invades georgia theres no official word from the u n which is a cesspool
3011791 to the north of israel is hizbullah to the south hamas and the moslem brotherhood which would like to take over egypt iran with missile technology supplied by china threatens genocide against israel we may be in the eye of the storm but we will not be silent we will raise a voice of light of torah of love for our brothers and sisters in israel we raise a voice of love for our brethren in argentina where july 18th was the commemoration of the 14th anniversary of the terrorist bombing of a m i a the jewish community center we say no more darkness only light only that which is good only that which is noble
3011792 it is important to me that this campaign reflects my approach to the 7th district congressional office which is one of servant leadership we can begin now to take action in our communities improve our lives and see the change
3011793 kids in congo were being sent down mines to die so that kids in europe and america could kill imaginary aliens in their living rooms
3011794 sonys playstation 2 launch was a big part of the huge increase in demand for coltan that began in early 1999
3011795 sony and other companies like it have the benefit of plausible deniability because the coltan ore trades hands so many times from when it is mined to when sony gets a processed product that a company often has no idea where the original coltan ore came from and frankly dont care to know but statistical analysis shows it to be nearly inconceivable that sony made all its playstations without using congolese coltan
3011796 this is the biggest day of her life its like having a tear in your wedding dress before you walk down the aisle
3011797 our concern is that theyll have them and that theyll use them

3011826 the manager is speaking with the chairman all the time i think the squad is short and it is important that we get some new players in but the important thing is that the players we sign are good and will strengthen us
3011827 we need players with quality everton is a team already that has quality and we need to add to that moutinho of course is a good player and he is someone that i know he was a star at euro 2008 for portugal
3011828 he is sharp he plays good football and he drives his team forward he is also a leader if he wasnt there would be no way that he would be the captain of a big club like sporting at the age of 21
3011829 if we spend so much money on a player like him he would pay it back in the next few years i would like to see him here because he is portuguese but the reason i would want to see him here most is because he is a good player and will improve us

3011836 she was due on june 15 but was born on april 13 so was nine weeks early which was so worrying
3011837 i went through my pregnancy fine but she was just ready to come out she weighed only 3lb 15oz and was very very small but was healthy thankfully
3011838 she was in hospital for four and a half weeks and we were petrified but we were really lucky because it could have been so much worse
3011839 the staff dealt with it brilliantly they were really good and everything was cleaned several times a day
3011840 we are so grateful for everything the staff did they were wonderful and worked so hard
3011841 she is thriving now shes smiling and happy and is 9lb 10oz
3011842 we were pleased to make so much money because every penny counts and it could help another baby
3011843 we owe them her life because although she was healthy she wouldnt have been able to feed without their help and would have been at risk of infection
3011844 it is wonderful when patients are so kind we are very touched by their generosity
3011845 in recent years we have managed to breed meerkats sheep fish and now pigs

3011865 this is a very sobering video places like lakeland toronto and brownsville are no revivals such as the bible describes watch this video and let us cry out to our god for mercy that he would show such a revival to us in our personal lives and in our churches
3011866 heavenly father may we see revival and bring it about in such a way that we have been lukewarm will be restored to full fellowship with you help us to realize that miracles are the conversion of souls not the filling of teeth with gold dust it is not the calling down of fire but the changing of the mind about our own sin and our worthlessness before a holy and righteous god may we remember that many churches have seen ichabod written over the door and so too could we if we are not willing to confront our sin amen

3011902 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
3011903 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3011904 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3011905 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
3011906 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
3011907 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
3011908 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3011909 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family

3011948 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3011949 interesting to me that here we are trying to promote peace and harmony and were witnessing a conflict take place
3011950 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
3011951 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
3011952 there is no possibility of drawing nato or the international community into this
3011953 weve placed ourselves in a position that globally we dont have the wherewithal to do anything
3011954 the ioc means business in stamping out those who are not playing by the rules

3011987 caveat emptor applies when buying any product online from an unknown source or a reseller like e bay or amazon it presents a real danger when buying purported cosmetic injectables the buyer has no idea if its product is genuine or safe
3011988 theres a possibility the product has been obtained illegally stored improperly or packaged incorrectly all of these things can lead to poor outcomes including disfigurement infection or in some cases even death it is in your best interest to seek out a qualified physician and not take the risk from buying online
3011989 genuine fda approved cosmetic injections in a proper medical setting administered by a board certified and properly qualified physician are vastly safe and rewarding procedures says coalition leader mark codner md of atlanta ga
3011990 counterfeit injectables and injectables that are not used properly can have devastating side effects by injecting yourself or someone you know you are not only taking on risk you are engaging in the practice of medicine without a license which in all 50 states is a criminal offense
3011991 the success of any cosmetic injection relies heavily on two very important factors your doctor and the brand of injectable
3011992 the expertise and training of your physician and the relationship you have with that physician and the proven track record of an authentic and properly prescribed and administered injectable mean the difference between a good or negative outcome
3011993 the freedom to travel anonymously is fundamentally important to our right to peaceably assemble

3011996 prayerfully i decided to return to gresham setting the story fifteen years after julia hollis and her children first left london for abandoned coaching inn which became larkspur inn i believe readers would like to see how the children philip aleda and grace elizabeth and laurel turn out as adults but i like to inject fresh faces into every book hence jewel libby and her daughter becky find gresham a haven from a bad man writing the book was like coming home visiting old friends
3011997 sienna is being portrayed as a femme fatale and fears for her career because hollywood hates a home wrecker she hopes balthazar can get rosetta to put out a statement saying their marriage was already over they have already got friends to speak out saying he was sleeping on their sofas
3011998 its nonsense that the marriage was already over when balthazar went away in may rosetta thought it was to see his sick mom in germany but she now knows that it was to cavort with sienna in prague
3011999 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit

3012001 we havent announced anything for this type of cheap mini notebook and were still taking this wait and see attitude
3012002 the fact that there are a number of models coming out might give the indication that the market is growing and everybody wants to do this but whats interesting is you pull back the covers and talk to people in the industry and theyre kind of scared
3012003 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well
3012004 we believe the story line of ultra low cost notebooks will increasingly be sidelined as the notebook market continues to offer a better solution and experience at price points similar to what ultra low cost notebooks are hitting
3012005 you are dealing with something which most of us wouldnt use
3012006 in coming months we expect to see signs of a widespread slowdown in the electronics sector which would directly impact semiconductor sales
3012007 as the economic cycle unfolds it seems inconceivable that we will not see a more significant reduction in spending on electronics even in the most resilient of industry sectors and regional markets
3012008 i think it would be great to be in bourne 4 i hope i am but it really depends on where jason goes i mean its really more about him than her i think depending on what they decide for him would determine whether pamela andy can fit into that scenario or not
3012009 there is still limited access to treatment for example my neighboring country zimbabwe it might be politically unstable but there are people on the ground who are suffering and because of sanctions that are being imposed funders are not going to zimbabwe at the end of the day its the lives of individuals and i hope the theme of universal access is really put into practice

3012016 i just heard tonight that bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas
3012017 osama bin laden has just decreed death to all jews and all americans
3012018 language similar to the text of the anthrax letters postmarked two weeks later warning death to america death to israel
3012019 this is next take penacilin sic now death to america death to israel allah is great
3012020 were fighting them there so we dont have to fight them over here
3012021 the government is still searching for evidence that bruce ivins was solely responsible for the 2001 anthrax attacks despite declaring the case solved
3012022 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3012023 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3012024 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
3012025 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance

3012029 sitagliptin is not associated with weight gain or an increased risk of hypoglycaemia but we must consider a number of important points when choosing between treatment options for diabetes
3012030 insulin has been shown to reduce the risk of diabetes related complications
3012031 weight gain and hypoglycaemia can still occur when sitagliptin is used with drugs that cause these effects e g sulfonylureas while there are safety concerns with the glitazones the long term benefit harm profile of sitagliptin is yet to be established
3012032 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
3012033 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
3012034 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
3012035 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic makeup to treat anxiety disorders
3012036 changing the fabric of social networks local and global consequences
3012037 we are moving away from an era that emphasized order and control
3012038 it is a much more frightening place than north america
3012039 terror has no boundaries that is what makes it so frightening for people threats are free floating that is not something you would recommend for mental health
3012040 if we are locked into accountability and structure and hierarchy
3012041 we are the first in the country to have trained personnel who are ready to provide crucial psychosocial support to children who have been traumatised by events or natural disasters
3012042 to enable countries to be more prepared to help children and teenagers in the aftermath of future natural disasters unicef initiated the child trauma psychosocial response training
3012043 the training here was jointly organised by unicef the health ministry and help university college
3012044 this led to the establishment of the national ctprt in december 2007 two months ago 45 members of the welfare department penang hospital police non governmental organisations and healthcare supplier b braun medical industries attended the training here
3012045 when children experience trauma or disasters they develop stress symptoms for example a child who survives the tsunami may become afraid every time he hears the sound of water
3012046 traumatised children cannot help recalling the bad memories so we teach them the techniques to deal with and understand their feelings

3012088 there is a discussion about what are inherently governmental functions

3012092 i am extremely concerned that this theft of information could cause anxiety to our customers particularly our pensioners i am also very concerned that this volume of information was put on a laptop and that we were not made aware by the comptroller of the nature and extent of the loss at the time the theft was reported to the gardai in 2007
3012093 the worst thing that happens to you can be the best thing for you if you dont let it get the best of you
3012094 i try not to date where i work it makes life easier besides the possibility has never really arisen i dont say no to anybody because id hope that people wouldnt say no to me just because im an actor but theyd have to be pretty extraordinary

3012099 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3012100 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3012101 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3012102 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3012103 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3012104 weve had countless calls from homeowners interested in renting out their properties
3012105 but many are waiting in the expectation that they will get more money nearer the games
3012106 most properties in vancouver are sitting at the 400 per bedroom per night rate
3012107 which seems to me a level which may prove comparable to hotel rates
3012108 there are 75 000 hotel rooms and an estimated 300 000 visitors
3012109 anywhere along the skytrain or the rail lines as far out as abbotsford and mission which involve a journey time of a little more than an hour as long as the price is flexible and reasonable may be good options for families on a budget
3012110 i expect visitors to start locking in their bookings soon after beijing is over
3012111 i didnt think my wife would be keen but when we saw we could charge 30 000 she figured it might just be worth it
3012112 a relative of a friend answered the door to their place in whistler and someone offered them 35 000 on the spot
3012113 its a huge inconvenience for us to move out of our home and we should be properly compensated
3012114 but i started talking to other people in whistler about why they werent putting their properties up for rent and they were saying they didnt want to miss the once in a lifetime opportunity of being part of the olympics
3012115 we are seven adults and a five month old baby this time
3012116 we have rented a condo three kilometres from the main stadium and on a subway line for 4 000 the owner is picking us up from the airport buying a car seat for my baby granddaughter and giving us all brand new sheets and towels
3012117 i think 500 per night is a reasonable price for us
3012118 the rapid real estate price rise means that many people are looking for ways to help their mortgage
3012119 theyre not interested in making sure the guests really enjoy their stay its not about being an ambassador for vancouver
3012120 but i can tell you it is very very high
3012121 whether i provide the service or they dry hire the room the fee is the same
3012122 i built in wages and gratuity compensation for my staff and an expectation that whoever is here will break every glass and plate in the place the room will need repainting half the booths will be repaired
3012123 rather than book out an entire restaurant for the duration of the games i would rotate smaller groups providing their vips with a variety of meal options and we can still service our regular customers
3012124 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3012125 the real incomes of working poor families at the lowest 20th percentile of the income distribution grew six times as fast when democrats held the white house
3012126 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3012127 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3012200 although native flavours are starting to appear in chutneys sauces and spice blends in coles and woolies you wont find crocodile meat in the cold cabinet let alone fresh warrigal greens or kakadu plums alongside the salad mix and packham pears
3012201 research shows that we gravitate to flavours that taste the most familiar with such conservative palates australians are not going to rapidly embrace challenging new native flavours
3012202 native foods tick all the boxes of these emerging consumer trends
3012203 csiro is discovering that some native foods have high levels of antioxidants building on the 1980s research that found kakadu plums have the highest fruit source of vitamin c in the world

3012278 we do not plan to break into georgian territory beyond the borders marked to the peacekeepers
3012279 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3012280 what immediately leapt out to me was there was a big resemblance between the little girl on the tram and madeleine
3012281 she was dressed in pink like most young girls had blonde hair and blue eyes and about four years old
3012282 i cant tell you what language they were speaking but i think they were speaking different languages
3012283 the couple did not seem to be familiar to each other
3012284 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken
3012285 somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
3012286 their private investigators will be pursuing this line as an absolute priority to establish if it has been fully investigated and properly ruled out
3012287 unsubstantiated information was received by co14 relating to the disappearance of madeleine mccann
3012288 this was passed on to leicestershire police on 4th march 2008 the information was further discussed with leicestershire police verbally and all possible lines of enquiry were conducted
3012289 leicestershire police passed the information on to the portuguese authorities
3012290 our police our missing person team paedophile unit are not aware of this information we are checking with the british police
3012291 we find it all a bit strange we are not aware and we have never found a paedophile network in belgium that could order sell or buy children like this
3012292 belgian police normally should have been involved via interpol i am told and officials are asking uk police what is going on
3012293 this month we have seen the highest annual price increase on the staples basket since april this year this indicates that shoppers need to keep an even closer eye on what theyre spending
3012294 shopping habits are changing consumers are more cash conscious and consequently despite the overall price increases there are a wide range of offers available in each store this means that discerning shoppers can beat these rises and be smart about the way in which they shop

3012301 bulletin board posts are rather like contributions to a casual conversation the analogy sometimes being drawn with people chatting in a bar which people simply note before moving on they are often uninhibited casual and ill thought out those who participate know this and expect a certain amount of repartee or give and take
3012302 when considered in the context of defamation law therefore communications of this kind are much more akin to slanders this cause of action being nowadays relatively rare than to the usual more permanent kind of communications found in libel actions people do not often take a thread and go through it as a whole like a newspaper article they tend to read the remarks make their own contributions if they feel inclined and think no more about it
3012303 saakaschwilis versuch den konflikt als russisch amerikanisch hinzustellen hat keine unterst tzung gefunden
3012304 gewiss ist dieses land f r amerika geopolitisch von bedeutung wie auch f r jeden staat der anspruch auf die welthegemonie erhebt in jedem fall besteht der wert dieses regimes in seiner antirussischen ausrichtung aber die unterst tzung mit der saakaschwili rechnete hat er nicht bekommen und wird er nicht bekommen auch seitens der nato l nder nicht sie verstehen nur schwer wieso sie mit russland in einer frage in konflikt geraten m ssen ber die es verschiedene standpunkte geben kann saakaschwilis selbstst ndigkeit und unlenkbarkeit erwecken allm hlich unruhe
3012305 wenn russische flugzeuge auf die stlichen vororte von tiflis in der n he des betriebs zur produktion von su 25 maschinen bomben abwerfen und sich die amerikanische f hrung nicht mit milit rischer hilfe f r georgien beeilt wird es f r saakaschwili ungem tlich
3012306 wenn es sich als notwendig erweist zwischen georgien und iran zu w hlen werden die usa iran w hlen denn die nuklearen anspr che teherans machen dem wei en haus weit mehr sorgen als die politischen ambitionen von tiflis geopolitik eben und nichts pers nliches
3012307 die einbeziehung von nato truppen in den krieg ist absolut ausgeschlossen
3012308 die europ ischen armeen haben eine panische angst vor verlusten ein krieg gegen russland ist f r sie ein ding der unm glichkeit das bezieht sich auch auf die usa die zudem voll durch irak und afghanistan abgelenkt sind nur die t rkei die im unterschied zu ihren nato verb ndeten keine eigenen verluste f rchtet k nnte theoretisch georgien zu hilfe kommen es steht jedoch nicht fest dass dies dem wunsch von tiflis entsprechen w rde es besteht die m glichkeit dass die hilfe in gewisser weise zu einer okkupation ganz georgiens ausufern k nnte zweitens w rde die t rkei f r eine operation die mit hoher wahrscheinlichkeit zu einer direkten milit rischen konfrontation mit russland f hren w rde einen sehr hohen preis verlangen sie w rde von den usa eine gr ere wirtschaftliche und milit rische hilfe sowie von europa garantien f r einen eu beitritt verlangen es besteht der verdacht dass man weder in washington und erst recht nicht in br ssel georgiens schicksal f r so immens wichtig f r die eigenen interessen h lt um einen solchen preis zu zahlen
3012309 wir m ssen nach der beendigung des krieges verstehen dass wir jetzt an unserer s dlichen grenze nicht einfach ein unfreundschaftliches land sondern einen direkten feind haben mit dem zu verhandeln viel viel komplizierter sein wird
3012310 die jetzige situation ist nicht mit derjenigen w hrend der yukos krise zu vergleichen im jahr 2004 hat sich die krise um eine einzige firma entwickelt nun aber sind mehrere faktoren zusammengefallen

3012314 es gibt fundamentale faktoren die den russischen effektenmarkt nicht nur am wachstum sondern auch an der beibehaltung seiner positionen hindert
3012315 die chinesen werden abwarten auch die russischen investoren haben zurzeit keine besonderen stimuli ihr kapital in der wirtschaft chinas zu stecken

3012338 sienna is being portrayed as a femme fatale and fears for her career because hollywood hates a home wrecker she hopes balthazar can get rosetta to put out a statement saying their marriage was already over they have already got friends to speak out saying he was sleeping on their sofas
3012339 its nonsense that the marriage was already over when balthazar went away in may rosetta thought it was to see his sick mum in germany but she now knows that it was to cavort with sienna in prague

3012357 gauteng is the hub of both the confederations cup and world cup iam delighted to announce that our stadiums will be ready in time andeven ahead of schedule for both events
3012358 gauteng will host 11 matches in the confederations cup which we are using as a dress rehearsal for the bigger 2010 showpiece
3012359 the confederations cup is vital in terms of making sure we geteverything right we do not anticipate problems but it gives us the opportunity to iron out any problem areas that might crop up before the 2010 world cup and ensure that the 2010 world cup will run smoothly we are ready to meet any challenges
3012360 the gauteng province has come to the party in a big way they have shown they are willing to help us produce two major events and make this the first world cup on african soil the best in the history of fifa
3012361 jordaan said getting the support of the national provincial and local governments was vital to the running of a successful world cup
3012362 we are fortunate that we have the strong backing at all governmentlevels the commitment shown by gauteng underlines that support for the world cup
3012363 we asking for understanding while we upgrade the roads and ourtransport system it will benefit the public in the long run
3012364 in a nutshell it is all systems go from our side we will be ready to do our bit to make sure that we deliver to fifa the best ever confederations cup and 2010 world cup

3012373 high street retailers overtook their online only counterparts for the first time during december 2006 but quickly fell behind again for most of 2007
3012374 however when the high street overtook again last christmas the gap was even greater than before and during 2008 the online only retailers only managed to edge ahead during february
3012375 given the 2 6 percent year on year decline in actual physical visits to retailers reported by experian footfall for july it looks like high street retailers will be more reliant than ever on their online operations this christmas
3012376 the growth of the online fashion industry has been one of the main contributors to the increasing market share of high street retailers online
3012377 however there are exceptions to the rule asos was the second most visited website in our shopping and classifieds apparel and accessories category in july 2008 uk internet traffic to online only fashion retailers has more than doubled over the last 12 months
3012378 consumers may be cutting back in terms of discretionary spending but they are not about to send their kids to school without the necessities
3012379 consumers are clearly shifting to value and one stop shop channels as they seek to optimize shopping trips
3012380 retailers at risk this back to school season are the specialty retailers such as office supply stores where distinct trips are needed and apparel retailers which are heavily skewed to discretionary spending
3012381 consumers recognize that retail prices tend to fall the closer we get to the first day of school
3012382 stung by high gas and food prices many consumers will likely hold out as long as possible waiting for retailers to drop prices on items kids need for the new school year
3012383 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
3012384 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
3012385 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
3012386 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
3012387 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
3012388 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
3012389 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does
3012390 we expect gears to be widely adopted in products like gmail

3012392 gears can be ahead of the curve trying out new ideas that eventually become a new standard
3012393 nothing really comes close to the kind of desktop experience we have in picnik
3012394 itll take an incredibly long time to see it implemented across browsers and a long time to see high level of compatibility where you can really rely on it without a huge productivity drain on developers
3012395 with adobes rev of flash player version 10 theyve done a remarkable job of knocking out key things we had a conversation a year and a half ago where we gave them a wish list they have been really responsive
3012396 if they take a similar sized leap in short order say a years time frame they could be in the game
3012397 if they are the first to nail 3d that could give developers a lot of reasons to use their technologies

3012411 i couldnt do all of the exercises right off i had to build up tolerance
3012412 id say within a couple of weeks i could walk without pain in my knees and it had been a long time since i was able to walk without pain
3012413 in water a person who has trouble moving on hard land with gravity and surfaces can move in ways they would never be able to do out of the water

3012424 when most labels were banging their heads he got it and saw the liberating value of internet distribution to artists and thats what excited him
3012425 he has a very good sense technologically of whats going to work
3012426 he carries all the latest gadgets understands what the artistic involvement can be and is very clued up on the business model thats an extremely unusual combination and he does it in a chummy way
3012427 be it 78s 45s lps or cds it changes the shape of the music with downloading the artistic change hasnt really hit yet but its turned the economic model on its head the major record companies have some smart people looking at digital models but the question is will the people at the top be willing to turn the business upside down

3012457 nach der schwierigen ersten saisonh lfte war es gut dass ich mal zuhause bei meiner familie in australien entspannen konnte
3012458 es stand in der ersten h lfte so viel auf dem kalender es war so hektisch dass es schwierig war zwischendurch mal innezuhalten und ber das bike und die probleme in ruhe nachzudenken die kurze zeit abseits der rennstrecke hat es mir nun erm glicht die dinge zu berdenken und daraus schl sse zu ziehen nat rlich habe ich in der ersten jahresh lfte nicht die ergebnisse gebracht die m glich gewesen w ren
3012459 ich wei genau dass ich mit der ninja zx rr deutlich besser abschneiden kann wir haben das einige male ja gesehen aber ich muss auf jeden fall in der zweiten saisonphase regelm iger unter die top 10 kommen die pause war eine ideale gelegenheit mal die batterien aufzuladen ich komme jetzt zur ck nach europa und bin fest entschlossen in der zweiten saisonh lfte bessere resultate einzufahren damit will ich in br nn schon beginnen
3012460 ich f hle mich ganz gut und m chte jetzt endlich wieder auf die strecke
3012461 mein verletztes knie hat wieder die volle beweglichkeit und ich konnte gut trainieren ich glaube nicht dass mir das noch in irgendeiner weise auf dem motorrad probleme bereiten wird
3012462 es ist jetzt rund sieben wochen her dass ich das letzte mal meinen hintern auf die zx rr geschwungen habe also werde ich erst am freitag im freien training wissen wie es sein wird ich mag br nn sehr gern ich glaube es ist die motogp strecke auf welcher ich die meisten eins tze meiner karriere hatte das bedeutet dass ich die piste wie meine westentasche kenne
3012463 die bridgestone reifen passen dort gut und kawasaki bringt neue teile mit nach tschechien all dies zusammen bedeutet dass wir einige dinge haben mit welchen wir positiv arbeiten k nnen obwohl die rehabilitation zuhause bei meiner familie und freunden sehr nett war freue ich mich auch darauf das team wieder zu sehen wieder auf das motorrad zu steigen und meine ganze mentale kraft auf das fahren zu konzentrieren um ein gutes ergebnis zu holen

3012470 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3012471 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3012472 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3012473 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3012474 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3012475 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3012476 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3012477 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3012478 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3012479 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3012480 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3012481 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3012482 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3012483 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3012484 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3012485 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3012486 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3012487 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3012488 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3012489 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3012490 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3012491 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3012492 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3012493 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3012494 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3012495 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3012496 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3012497 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3012498 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3012499 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3012500 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3012501 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3012502 the month long event which will be celebrated in most districts in the state will culminate at the kadazandusun cultural association kdca building in penampang on may 31
3012503 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3012504 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3012505 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3012506 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3012507 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3012508 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3012509 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3012510 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3012511 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3012512 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3012513 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3012514 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3012515 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3012516 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3012517 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3012518 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3012519 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3012520 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3012521 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3012522 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3012523 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3012524 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3012525 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3012526 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3012527 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3012528 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3012529 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3012530 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3012531 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3012532 il est regrettable qu la veille des jeux olympiques les autorit s g orgiennes aient entrepris des actes agressifs en oss tie du sud
3012533 ont de facto lanc les hostilit s en utilisant des chars et de lartillerie
3012534 cest tr s triste cela va provoquer des mesures de r torsion
3012535 we never stop looking for ways of improving the action on the track
3012536 the two pit stops in the feature race have proved to be the really high pressure points of the events we felt an additional one would not only add another variable into the sprint race mix but also give the crews another opportunity to display their team work when we sat down to discuss ways of improving the series from every viewpoint this was a popular addition however we have also made other changes that will give the teams greater flexibility in certain areas
3012537 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3012538 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3012539 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3012540 we are coming back to take the globacom premier league by storm with the training the team will be technically and tactically balance to take on any club especially the older clubs that have dominated the premier league for a long time
3012541 when these players play top clubs in europe they will be able to take up the challenges that may come during the premier league season we are in the league to prove a point we know our destination courtesy of the mandate given to the team by the governor of the state
3012542 we do not want to be knocked out at this stage and the good thing is that the players are focused we will treat notwane like any other team and the only difference is that this will be a derby i do not want to put my players under unnecessary pressure because that will be suicidal
3012543 its an interesting car and i had a lot of fun its not an f1 car but its not intended to be one it will produce exciting racing allows overtaking and is an extreme drive
3012544 the car has now completed about 3 500 km testing equivalent to about half a seasons mileage and is looking reliable we have spent the majority of time working on the engine and control systems but theres also been work on the tires and chassis so there has been no down time there have been a number of small issues which is to be expected from a completely new package but there is nothing we cant resolve in the coming tests so we are happy with how things are progressing
3012545 weve completed about 900 kilometers approximately 550 miles of testing so far and everything is going relatively smoothly
3012546 the car is performing very well and the driver is happy with it
3012547 the balance is good and the tires are working well we havent done as much testing as we hoped but thats partly because we were waiting on the weather at fiorano
3012548 we ended up just running in the rain in the end but the car looked very quick in the wet
3012549 we look forward to five consecutive days running next week with the tight guadix circuit ideal for further testing of the handling of the car
3012550 we are very pleased to be working with michelin for the next three seasons
3012551 we have run 29 sets of slick tires and three sets of wets so far there are small differences between the spec of the slicks about 50 are control spec so 15 or so test sets
3012552 the championship organizer has decided to produce a new powered by ferrari single seater and michelin was
3012553 its an extremely exciting time for a1gp as we head into the 2008 09 season with plenty of interesting developments in the pipeline we are always looking at ways to enhance the television viewers experience and
3012554 we are expecting an a1gp round in the united states if not two per season and were going to do everything possible to bring the world cup of motorsport to home ground
3012555 we ran out of time to do it properly for the upcoming season
3012556 were a world championship and thats evident by where we race
3012557 we have four rounds in europe were in north america with mexico city south africa china and the pacific rim nations of indonesia malaysia and new zealand we reach large markets in the countries we race and vast audiences
3012558 we have great racing between nations with world class drivers and the addition of our cars being powered by ferrari and a new car design highly influenced by ferrari will take our technology up a notch and bring more awareness to a1gp we think the entire package will be very exciting and attractive to commercial partners
3012559 at present we are preparing the italian driver team our goal is to run a team of four drivers two rookies and two official drivers the goal for this season is to guide a1 team italy to victory
3012560 it is a pleasure to cooperate with a1gp world cup of motorsport the project and the development of the chassis engine package has been done in a record time frame the 8 cylinder engine which will be the basis of the new family of ferrari road car engines has shown excellent performance and driveability it is also important that the first race weekend of the 2008 2009 season will take place at the mugello circuit a top class venue in motorsport in terms of safety and facilities as shown during the last italian grand prix of motogp
3012561 i am happy to contribute to the development of this car i have done a few days of testing and i have to say i am quite happy with the results the car is growing up very quickly and is nice to drive it the engine also has good driveability and the level of performance is very high this package will help make the a1gp world cup of motorsport ever more interesting
3012562 partnering with a world class organization like ferrari officially cements a1gps position on the international motorsport calendar ferrari adds significant value to our brand and in our opinion there is no better partner to progress the series this is the first time ferrari has partnered with another series and we are extremely proud for them to be working with a1gp as the series moves forward into its fourth season
3012563 i live on the water in boca raton i have since 1990 and i am a native floridian and an avid boater
3012564 i called the city and asked how much it needed they gave a number and we came up with it
3012565 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
3012566 oh those two sheets would look amazing with that one over there

3012569 can we bring back the good time of the victim the glow and shine of the girl she will forever have this trauma of having to go through hell who should be protected the victim or the accused
3012570 the public interest demand them to be severely punished under the law even the maximum sentence meted out cannot bring back the girls virgin status
3012571 at least this court knows how long the accused will be behind bars at least until her natural years the victim in now 22 years old a university student she should have a bright future
3012572 the poetry of the language meeting the harsh reality of farm life
3012573 first about the word poor poor is not a bad word replacing it with euphemisms such as underprivileged and under served are well intentioned and sometimes helpful but euphemisms are also dangerous they can assist us in not seeing they can form a scrim through which ugly truth is dimmed to our eyes there are a lot of poor people in america and their voices are largely silenced

3012582 4850 and 4870 crossfire both require large and stable psus in order to play actual games
3012583 with two 4850s paired up in crossfire we once again ran into issues with our power supply our 1000w ocz elitexstream wasnt always enough for the dual gpu setup and in call of duty 4 our system rebooted in the middle of our test at 2560 x 1600 thankfully ocz sent us a pc power amp cooling turbo cool 1200w unit that is certified for use with geforce gtx 280 sli and if it works on that beast it had better work with a pair of 4850s in crossfire the pcp amp c unit is quite loud as we mentioned in our review but it got the job done we were able to run all of our benchmarks without a hiccup after swapping power supplies despite amds small gpu strategy power consumption on multi gpu configurations is still just as much of a problem as it is for nvidia

3012589 the software does not stop shooting smses until the citizens complaint is addressed basically it runs around for you and creates a log of the toil it did if the amc engineer closes the complaint an sms will inform the complainant immediately and seek his opinion the citizen can start off the entire process again if the complaint is not addressed properly and call up the call centre
3012590 the software called servesmart has a multi pronged approach firstly it tells us what people are actually worried about their constant complaints whether they are related to drains water supply garbage or taxes this would help us prioritize on our services
3012591 the ac fares were rs 4 more than the normal amts one this should have been the premium service for niche segment the second question that remained unanswered was on which route do we introduce the ac service this could only come by if we know commuter behaviour on various brts routes we will introduce ac buses in the second batch after commuter behaviour is thoroughly studied
3012592 the one ticket scheme which includes a single pre paid swipe card for travelling in both amts and brts network is not possible now as the software is in process of being developed a control room should come up first for the system only then can we introduce it
3012593 the diversions would exist for a few months but that would be only on one stretch and would not affect the system as a whole
3012594 for instance the buyer may have to furnish his identity and purpose before purchasing it these details will be recorded if necessary the details would be sent to the collectors office for verification in such a case the buyer may not get the chemicals at the shop on the same day
3012595 the fact that there are a number of models coming out might give the indication that the market is growing and everybody wants to do this but whats interesting is you pull back the covers and talk to people in the industry and theyre kind of scared
3012596 we havent announced anything for this type of cheap mini notebook and were still taking this wait and see attitude
3012597 we believe the story line of ultra low cost notebooks will increasingly be sidelined as the notebook market continues to offer a better solution and experience at price points similar to what ultra low cost notebooks are hitting
3012598 theyre delicious sweet but fresh at the same time very well balanced
3012599 nyiptain lagunya barengan prosesnya cuma dua minggu setelah itu rekaman terus mixing sekarang udah rampung

3012612 kemungkinan ada kolaborasi gigi dengan raihan atau ungu dengan bimbo pasti seru
3012613 what we are seeing is more people filling out requests for financial aid and for those who do more people are qualifying and the aggregate need is increasing
3012614 students who havent needed assistance before are coming in you had to expect that this was going to happen with all the news of companies laying off thousands of people
3012615 we expect uc undergraduates to receive about 1 billion in grants and scholarships from uc this year in state federal aid and other sources and that is about 100 million more than our students received in 2007 08
3012616 it is the economy i tried calling the financial aid office many times they say there is nothing they can do about it they said they just dont have enough federal aid and they dont have anything else to give me
3012617 because my fafsa free application for federal student aid says what my mom made last year the government wont give me aid either
3012618 we are talking to families who are seeing really bad economic times investments no longer hold their value i expect we will see more unemployed parents
3012619 we are seeing students whose parents in the past have been able to get money from equity lines those sources are drying up and the cost of living and tuition has gone up and so that contributes to it
3012620 last year and the year before it was a lot easier to get money
3012621 we have awarded aid to more students and more students are seeing the need to take out loans
3012622 we had a number of students who have had the economic hard times of parents losing jobs or their assets what they can liquidate now is different than in january or february when they filed their forms
3012623 i wouldnt be surprised that if in the next couple weeks those that we havent heard from may decide not to come we are working very hard to prevent that
3012624 there was a preliminary project report and thereafter the government of gujarat was to give out its share of amount for the multi crore project as it was a totally gujarat government undertaking

3012648 its just a good place to go and reset every week and find your moral compass i suppose
3012649 for me i want to know that my kids are at least getting some kind of moral guidance throughout their life this church has been good for that
3012650 being a better steward of our lives things have steadily gotten better for us
3012651 all you gotta do is walk around downtown and it becomes instantly obvious that we need a system
3012652 critically important in a community like ours where locations arent always obvious the museum of glass is a perfect example it can be difficult to find
3012653 itll probably be a question as to how we do it not whether we do it
3012654 its a very expensive thing to do but its very important to do
3012655 the really great systems you dont even realize youre using them you look up and its like im where i wanted to be and that was easy
3012656 the best part is when your robot completes the challenge perfectly
3012657 the first two times it wasnt that smoky but last time there was tons of smoke
3012658 its everything from the development of point ruston to lease negotiations at the school building to supervision of employees to the multiple legal actions were involved with
3012659 i dont think you can ask someone to do that for virtually nothing they either wont be able to devote enough time to it or theyre going to be so grossly underpaid for the effort that they put into it that its unreasonable to expect them to do it
3012660 its not reasonable to ask a citizen to do this anymore
3012661 its too specialized theres too much too knowledge you need a consultant for this a consultant for that you need an attorney to protect the mayor from missteps the regulations are so complicated you need a professional
3012662 the councils been talking about how were spending at a deficit
3012663 they want to raise taxes on certain businesses they want to find other revenue sources they want to outsource town services or at least theyre investigating that
3012664 either were in a financial crisis or were not i dont think we are but i still think what we have left in the reserves has to be carefully watched over and i dont think we can afford 100 000 a year right now
3012665 thats part of the curran property thats part of the history of the place
3012666 its not that i particularly like flat roof houses but it is a part of the history of that era
3012667 the house is run down and it needs to be renovated
3012668 that is just not one of the high priority projects
3012669 if there is no group out there willing to take it on we need to seriously consider taking it down
3012670 was perhaps the most prolific architecture in the tacoma area from the 1950s to the 1970s
3012671 it was still in pretty good shape the architecture is pretty amazing
3012672 i think we need to look at it more seriously
3012673 our study is the first to specifically examine psa screening in younger men which provides an important assessment of quality of care especially for high risk groups
3012674 further investigation will be required to understand the impact of new risk stratification strategies with particular focus on the policy implications of potentially large increases in health care resource use
3012675 to look at countries that have few or no commodities such as most of asia to see if commodity prices affect the value of their currencies and if their currency fluctuations may offer predictive power for say oil prices

3012679 i went to prison at the age of 18 years and again at the age of 29 years my daughter miatta was born sick because her mother fainted three or four time because i was arrested nobody apologized when you get involved in an historical process you must take the consequences
3012680 let me say here that insofar as the executions were carried out even though we were not consulted insofar as we did not resign we endorsed what was happening so we take responsibility
3012681 we had seen the blood and the exits of our militants a year before and many of us who had gone through the literature of violence and consciousness building we welcome this in the sense that it happened and we must not cry i hear militants say they cry but ambition should be made of stearner stuff
3012682 i know the persons who wanted to overthrow president tolbert and they did not hide it why dont they come out and tell liberia what they did that led to the overthrow who suggested the lists of the persons to be executed
3012683 mother of all lies and outright fabrications it seems that swearing on the holy bible and or the koran does not mean anything to some people
3012684 it is gravely unfortunate for hon fahnbulleh to misrepresent me i know the persons who wanted to overthrow president tolbert and they did not hide it why dont they come out and tell liberia what they did that led to the overthrow who suggested the lists of the persons to be executed why doesnt that person or persons come out and tell liberia how many more names where listed for execution following the 13 honorable men who gave the order or orders to shoot the innocent men tied to the poles with their eyes wide open watching their fellow liberians killing them who can forget what the liberian people and the world saw that day on the south beach in monrovia
3012685 i learned later on that on the 22nd april 1980 the prc met at the executive mansion and against the background of this cable that had been intercepted the rumors of ivorian troops coming into liberia the prc panic and decided that all the people who had gone before the tribunal would be executed they decided that
3012686 those boys had sent me a telegram saying they wanted to meet with me in new york a b cassell who was consul general at the time told me that they were trouble makers and i should not meet with them but i met with them anyway i told him they are liberians and i need to meet with them
3012687 you cant do anything to me because we are related
3012688 those were the people that generated the excitement that led to the coup
3012689 the object was to destroy the tolbert government it was after that meeting that pal was formed
3012690 i remember when he was released from prison appointed superintendent for grand cape mount county i taught some of his children at the college of west africa
3012691 i think that anyone who participated and or have knowledge of the things that transpired during the period under review or investigation by the trc should present themselves to tell the truth about their roles and involvement in the things that submerged liberia to its current level
3012692 i can understand when people forget some details of events make a misstatement as all human beings make mistakes but it is inexcusable when people simply fabricate or manufacture an untruth
3012693 i was in jail and being beaten when the coup of occurred im not a murderer i did not kill my father
3012694 theyve got my name all over the place that i planned to kill the man who educated me oh god you know its not true that is not true i never planned to kill anybody
3012695 i was in jail and being beaten when the coup of occurred im not a murderer i did not kill my father
3012696 the owner of the insurance company was mr effrian okoro ms munah stubbfield worked for the insurance company the case being was being heard at the probate court under the gavel of judge harper s bailey a decision was made against the individual at the probate court
3012697 the individual took an appeal to the supreme court headed by the then chief justice chea cheapoe the individual and the insurance company was cited by chief justice cheapoe ms stubbfield represented the insurance company at that meeting the chief justice claimed that ms stubbfield and judge bailey bribed him hence he ordered both ms stubbfield and judge sent to jail at the central prison they were in jail for about two days the president samuel doe was informed of this he doe said that chief justice had no right to have jailed the judge and ms stubbfield therefore the went to the central prison and had them released this was the problem that developed between the chief justice and president and subsequently the chief justice was relieved of his position
3012698 my own brother samuel doe labeled me a coup plotter and ordered that i be killed but as god could have it some of the people in the army were people who knew how good i was and set me free
3012699 in other words the government had to be a populace government embracing the people building on the people decentalizing power in the rural areas
3012700 we cannot simply make the revelations and then expect that affected injured individuals will not seek revenge of one sort or the other there is here huge implications for societal peace and reconciliation
3012701 my father was brutalized in this country held in prison and died a broken man beaten on the orders of mr tubman by general kesseley nobody offered me an apology i realized that that was in the context of the revolution my grandfather was dragged through the streets of monrovia nobody ever apologized to my family
3012702 i went to prison at the age of 18 years and again at the age of 29 years
3012703 when you get involved in an historical process you must take the consequences

3012710 surges six fold as media companies step up monetization of unsold online advertising inventory
3012711 online publishers are producing more inventory than the market demands and risk devaluing the premium nature of their brands particularly in light of ad networks growth and their dramatically lower pricing
3012712 building more effective relationships between publishers and ad networks is critical in the longer term both parties will benefit from gains in ad network cpms
3012713 what this benchmark study tells the industry is that there is a need for more sophisticated yield management on the part of premium publishers for stronger partnerships between publishers and ad networks for development of best practices and more focus on the value of interactive advertising
3012714 our industry is at an important juncture and now is the time for publishers to adopt strategic approaches to the use of ad networks who themselves have become critical players in the digital ecosystem

3012724 for the first time weve used rnai to dramatically suppress hiv infection in an organism
3012725 apparently the sirnas kept hiv from entering most t cells and kept it from replicating when it managed to slip inside
3012726 im not saying weve developed tomorrows therapy but this is a major step forward
3012727 weve used a small animal model for hiv and proven that rnai works in that model
3012728 the number one problem with the current antiretroviral drug regimens is toxicity
3012729 gab2 is a signalling protein which means that its involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior of the cell instructing it to do specific things such as divide or migrate
3012730 gab2 performs a number of signalling roles in normal cells throughout the body and is usually switched off when its not needed our task has been to work out how the body switches off gab2 so that we can mimic that process in abnormal cells
3012731 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals
3012732 this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
3012733 as gab2 plays key roles in signalling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms
3012734 we know that testosterone makes males more susceptible to disease
3012735 we wanted to find out if it impacts their behavior as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease
3012736 our plan was to raise the testosterone levels in wild mice and measure the disease risk they posed to the population
3012737 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment these results challenge current practice as endorsed by a national guideline in the uk

3012760 siempre espero con inter s y expectativas un torneo y es un aliciente jugar con los grandes tenistas en wimbledon por ejemplo me enfrent a roger federer antes de lo que me hubiera gustado pero una segunda ronda es extremadamente pronto para jugar contra el mejor jugador de la actualidad pero es un buen momento para derrotarle

3012764 me toc la china como a veces ocurre en el arbitraje y me lo he llevado yo
3012765 el arbitraje unas veces por lo que sea est a tu favor y otras en contra y qu se va a hacer

3012848 establecer regulaciones del uso y la publicidad del tabaco en cualquiera de sus presentaciones bajo el criterio de garantizar proteger y preservar los derechos humanos de los que no tienen el h bito de fumar
3012849 son muchas leyes las que se pueden aprobar pero lo m s importante es que se ejecuten y al minsa le corresponde supervisar el cumplimiento y estamos cabildeando para que se apruebe el nuevo proyecto de ley que encierra ciertamente lo que establece el cmct
3012850 lo que pasa es que en el pa s se aprueban leyes como las del primer mundo no razonables e incongruentes con la realidad de nuestro pa s y por eso no se cumplen porque el pa s no est listo para asumirlas
3012851 nosotros creemos que debe haber una regulaci n pero no una prohibici n total porque tanto derecho tiene el cliente adulto que desea fumar como el que no fuma de que se respete su derecho a no inhalar el humo del cigarro pero se debe buscar el equilibrio los extremos no son adecuados
3012852 no puede haber equilibrio en este caso porque el que fuma mata a otros con su mal

3012854 si una vaca no me pare un ternero por a o no hay leche la leche no aparece sola en las g ndolas de los supermercados para que la leche aparezca debe haber un parto previo y el primer contacto de ese ternero con el mundo en que vivimos desencadena a su vez el fen meno de la lactaci n y es lo que aprovechamos orde ando a esa vaca
3012855 si la vaca no est bien alimentada si no pare y si desarrolla mastitis de nada nos valen los agronegocios la apertura de mercados o que el productor entienda de ingresos o egresos no hay leche y si no hay leche y leche de calidad la producci n se cae y el sector no se desarrolla
3012856 cumplidas estas fases como programas de primer nivel y hasta como l neas pol ticas nacionales podr amos entonces dedicarnos a fases de agregado de valor del producto acopio de leche procesamiento exportaci n agronegocios

3012860 the request for a previous withdrawal of the invaders is just and our government supports it
3012861 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
3012862 over the past two years we have locked up a total 950 000 hectares of standing timber including this fujian deal at an agreed maximum acquisition price per cubic metre
3012863 this is beneficial to sino forest as we expect demand for fibre and its market price to grow continuously and steadily
3012864 georgian forces renewed intense shelling of towns in south ossetia using various forms of weaponry including heavy weapons
3012865 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3012866 i mean the transfer by the united states of a georgian contingent in iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing
3012867 i think we need a bit of experience to help the younger ones because we have a young forward line
3012868 white people spend money to get rich black people spend money to look good
3012869 but unless i sleep with your girlfriend you never punch someone in the nuts ever
3012870 questo non ghiaccio un elementale sta al sole e non si scioglie
3012871 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3012872 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3012873 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3012874 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3012875 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3012929 the key factor in selecting open texts solutions was ease of integration with our existing sap solutions based environment
3012930 no other solution providers were better positioned than the open text and sap teams to support citrix systems with our ap project they brought the right combination of technology and expertise
3012931 ap is about getting the bills paid yet generating invoices and collecting payments has traditionally been a labor intensive process paper invoices and related documents result in money and time wasted on filing retrieving copying mailing or searching for misplaced misfiled paper
3012932 without an effective process solution it is virtually impossible to generate metrics that reduce costs and improve compliance our ap solutions offer powerful capabilities that streamline and automate the invoice handling process and thus eliminate issues that drive up costs linked to each ap transaction
3012933 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
3012934 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every milliliter of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
3012935 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue
3012936 this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
3012937 if we can stop the signal for the proliferation of uncontrolled growth of the cells then we can stop the leukemia in its tracks

3012988 we posted a solid second quarter result with revenue from our new chemistry instrument the heska r dri chem 4000 veterinary clinical chemistry analyzer by fujifilm representing a key factor in our core companion animal health segment product revenue growth
3012989 as we have discussed previously beginning in 2008 we are reporting our domestic net operating loss usage and other deferred tax items as income tax expense this presents a difficult comparison as we did not report these items as income tax expense in 2007 which is why investors will note a large increase in year over year tax expense and a corresponding decrease in net income we have prepared pro forma information to aid our investors in evaluating this accounting consequence
3012990 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
3012991 free this is a prose i wrote just a few hours ago its short and sweet theres a lot of meaning but its between the lines it conveys enough to hear see that is has meaning but not enough to convey all the hidden subtexts behind it just enough to hint
3012992 calls for the people to support jihad in pakistan and lists a litany of grievances against the pakistani government and us involvement there
3012993 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
3012994 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
3012995 with all the problems we have to face here in jamaica internally and within the international frame of relations of production we are lambasted for being homophobic we get bad mouthed in the international press and we are misunderstood we are still number one in the world per capita in sports no one can touch us
3012996 so the olympics now shows them how powerful and not just powerful but positively powerful and enviable we are
3012997 in fact of all the international sporting competitions the olympics is the only one that stops wars we should have 10 olympics
3012998 with 2 7 million people we cant even be seen on the global map but we actually have no comparison per capita when it comes to track and field
3012999 so with all the negative things that are happening we have this its our glory not us being bad and violent and hating gays
3013000 you can attempt to quantify the financial value in many ways but certainly you cannot quantify the value in terms of jamaicas exposure to billions of people for a period in excess of the days of our games and jamaica gets extremely positive exposure right throughout
3013001 we also have the exposure that comes from the opening ceremony where because of the high profile of the athletes we have the international media will be paying attention to jamaica more than ever
3013002 i dont know who would want to put a value on that
3013003 those not connected to sports had better understand that sports is by far the leading thing projecting positiveness on jamaica this is how the whole country benefits whether you are in sports tourism manufacturing or just the ordinary citizen in jamaica
3013004 i think that the country at large benefits and has benefited over the years from all the persons who have represented the country throughout the years at an olympic games
3013005 we have established ourselves in stature sports and music and also most anywhere you go in the world they people can call the name of jamaica it has greater value than even the airfare going to the olympics the returns are very high even if jamaica gets four medals when you look at the number of countries participating in the olympic games and the number of countries that get medals we are dwarfs walking into a country of giants but we stand very tall
3013006 we are part of an international community and this event is the most important sports event in the world and we have athletes who have qualified
3013007 but in addition to that we have a long list of athletes who are at the top of the performance ladder
3013008 if you are at this level you cannot go without the support systems for your athletes competing on the international scene is very complicated and it is a precise set of arrangements that need to be in place
3013009 and if you dont have coaches and physiotherapists your masseurs your team managers who have to attend meetings and ensure that everything is in place for competition it will be totally impossible
3013010 the ioc and the respective international federations in recognition of the support system that is essential have an overall estimate that the support numbers will be about 50 per cent of the athletes numbers
3013011 cycling for example is one on one you cannot send a cyclist without a coach and support methods

3013041 tidak ada ustaz yang saya undang hanya lima orang termasuk ustaz maklum tempatnya sempit
3013042 saya bersyukur kepada alloh karena sejak bulan depan saya bisa mengontrak kamar ini sebulan tiga ribu rupiah tadinya tuan rumah menolak tidak mau menerima uang saya tapi akhirnya ia tidak keberatan sehingga utang budi saya tidak terlalu berat
3013043 hai abu qudamah anda adalah orang yang gemar berjihad di jalan alloh maka ceritakanlah peristiwa paling ajaib yang pernah kau alami dalam berjihad
3013044 suatu ketika aku berangkat bersama beberapa sahabatku untuk memerangi kaum salibis di beberapa pos penjagaan dekat perbatasan
3013045 andakah yang hari ini mengumpulkan dana untuk membantu jihad di perbatasan
3013046 anda mengajak kami untuk ikut berjihad namun aku tidak sanggup untuk itu maka kupotong dua buah kuncir kesayanganku1 agar anda jadikan sebagai tali kuda anda kuharap bila alloh melihatnya pada kuda anda dalam jihad dia mengampuni dosaku karenanya
3013047 demi alloh aku kagum atas semangat dan kegigihannya untuk ikut berjihad demikian pula dengan kerinduannya untuk mendapat ampunan alloh dan surga nya
3013048 hai abu qudamah hai abu qudamah tunggulah sebentar semoga alloh merahmatimu
3013049 kalian berangkat saja duluan biar aku yang mencari tahu tentang orang ini
3013050 segala puji bagi alloh yang mengizinkanku untuk ikut bersamamu dan tidak menolak keikutsertaanku
3013051 perlihatkan wajahmu aku ingin lihat kalau engkau memang cukup dewasa dan wajib berjihad akan aku terima namun jika masih kecil dan tidak wajib berjihad terpaksa kutolak
3013052 ayah terbunuh di tangan kaum salibis dan aku ingin ikut bersamamu untuk memerangi orang orang yang membunuh ayahku
3013053 kembalilah ke ibumu dan rawatlah ia baik baik karena surga ada di bawah telapak kakinya
3013054 subhanalloh alangkah pelupanya anda ini tidak ingatkah anda dengan wanita yang datang tadi malam menyerahkan seutas tali kuda dan bingkisan
3013055 dialah ibuku dia menyuruhku untuk berjihad bersamamu dan mengambil sumpah dariku supaya aku tidak kembali lagi
3013056 ya alloh ya ilahi inilah puteraku buah hati dan belahan jiwaku kupersembahkan dia untukmu maka dekatkanlah dia dengan ayahnya
3013057 karenanya kumohon atas nama alloh janganlah engkau halangi aku untuk berjihad bersamamu insyaaalloh akulah asy syahid putra asy syahid aku telah hafal aku juga jago menunggang kuda dan memanah maka janganlah meremehkanku hanya karena usiaku yang masih belia
3013058 hai abu qudamah temuilah bocah itu ia sudah terlalu lama memasak ada apa dengannya
3013059 paman maafkan aku nampaknya aku terlambat menyiapkan makanan bagi kalian
3013060 sudah tinggalkan saja masakan ini biar aku yang menyiapkannya aku adalah pelayan kalian selama jihad
3013061 demi alloh engkau tidak kuizinkan menyiapkan apa apa bagi kami sampai engkau menceritakan kepadaku apa yang membuatmu tertawa sewaktu tidur tadi keadaanmu sungguh mengherankan
3013062 sudahlah tidak usah bertanya tentangnya ini masalah pribadi antara aku dengan alloh
3013063 paman dalam mimpi tadi aku melihat seakan aku berada di jannah kudapati jannah itu dalam segala keindahan dan keanggunannya sebagaimana yang alloh ceritakan dalam ketika aku jalan jalan di dalamnya dengan terkagum kagum tiba tiba tampaklah olehku sebuah istana megah yang berkilauan dindingnya dari emas dan perak terasnya dari mutiara dan batu permata dan gerbangnya dari emas di teras itu ada kerai kerai yang terjuntai lalu perlahan kerai itu tersingkap dan tampaklah gadis gadis belia nan cantik jelita wajah mereka bersinar bak rembulan
3013064 inilah calon suami al mardhiyyah ya dialah calon suaminya benar dialah orangnya
3013065 selamat datang hai wali alloh dan kekasih nya aku diciptakan untukmu dan engkau adalah milikku
3013066 wahai kekasihku dan tambatan hatiku semoga alloh menjauhkanmu dari segala kekejian urusanmu di dunia masih tersisa sedikit insyaaalloh besok kita akan bertemu selepas ashar
3013067 usai mendengar cerita si bocah yang indah tadi aku berkata kepadanya
3013068 tatkala kuperhatikan orang orang di sekitarku kudapati masing masing dari mereka mengumpulkan sanak kerabatnya di sekitarnya adapun si bocah ia tidak punya ayah yang memanggilnya atau paman yang mengajaknya dan tidak pula saudara yang mendampinginya
3013069 tidak tidak pernah ini justru pertempuranku yang pertama kali melawan orang kafir
3013070 wahai anakku sesungguhnya perkara ini tidak segampang yang engkau bayangkan ini adalah peperangan sebuah pertumpahan darah di tengah gemerincingnya pedang ringkikan kuda dan hujan panah wahai anakku sebaiknya engkau ambil posisi di belakang saja jika kita menang engkaupun ikut menang namun jika kita kalah engkau tidak menjadi korban pertama
3013071 auudzubillaah sungguh bukan begitu kita semua tidak berada di medan jihad seperti ini kecuali karena lari dari neraka dan memburu surga
3013072 hai orang orang beriman apabila kamu bertemu orang orang kafir yang sedang menyerangmu maka janganlah kamu membelakangi mereka mundur barangsiapa yang membelakangi mereka mundur di waktu itu kecuali berbelok untuk siasat perang atau hendak menggabungkan diri dengan pasukan lain maka sesungguhnya orang itu kembali membawa kemurkaan dari alloh dan tempatnya ialah neraka jahanam dan amat buruklah tempat kembvalinya itu
3013073 adakah paman menginginkan aku berpaling membelakangi mereka sehingga tempat kembaliku adalah neraka
3013074 wahai anakku ayat itu maksudnya bukan seperti yang engkau katakan
3013075 aku harus mencarinya dan menyelidiki keadaannya barangkali ia terbunuh terluka atau jatuh dalam tawanan musuh
3013076 saudara saudara tolong panggilkan pamanku abu qudamah kemari panggilkan abu qudamah kemari
3013077 segala puji bagi alloh yang masih menghidupkanku hingga aku dapat berwasiat kepadamu maka dengarlah baik baik wasiatku ini
3013078 paman usaplah darahku dengan pakaianku dan jangan engkau usap dengan pakaianmu
3013079 kemudian bocah itu berusaha menguatkan dirinya namun nafasnya mulai sesak dan bicaranya tidak jelas ia berusaha kedua kalinya untuk menguatkan dirinya dan berkata
3013080 paman demi alloh mimpi itu benar mimpi itu sekarang menjadi kenyataan demi alloh saat ini aku benar benar sedang melihat al mardhiyyah dan mencium bau wanginya
3013081 maka kulepaskan pakaiannya yang berlumuran darah lalu kuletakkan dalam sebuah kantong kemudian kukebumikan dia usai mengebumikannya keinginan terbesarku ialah segera kembali ke raqqah dan menyampaikan pesannya kepada ibunya
3013082 hai abu qudamah engkau datang hendak berbela sungkawa atau memberi kabar gembira
3013083 semoga alloh merahmatimu jelaskanlah kepadaku apa yang engkau maksud dengan bela sungkawa dan kabar gembira itu
3013084 jika engkau hendak mengatakan bahwa anakku telah gugur di jalan alloh dalam keadaan maju dan pantang mundur berarti engkau datang membawa kabar gembira untukku karena alloh telah menerima hadiahku yang telah kusiapkan untuk nya sejak tujuh belas tahun silam namun jika engkau hendak mengatakan bahwa anakku kembali dengan selamat dan membawa ghanimah berarti engkau datang untuk berbela sungkawa kepadaku karena alloh belum berkenan menerima hadiah yang kupersembahkan untuk nya
3013085 kalau begitu aku datang membawa kabar gembira untukmu sesungguhnya anakmu telah terbunuh fi sabilillah dalam keadaan maju dan pantang mundur ia bahkan masih menyisakan sedikit kebaikan dan alloh berkenan untuk mengambil sebagian darahnya hingga ia ridha
3013086 bukankah ini adalah pakaiannya dan ini surbannya lalu ini gamisnya yang engkau kenakan kepada anakmu sewaktu berangkat berjihad
3013087 ya alloh aku telah merelakan kepergian suamiku saudaraku dan anakku di jalan mu ya alloh kuharap engkau meridhaiku dan mengumpulkanku bersama mereka di jannah mu
3013088 maka kuketuk pintu rumahnya dengan harapan ia akan membukakan aku ingin memberinya sejumlah uang atau menceritakan kepada orang orang tentang kesabarannya sehingga kisahnya menjadi teladan akan tetapi sungguh ia tidak membukakanku ataupun menjawab seruanku
3013089 sungguh demi alloh tidak pernah kualami kejadian yang lebih menakjubkan dari ini

3013093 a poem begins as a lump in the throat a sense of wrong a homesickness a lovesickness

3013101 over the past six months pilgrims pride has taken a number of proactive steps to strengthen our competitive position amid a very difficult operating environment
3013102 these steps include the production cutbacks for the second half of fiscal 2008 the closure of a plant in north carolina and seven distribution centers and the consolidation of our tray pack operations in el dorado ark
3013103 with labor day approaching and no indication that the actions taken to date by pilgrims pride or other industry members are having a positive effect on selling prices for our products it is now clear that more significant decisive action is necessary in addition epas disappointing decision to reject the request for a partial waiver of the 2008 renewable fuel standard for corn based ethanol assures that high grain prices are here to stay for the foreseeable future while we had sincerely hoped to avoid further facility closures or consolidations we recognize that we must do everything in our control to pass along higher input costs we believe the actions announced today while painful are needed to position pilgrims pride to emerge from this down cycle as a much stronger more efficient competitor

3013111 can one prepare for missional church leadership at a seminary
3013112 i argue that we should not dispose of the seminaries and i argue this not just to insure i keep a job as a seminary professor i argue we need a sense of our history of orthodoxy of theology and scripture and sense of apostolicity an historical connection to the history that we pass down in christ but we should do this in a pedagogy that does not separate the learning from the field of practice the two should be in partnership we should do all of this in a pedagogy that is entwined with spiritual formation community and worship we need regular times when we bring those preparing for missional leadership together to combine formal study spiritual disciplines community and worship we need communities of christ missional churches where these missional leader candidates can live among and then learn watch and participate in some supervised ministry that is edifying a church body all the while carrying on a means to support themselves we need coursework that engages the theology and cultural issues of the situation we face in the new post christendom a combination of all these elements in a seamless relationship will prepare leaders to start lead and develop new missional communities

3013115 you know its true that you can get all the stuff you need to do in an 8 hour work day done in half the time if you want to
3013116 because i did it today between 2 00 and 6 00 i got eight hours worth of work done mostly because i just wanted to get home on time
3013117 you are an insightful and engaging presenter and your program far exceeded my expectations
3013118 i think the field could use a few rocks to spruce up the earthy tones maybe over there
3013119 despite how lovely this field is now i can not get out of my mind the image of a hundred dead staining this hill with their blood
3013120 was it a great and glorious battle that took place here
3013121 this battle was fought by a fool and many sons lost their lives to a ruthless enemy
3013122 you know spafford there is a legend that says crows are a sign of death
3013123 i wish they would just leave they have a tendency to peck at one such i really dont like it
3013124 if you say so but i still dont like them
3013125 he must have had a good reason for fighting as he did
3013126 it all started when a young prince decided to adventure in the valley of tumsrah several leagues west of here he awakened a great evil in his foolish quest for glory and now that evil has swept across the land in hope of conquering all that is good
3013127 my thought was to have an old sage who receives this vision about how to stop the forces of evil but no one listens to him and he has to build a rag tag group of adventures to complete the vision and fulfill the quest
3013128 the villain is the young crusading prince possessed by an evil sword
3013129 yeah and then he turns back to good when the sage and his band find phoenixs blood which is the only thing that can break the power of the sword
3013130 but also redundant and clich i dont know do i really want to write a fantasy story
3013131 yes i know its just that im looking for something that says me
3013132 if you dont get around to writing something then you will never write anything
3013133 you are an ink imp which if i may say is a unique creation and the fact that you are a good and helpful imp must be a rarity i mean you must have a rather interesting and peculiar story
3013134 i would love to tell the master my story but master has not given me a story yet
3013135 how long is it going to take the sun to set

3013144 still hebrews the royal book i call it isnt it grand
3013145 i was a young man with unformed ideas i threw out queries suggestions wondering all the time over everything and to my astonishment the ideas took like wildfire people made a religion of them
3013146 i have a summer house in the garden which holds about thirty people it is over there
3013147 i want you very much to speak there i know you read the bible in the villages to morrow afternoon i should like the servants on the place some tenants and a few of the neighbours to gather there will you speak to them

3013149 if you take the meeting at three oclock this window will be open and you will know that i am joining in with the singing
3013150 why did she wait until 1915 34 years after the event and in america before she told her story
3013151 there is no doubt that lady hope was making comments about darwin to her religious friends long before the story was published
3013152 how i wish i had not expressed my theory of evolution as i have done
3013153 had been with the darwin household as a nurse for many years
3013154 i used to feel when i saw him he would make a fine picture but never did i think so more strongly than on this particular occasion
3013155 in the other hand he held an open bible which he was always studying
3013156 he was almost bedridden for some months before he died
3013157 may have been absent on the day or days that she allegedly called
3013158 fegans reliability as a witness no less than lady hopes is open to question
3013159 the high standards of truth which the darwins inherited from their father a most honourable chivalrous and benevolent gentleman
3013160 desmond and moores picture of darwin and family in their book darwin desm is very different
3013161 he looked at me very hard and said well that often come over me with overwhelming force but at other times and he shook his head vaguely adding it seems to go away
3013162 on the future of humanity on the ground that in our civilisation natural selection had no play and the fittest did not survive
3013163 i was present at his deathbed lady hope was not present during his last illness or any illness i believe he never even saw her but in any case she had no influence over him in any department of thought or belief the whole story has no foundation whatever
3013164 p24 this could be particularly significant if lady hopes visit was unwelcome as we will see
3013165 never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a god
3013166 the impossibility of conceiving that this grand and wondrous universe with our conscious selves arose through chance seems to me the chief argument for the existence of god
3013167 a perplexing subject on which i have often thought but cannot see my way clearly
3013168 nothing can be said too severe upon the doctrine of eternal punishment for disbelief m 36
3013169 would not have tolerated anything so intrusive as personal evangelizing
3013170 thought much on the eternal questions chance and design providence and pain
3013171 i never gave up christianity until i was forty years of age
3013172 never had an unpleasant word with lady hope up to the end we were on friendly terms
3013173 a skilled raconteur able to summon up poignant scenes and conversations and embroider them with spiritual sentimentality
3013174 having made his fortune in pork larded the coffers of many evangelical enterprises
3013175 the man who wrung more revenue out of the madras plantations than any previous administrator
3013176 a gifted duo like their english contemporaries gilbert and sullivan
3013177 there is no doubt that lady hope was making comments about darwin to her religious friends long before the story was published
3013178 a lady in the part of kent that we have described started a coffee tent and took no less than eighty her emphasis pounds
3013179 having made his fortune in pork larded the coffers of many evangelical enterprises
3013180 had been the home of emma darwins charless wife allen aunts the darwins first cousin the rev john allen wedgewood still lived there
3013181 the position is odd as both his son and grandson deny his christianity
3013182 at the peak you could be seeing 60 to 100 meteors an hour
3013183 this is the one we look forward to every year

3013287 when the war kicked off my parents saw an opportunity to help out and give back to the u s
3013288 theyve both been to joint base balad and my mom just came back from bucca god bless her soul

3013291 i try to do good things so when people think of me they think better of all iraqi people
3013292 i was out on post checks when i met airman mohiadeen
3013293 i noticed his name and asked where he was from and he said baghdad
3013294 i think its really cool to see people who have immigrated to the u s serving their country especially when it means coming back to their homeland
3013295 we basically do crime scene investigations on bomb sites conducting post blast analysis to help us combat future attacks and track the ied cells where the deadly weapons originate
3013296 it was a little different coming into this environment dominated by soldiers but in the end we are all here for the same reason to serve our country
3013297 i do a lot of analytical work with the army intel guys and really enjoy the things i am getting to do here plus i get to do something for my fellow service members
3013298 there is no real difference between an airman and a soldier we are all professionals and take our work seriously

3013310 our client roster inspired us to launch this analysis series due to our customers unique positions in the advertising ecosystem they are us based but also global in the scope regarding their paid search advertising programs so they tend not to be retailers or ecommerce vendors who focus on one geographic region

3013312 pure bar is a great complementary strategic fit with the promax brand portfolio and we enthusiastically embrace this partnership pure bar is a fantastic brand experiencing strong growth and we are delighted to have veronica bosgraaf joining us to grow the business together

3013315 we estimate that 99 percent of data theft involving devices such as usb flash drives mp3 players and other storage media goes undetected many organizations both in the public and private sectors simply havent acknowledged the threat that comes from failing to control the flow of data to and from the corporate network via a pcs usb port or other local connections
3013316 we find that it managers who install devicewall are surprised at just how many device connections occur on their network every single day
3013317 without a solution to automatically record and manage these attempted data transfers it and business managers simply have no visibility into not only what data is leaving the organization but also what risks are being brought into the network

3013324 at the moment the pipeline is not running at any capacity because there was a fire
3013325 if you draw lines and give russia a free hand here it will never work
3013326 if russia is given a free hand it will extend to other parts of europe russia thinks it still has the right to interfere but we say to the europeans if there is any appeasement towards russia over the way it deals with us it will have repercussions for other countries
3013327 over the past few years i lived in a democratic society i was happy and now america and the european union are spitting on us

3013333 mr saakashvilli may also have banked on support from his closest ally us president george w bush whose administration is said to have given tacit support for a georgian assault on south ossetia in the believe that the territory could be recaptured within 48 hours
3013334 obama has criticized bush for his fiscal irresponsibility and now hes using bushs baseline as a yardstick by which to measure fiscal responsibility
3013335 congress hasnt agreed to extend the bush tax cuts because they dont have the money to pay for it

3013344 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3013345 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3013346 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3013351 i get to see sondra in x number of days
3013352 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3013353 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3013354 cuando la religi n y la pol tica van en el mismo coche los pasajeros creen que nada podr ponerse en su camino
3013355 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3013356 un rappel des br ves publi es sur le journal de bord
3013357 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3013358 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3013362 the 200 flys never easy but it wasnt a max swim i was going into it ranked sixth or seventh so i can reserve it a little bit for the semifinal
3013363 the aim was just to get through to the semifinals as long as im through im happy
3013364 weve done enough races now and ive got a good feel of the pace im going
3013365 i knew 1 55 1 56 would be enough to get through and thats how it felt i was doing as i was swimming along
3013366 its always a bit risky but if youre planning to get through to the final thats what we knew id have to do save a little bit
3013367 as i turned i saw i was a little bit behind those guys so i knew id have to pick it up a little bit yeah
3013368 four years ago in athens 2 13 would have been close to a medal so its pretty amazing that 2 13 doesnt even make the semifinals here

3013396 the crisp lines and the vibrant colours are very striking and this deserves a better score in the voting booth
3013397 the movement has survived even after the cold war and that shows it is politically relevant not only for its members but for the un as well
3013398 this means that you dont get to vote or decide but you have a good position for lobbying for your goals
3013399 the trick was revealed in a local chinese newspaper the beijing times at the weekend gao xiaolong head of the visual effects team for the ceremony said it had taken almost a year to create the 55 second sequence meticulous efforts were made to ensure the sequence was as unnoticeable as possible they sought advice from the beijing meteorological office as to how to recreate the hazy effects of beijings smog at night and inserted a slight camera shake effect to simulate the idea that it was filmed from a helicopter

3013403 today is the day that women everywhere will realize that i am their prince in shining armor

3013405 hi im just walking around meeting people whats your name
3013406 youre spoiled i dont blame you for that i would be too if i was a girl and most guys kissed my ass and acted like whipped wussies around me but just because your head is screwed up to the point where you dont have any decent social skills doesnt mean that i should tolerate your disrespectful mouth for even one second so if you want to spend time with me act like an adult
3013407 wow so whats it like being a redhead in a world that loves blondes

3013412 the iphone meets our minimum requirements and can be moved to the appliance support level which means support is limited to a narrow set of applications such as voice email personal information manager and browsing
3013413 consisting of a combination of alpha numeric and special characters in a pattern that cannot be easily guessed
3013414 must employ previously released methods such as imap internet message access protocol in the concierge support level or await third party products that can tie into the security policy features delivered with the firmware 2 0 upgrade
3013415 organisationally were heading towards migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3013416 the device can be wiped clean via the issuance of a standard instruction from exchange and can force the use of a complex password if the alphanumeric setting is checked on the exchange 2003 sp2 or 2007 administrative console
3013417 the iphone reacts similarly to a windows mobile device clearing contents when the security policy is violated
3013418 microsoft uses a confusing approach assuming that the end device will decide on what type of password will be enforced when the policy is received by the device there is no feedback to the console that the policy has been enforced windows mobile interprets the alphanumeric parameter as an instruction to force the user to employ a complex password the iphone replicates this function in the same manner despite microsofts awkward implementation
3013419 breathe due to the fact that they appear to have been painted or draw prior to the application of the paint in the planes leaving rough uneven edges behind the variation of line quality gives life to the geometric composition this is enhanced through what appears to be thin uneven application of the paint exposing previous layers of under painting two overlapping geometric forms are implied through the line work the central form seems to be a vertical structure with eschewed perspective the other seems reminiscent of ductwork one may find in an industrial setting red orange planes seem to follow what would be the left vertical plane of this second form but sometimes a line from one form overlaps another the color shifts complicating the spatial relationships and altering perspective my initial reaction to the painting when viewing it as a small preview in my email was that it was quite simple flat and the composition felt awkwardly static due to the distribution of color but i was delighted and rewarded by looking harder finding the play between color space and surface there is some good painting in there and i am looking forward to seeing more work from this artist untitled 22 oil on canvasboard 18
3013420 but there is no sense of how far the strawberry is from the wall behind it
3013421 the artist seems to have been more concerned with rendering rather than painting

3013426 die steigenden kosten bei der sozialhilfe sind ausdruck einer sozialen schieflage die antwort darauf kann nur das ende der umverteilung von unten nach oben und ein mehr an verteilungsgerechtigkeit sein
3013427 die steigenden ausgaben bei der grundsicherung im alter und bei erwerbsminderung der hilfe zur pflege sowie zum lebensunterhalt widerspiegeln die wachsende armut
3013428 die entsprechenden kosten rei en l cher in die kassen der kommunen zugleich verteilt der bund steuergeschenke an gro unternehmen und beteiligt hohe einkommen und verm gen nur m ig an der finanzierung der staatsausgaben da stimmt etwas nicht
3013429 dazu geh ren der als reform bezeichnete fortgesetzte sozialbbau und die anhaltende umverteilung von unten nach oben
3013430 das bewirkt auch in zukunft einen starken anstieg des gesellschaftlichen reichtums pro kopf eine gerechtere verteilung des erwirtschafteten volkseinkommens ist notwendig um soziale gerechtigkeit f r alle generationen zu sichern

3013435 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3013436 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3013437 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3013438 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages

3013445 for instance weve learned that when someone has a haploid insufficiency and is missing one copy of the tgf gene he or she is more vulnerable to environmental insults that can cause cleft palate such as drugs smoking and alcohol
3013446 we found that if we blocked tgf or the receptors a cleft palate develops
3013447 but when smad4 was blocked normal palate epithelium still covered the palatal shelf
3013448 this information is useful not just for palate and teeth but also for cancer and cell biology in general

3013464 theres no use in denying all these because too many people are involved in this and too many speak about it
3013465 the campaign comes with gifts of sarong prayer mat and cash between rm50 and rm100 while travel expenditures from all divisions luxury hotel accommodations and food and beverage while they delegates are in kuala lumpur are all paid for
3013466 meanwhile the president persuaded the deputy president datuk seri najib razak not to contest for the president post by offering him the presidency and the premiership in june 2010 this is clearly a form of bribe which shouldnt have been done by the umno president who had already forbid all kinds of bribery for the branch division and supreme council elections
3013467 all these are due to umnos corrupt leadership and members who dare not criticise them what more to act against them

3013556 online publishers are producing more inventory than the market demands and risk devaluing the premium nature of their brands particularly in light of ad networks growth and their dramatically lower pricing
3013557 building more effective relationships between publishers and ad networks is critical in the longer term both parties will benefit from gains in ad network cpms
3013558 what this benchmark study tells the industry is that there is a need for more sophisticated yield management on the part of premium publishers for stronger partnerships between publishers and ad networks for development of best practices and more focus on the value of interactive advertising
3013559 our industry is at an important juncture and now is the time for publishers to adopt strategic approaches to the use of ad networks who themselves have become critical players in the digital ecosystem

3013566 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3013567 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3013568 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3013571 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3013572 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3013573 here are the top 10 mistakes people make when they try to do x for the first time
3013574 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3013575 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
3013576 bases loaded and nobody out we have a chance to put it away and we didnt even hit the ball fair
3013577 working with lou and pitching coach stan boroski you just want to get out there and pound the zone early i felt pretty comfortable early
3013578 it was just pounding the zone and making them swing the bats theyre a pretty good hitting team and you just want to attack the zone and let your defense make plays
3013579 i had no idea what was going on at that moment in time those were the worst two innings of my life it was pretty frustrating especially when you walk the other pitcher on four straight pitches
3013580 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3013581 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3013582 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3013583 it doesnt look like this was premeditated with a massive staging of equipment
3013584 until the night before the fighting russia seemed to be playing a constructive role
3013585 im serious just replace all jokes about relations with handguns or fistfights and you have us

3013611 the era of smaller more fuel efficient vehicles is upon us
3013612 until recently motorcycles and scooters were considered the choice of enthusiasts or people who were just interested in fun and recreation but with gas prices dramatically rising we believe a growing number of consumers will be interested in buying or leasing motorcycles and scooters for extremely practical reasons with most motorcycles averaging from 40 to 60 miles per gallon and many scooters averaging up to 70 or more miles per gallon a lot of people are now interested in acquiring these vehicles for commuting to and from work and for local and mid distance transportation
3013613 it isnt necessarily that consumers are getting rid of their cars pickup trucks or suvs
3013614 rather its a case of people recognizing that there are real economical alternatives to the high cost of operating larger vehicles to which weve grown accustomed our staff has been hearing a lot of anecdotal commentary from our new customers that strongly reinforces the expectations weve had for over a year that a growing number of people would be moving to motorcycles and scooters because of the increasing price of fuel with the current average price of regular gas hovering just over 4 a gallon and with many analysts predicting continuing record high prices for the foreseeable future we anticipate continuing interest in powersport vehicles as a direct result of this trend
3013615 our analysis of the potential market for thyrotest indicates that it is much larger than the current estimated instance of hypothyroidism in the u s
3013616 the wide range of symptoms most of them very common in todays society opens what we view to be a significant opportunity for a screening device like thyrotest that is clia waived and therefore allowed to be used in a wide variety of testing venues we also believe that thyrotest is significantly superior to competitive products and our marketing strategy for the product will include providing data that supports this contention
3013617 to date the operations at the mine are going well while production from the mine has met mill capacity the mill has been plagued by a series of mechanical breakdowns and stoppages that reduced the daily average through put during the quarter from the average design capacity of 1 500 tpd to just under 1 200 tpd staff and contracted mill maintenance specialists have been reviewing operating and preventive maintenance practices and have made a number of changes with a view to achieving higher throughput on a sustained basis as the milling costs are essentially fixed costs higher mill availability will directly contribute to higher net earnings

3013623 our second quarter 2008 results are not just the result of record high commodity prices but increased production volumes from company properties the companys income from operations in the second quarter of 2008 exceeded the companys income from operations for the entire calendar year 2007 the company set records in the first six months of 2008 for all performance measures of revenues income earnings and production in july 2008 with the addition of the riffe field properties purchased from black diamond oil we have also set a new monthly oil production record by the company of more than 21 000 gross barrels our second quarter results do not include any volumes from the black diamond acquisition that was effective july 1 the beginning of the third quarter early third quarter results from the black diamond properties indicate that our daily produced volumes have increased by about 82 barrels per day from this new property we have drilled 6 wells since the beginning of 2008 resulting in 5 producing wells and 1 dry hole two of these wells were completed in july 2008 with production beginning in late july all of these six wells were drilled using the companys cash flow with no transfer of working interest in the wells required and we expect this to continue with future drilling in this period of high commodity prices one of our new oil wells the albers 1 well in trego county kansas appears to be an excellent well with initial production in the range of 50 barrels per day we believe this demonstrates that this area of trego county is one in which our investment in technology has produced favorable results the albers 1 is our fourth well in this area with the first three being dry holes that nevertheless provided the reservoir information we needed to best use our 3d seismic analysis we believe the company is well positioned to continue to benefit from current high oil prices and to continue to expand production volumes by additional kansas drilling

3013628 this is an exciting collaboration for us which will provide additional engineering capability in the development of a refrigeration engine that is cleaner and more fuel efficient the cost of operating diesel engines has been steadily rising as the price of oil increases this cost is beginning to be passed on to consumers and is already being reflected on the grocery shelves the transportation industry is therefore looking for a solution that will improve fuel and cost efficiencies whilst reducing emissions all of which would provide substantial monetary savings we believe we have that solution
3013629 we know there is demand across the transport sector for greater fuel efficiency and for improvements in the emissions levels of diesel engines our work on a next generation of steam engines will be allied with a means to capitalise on the previously wasted heat energy with clean power for refrigeration trailers while the technology is complex the solution which this collaboration aims to provide to meet this growing market need is simple

3013701 dies ist zum wiederholten male von seiten der polzei gewerkschaften eine populistische und oberfl chliche darstellung der dfb und die bundesliga vereine haben das gleiche recht wie alle anderen gesellschaftlichen gruppierungen dass die polizei bei ffentlichen veranstaltungen ihren dienstlichen verpflichtungen nachkommen muss
3013702 wenn sicherheit in deutschland davon abh ngt ob man sie bezahlen kann dann w re dies mehr als fatal bezahlte polizei eins tze bei veranstaltungen k men daher einer doppel und dreifach besteuerung f r den dfb gleich
3013703 der dfb ist ein sportverband der keinerlei ffentliche mittel f r die arbeit des verbandes und dessen ffentliche veranstaltungen in anspruch nimmt doch solchen argumenten und unserer grunds tzlichen position verschlie en sich die polizei gewerkschaften seit jahren konsequent statt dessen melden sie sich regelm ig mit ihren unbegr ndeten und effekthascherischen aussagen zu wort

3013728 many manufacturers are already increasing their focus on marketing and connecting with these markets through non traditional avenues like scholarships and supporting community activities

3013734 in the years weve been conducting this study weve never seen such dramatic year over year shifts in the rankings of the six domestic and foreign domestic automakers
3013735 this could signal a new chapter in oem supplier relations going forward
3013736 chryslers showing is especially unfortunate fifteen years ago chrysler was clearly ranked no 1 by suppliers but today has fallen rather dramatically to last place since being taken over by cerberus
3013737 last year gms largest suppliers indicated that they were sharing new technology without the assurance of a purchase order and investing in new technology in anticipation of future business to the greatest extent in many years because of improved relations with gm this year chryslers suppliers tell us that they have significantly pulled back in both of these areas because of worsening relations with chrysler
3013738 the two year drop of worsening supplier relations at chrysler has resulted in suppliers treating chrysler as chrysler has been treating them in todays poor economy and intense competitive environment such behavior toward suppliers by chrysler just doesnt make sense
3013739 now is not the time to take an adversarial approach to working with suppliers every automaker should be striving to work in a more trusting way with its suppliers so that it can take full advantage of the benefits they offer and strengthen its marketplace advantage suppliers simply respond in kind and chrysler is paying the price
3013740 supplier working relations within each oem vary among the various purchasing areas indicating that it is the oem personnel who have the day to day responsibility of working with suppliers who are the primary determinants of the companys supplier relations this indicates the importance of having performance metrics in place to drive the desired behavior of these individuals
3013741 the challenges of rampant increases in material costs poor economic conditions and increasingly intensive competition require that each oem works more closely than ever with its suppliers to maximize its chances for success
3013742 the turmoil in supplier relations among all of the oem implies that purchasing vps who know better have forgotten this fundamental premise of supplier relations
3013743 by putting in place performance metrics that drive the behaviors of the personnel who interface with suppliers the needed supplier relations will occur with the right performance metrics every oem can improve its supplier relations to the benefit of both itself and its suppliers
3013744 there is no doubt that economic and environmental factors are significantly changing which vehicles individuals buy and even more interestingly the types of vehicles they choose to purchase again
3013745 our data has shown that hybrid manufacturers have a clear advantage in reaching and keeping the more loyal vehicle buyers on the road today
3013746 from q1 2008 to q2 2008 unit sales for the 32 inch and 40 to 42 inch screen size segments were up 22 percent and 26 percent respectively
3013747 however it was the new 19w and 22w models launched in the second quarter that showed the real dramatic growth
3013748 unit sales for the 19w segment increased 121 percent quarter to quarter while the 22w segment was up 262 percent for the same time period

3013786 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3013787 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3013788 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3013789 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3013790 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3013791 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3013792 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3013793 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3013794 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3013795 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3013796 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3013797 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores

3013801 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3013802 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3013803 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3013804 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3013805 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3013806 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo
3013807 hice abundante cosecha de esqueletos y craneos en los cementerios de los indigenas sometidos que vivian en las inmediaciones del azul y en blanca grande
3013808 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
3013809 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
3013810 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
3013811 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
3013812 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
3013813 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente

3013817 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
3013818 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades

3013824 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
3013825 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
3013826 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar
3013827 el sector paraestatal continuar a siendo un riesgo para la exitosa implementaci n del presupuesto de 2002 03 las intervenciones del gobierno en la agricultura y otros mercados alimentarios est n socavando otras inversiones m s productivas
3013828 one must not hurry on such serious issues as serious mistakes can be made that have to be paid for a long time afterwards
3013829 there will be a residual effect of marketing efforts that will quickly taper off when marketing activities stop
3013830 during tight times the marketing must become more strategic in order to reach the people you want to reach when you want to reach them but not stopped
3013831 to accomplish this the marketing presence needs to be constant
3013832 good ways to begin marketing efforts are having a web site and mailings
3013833 well fitting partners allow leveraging each other to reach new audiences

3013852 i regret that some of our partners are not helping us but in fact are trying to impede us
3013853 it seems that this will not change anything but will move us away from resolving the situation
3013854 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3013855 more than 50 russian warplanes are flying over georgia tbilisi was bombed bombs hit the village of kojori and makhata mountain
3013856 the situation is very tense here this is a humanitarian catastrophe there is no water and the citys entire infrastructure is destroyed
3013857 the savings on the cost of managing a single system let alone a second backup system would be quite dramatic
3013858 the person at the other end has no idea whether theyre calling you at the office or if youre half a world away
3013859 we could lose half the country and wed still be in business

3013873 the fujifilm finepix z100fd is a good camera all around beyond its styling it never really stands out though it never fails terribly in any category either overall the z100fd is a solid camera that performed well if unremarkably for a compact point and shoot and even if its performance isnt always stunning the z100fd never lets fashion get in the way of function
3013874 the fully automatic auto and multiple scene modes make it a snap for anyone to use and manual mode gives more control to the experienced user combine that with the good quality images and you have a very attractive little package the only real problem we had with this model was the slower shooting performance with an msrp of us 250 this is a camera that you will be paying a little extra for the size and looks as their are other cameras that perform just as well if not better for a little less money
3013875 its not the fastest camera out of the speed blocks but it sure looks good complaints are the menu system is unnecessarily long and complicated and the lens is located so close to the top edge of the camera fingers have a way off accidentally getting in the picture while the photos are good the reviewer did notice a bit of purple fringing
3013876 high on style and features this camera takes reasonably good photographs and does it all for a price thats less than the competitors for the social photographer who find themselves in low light this cameras mechanical image stabilization and accurate low light focus could come in handy yet its not the fastest performer on the block and the battery like sucks literally
3013877 experienced photographers will be disappointed in the lack of manual controls but the reviewer was particularly impressed with the accuracy and efficiency of the face detection system image quality suffered in low light due to blurry photos caused by the camera selecting slower shutter speeds
3013878 not an outstanding camera with picture quality and performance average one nice aspect is the iso performance which even at 400 did not display a lot of digital noise even photo detail holds up color reproduction was a little on the strong side and actually the only time this was a concern when taking pictures of people
3013879 the fujifilm finepix z100fd is a surprisingly good point and shoot digital camera its stylish enough to appeal to the fashion conscious built well enough to survive a few bumps and scrapes and offers enough features to appeal to both beginners and more experienced photographers alike the 5x zoom lens in particular sets the z100fd apart from the vast majority of affordable compacts which usually offer a bog standard 3x zoom admittedly the z100fds lens isnt particularly wide at 36mm but youll really appreciate the longer telephoto range on offer fujifilm have sensibly added an effective mechanical image stabilisation system to ensure that the majority of your pictures will be sharp
3013880 in short the z100fd provides combinations of nice design and build good image quality and a range of clever and importantly truly useful features that work plus the great flash performance being a real stand out overall then the z100fd is good rather than great but still certainly worth a closer look particularly if you want a camera with slim and stylish build without the bulk
3013881 the finepix z100fd is the perfect social camera for the user looking for a combination of classic styling and cutting edge features we believe that consumers wanting a super slim camera shouldnt have to make compromises on image quality or features and with the z100fd they dont

3013931 unfortunately no professional organization has taken the initiative to provide guidance on this issue as the number of medical blogs grows professional organizations medical educators and the blogging community must address the challenge of this new medium by setting guidelines and standards for what is appropriate
3013932 clear representation of perspective readers must understand the training and overall perspective of the author of a blog certainly bloggers can have opinions on subjects outside of their training and these opinions may be true but readers must have a place to look on a blog to get an idea of where this author is coming from this also encompasses the idea of the distinction between advertisement and content this does not preclude anonymous blogging but it asks that even anonymous bloggers share the professional perspective from which they are blogging confidentiality bloggers must respect the nature of the relationship between patient and medical professionals and the clear need for confidentiality all discussions of patients must be done in a way in which patients identity cannot be inferred a patients name can only be revealed in a way that is in keeping with the laws that govern that practice hippa informed consent commercial disclosure the presence or absence of commercial ties of the author must be made clear for the readers if the author is using their blog to pitch a product it must be clear that they are doing that any ties to device manufacturer and or pharmaceutical company ties must be clearly stated reliability of information citing sources when appropriate and changing inaccuracies when they are pointed out courtesy bloggers should not engage in personal attacks nor should they allow their commenters to do so debate and discussion of ideas is one of the major purposes of blogging while the ideas people hold should be criticized and even confronted the overall purpose is a discussion of ideas not those who hold ideas

3013956 i recently read the blurb about soulja boy and his comments about his success where the teen rapper stated that he doesnt want to be respected for his music but will stick with the formula that has made him successful this is among the reasons he is not allowed in our home everyone is dancing to his music which trivializes sex among teenagers his misogynistic lyrics are being sung by toddlers and adults alike its disgusting and yet amusing because people dont even know what they are singing about soulja boy and his spouting of this trash should not be encouraged and his comments prove his ignorance and stupidity we have our young people giving in to this opinion that doing your best is nerdy and they should be teased for working to be a success and carry themselves with self respect soulja boys comments reflect how he does not want to be respected for his music but merely paid for the junk that he puts out and his producers call it music

3014005 we have a really good relationship with sony and its great to see the evolution of the platform i think its experienced a lot of evolution and in some places playstation 3 is definitely beating out xbox

3014016 but the most powerful secrets that live on manhunt arent the ones we keep from the outside world the most powerful secrets on manhunt are the ones we keep from ourselves practically every gay man has his own version of this secret which we learned to keep while growing up in the closet the secret fear that if we were truly known we would never be loved

3014024 enhances our control over the border allowing us to better deal with future illegal immigrants as well as drug traffickers and potential terrorists
3014025 at risk because that is that they are not here legally
3014026 im uneasy about these walls being built although i understand the american publics appetite for security
3014027 could result in some of our own citizens being denied full participation in our society and opportunities to improve english proficiency
3014028 w eve got to enforce our border thats our first and foremost priority but we also have to have a comprehensive solution and it has to be bipartisan and i believe were close to reaching that and thats what the american people expect us to do
3014029 building 700 miles of fencing along the most vulnerable sections of our southern border goes a long way toward securing the border and i hope we can use passage of this bill as a starting point toward long term comprehensive immigration reform
3014030 if you have twelve million people to thirteen to fourteen to fifteen million that are here illegally it is much easier for terrorists and drug dealers to hide
3014031 we should have a process where people can pay the penalties step up and accept responsibility for not being here legally
3014032 the objective is not to be punitive the objective is to make things right
3014033 face no penalty if they later apply to immigrate or visit
3014034 oppose amnesty or any other special path to citizenship for the millions of foreign nationals unlawfully present in the united states
3014035 we should scrap this comprehensive immigration bill and the whole debate until the government can show the american people that we have secured the borders or at least made great headway

3014080 if we can get onto the roof maybe we can lower him down somehow
3014081 its a thatch roof we could dig through it its not that difficult
3014082 look if we stand out here and wait whats going to happen we all know the crowds will rush in and yeshua will be long gone before we even manage to get the bed moved
3014083 but youre talking about ripping a hole in yeshuas roof
3014084 but im tired of watching elias get thinner and thinner every day because he cant eat im tired of looking at him and wondering how long before he dies im tired of dreaming about all the what ifs what if we had taken the new road what if we had left earlier and hadnt been in such a hurry what if i had been walking and elias had been steering what if it was me lying on that bed unable to so much as blink
3014085 im tired of sitting around wishing elias would just die
3014086 we climb up on the roof cut a hole and lower him down

3014090 i thought it was an okay game in terms of gameplay its not good but who wanted pro street it was a sort of made up put numbers on the side of your car and pretend to drive your ferrari where or your porsche where
3014091 for those of you who ever saw movies like the transporter its sort of a cult classic among people with a b movie mentality which fits me perfectly
3014092 i liked it i apologize for those of you with no taste and you liked it too we can go have a schlitz after this
3014093 last summer we added head count and split the team in two so now there are two teams on a 24 month cycle and this is sort of their first 16 and a half month game because we didnt do it far enough ago to give us a full two year dev cycle
3014094 we were torturing a very talented group of people up in vancouver which makes it harder to be as innovative every year so i think we are going to get better from here
3014095 im confident that undercover is a much better game than pro street and i expect that from this point forward they will do a lot better
3014096 i would like to dedicate my new six minute orchestral work the ascent to the life and creative work of gene roddenberry the idea is that of a climb to a mountain top the envisioning of making the climb the ascent and achievement of that goal all things roddenberry and star trek it was composed in the same dramatic narrative style as star trek it should fit well with the sprit of the night

3014131 this gene has been associated with a combination of kidney and eye disease in human patients
3014132 here we found a mutation that affects only the eyes suggesting that this gene might be a candidate for human patients with eye disease only
3014133 the new information that the nphp4 gene can be involved in eye diseases only can shed light on the etiology of some low frequency eye diseases in people where similar mutations may be involved
3014134 the experiments by our collaborators at the university of california san diego demonstrated that this mechanism is present and our theory explained why and how it happens

3014175 gas disks to gas giants simulating the birth of planetary systems
3014176 but we now know that these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
3014177 the shapes of the exoplanets orbits are elongated not nice and circular planets are not where we expect them to be many giant planets similar to jupiter known as hot jupiters are so close to the star they have orbits of mere days clearly we needed to start fresh in explaining planetary formation and this greater variety of planets we now see
3014178 such a turbulent history would seem to leave little room for the sedate solar system and our simulations show exactly that
3014179 conditions must be just right for the solar system to emerge
3014180 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed
3014181 we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
3014182 the solar system had to be born under just the right conditions to become this quiet place we see the vast majority of other planetary systems didnt have these special properties at birth and became something very different

3014200 rockets tend to work much better the hotter the exhaust is and the plasma allows you to go to temperatures millions of degrees rather than thousands of degrees in a conventional rocket engine
3014201 to harness the plasma at those temperatures the only way is to have a very strong magnetic field to hold it together the only way to create those fields in a reasonable way in space is with superconductors
3014202 we are at the end stages of agreeing a co operative agreement for nasa to test the vasimir engine on station

3014211 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3014212 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3014213 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3014214 there was a lot of contact with a lot of people
3014215 i think i must have gone off the track ten times and made contact with ten cars as well it was mayhem those races are good fun to drive in because its just non stop battling but theres no result to take away there was carnage at the first corner but i gained a few places and made some good moves in the first few laps i tried to press more but ended up touching with people or going wide because there was one dry line and it was difficult to go off it
3014216 were going to find out whether the internet is going to melt under the weight of video in a couple days he told between the lines this morning
3014217 they were freed only after about an hour and a half during which time the woman gave birth
3014218 the blame lies with the gauteng department of public works which cancelled lift maintenance contracts last year the call centre that has been set up for repairs doesnt work
3014219 the department would like to express regret for what the member of the public had to endure
3014220 i told him that he was lying and that it wasnt nice to joke about those kinds of things
3014221 but then the news of it slowly sunk in i just put the phone down and burst out crying
3014222 i couldnt go with them to identify the body i wanted to remember my brother just the way he was
3014223 we just feel like he lost his life for a cellphone its too heartsore
3014224 its still too raw for her and their two children
3014225 but now hes dead people even lay bunches of flowers on the pavement outside his home
3014226 the ticket sellers were supposed to be here pon sunday to sell weekly tickets to commuters but they did not arrive when the ticket sellers did not arrive the commuters got angry and started burning the buses
3014227 they wouldnt listen to us they forced everyone off the buses some drove them into the road and set the buses alight
3014228 putco sells weekly and monthly tickets to commuters and two weeks ago we suspended 17 ticket sellers after we discovered that money had been misappropriated
3014229 we got in replacement sellers but at the weekend they were intimidated and could not sell tickets
3014230 after this we sent a message to our commuters informing them that bus rides into town would be free this morning but somewhere there was a communication breakdown which led to buses being torched
3014231 apparently they got the wrong information about the tickets putco sent out a message stating no tickets were on sale so they could use the buses for free but someone sent out the wrong message
3014232 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
3014233 get outta there yer gunna get bitten by a snake
3014234 i am not saying everyone has to be christian this is not a homogenous nation
3014235 what you have to be is someone who believes in a judeo christian ethic in other words in knowing theres a right and wrong my lord made it very clear to me that im a cultural warrior for judeo christian values
3014236 we do not intend to argue the case based on proving animus
3014237 we said we werent going to argue animus until the judge reminded us that we needed to in order to fit the precedents we were citing
3014238 b y teaching students to reject scientific evidence and methodology whenever they might be inconsistent with the bible both texts fail to encourage critical thinking and the skills required for careful scientific analysis
3014239 reject the methodology generally accepted in science which relies on observation and experimentation and on the formulation of laws and theories that need to be tested rather than accepted on the basis of the bible or any other authority

3014266 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3014267 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3014268 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3014269 boris becker und sandy meyer w lden haben sich gestern im engsten familienkreis auf sardinien in porto cervo verlobt
3014270 ich bitte sie um verst ndnis dass es zum jetzigen zeitpunkt hierzu keine weiteren statements von herrn becker gibt
3014271 our goal is to educate property owners that property even if it is vacant is an asset to the community and must be maintained for a variety of reasons fire safety being the most critical at the moment
3014272 overgrown weeds and brush on vacant lots in a dry season are a fire hazard
3014273 last year during the week of fourth of july the san francisco fire department responded to 84 fires that were caused by grass or trash each time we respond to an outside fire we are using resources that would otherwise be available to respond to medical emergencies in the surrounding area
3014274 if property owners ignore their legal responsibility in keeping their land clean their property becomes a liability to those who live in the neighborhood and can sometimes become a fire hazard
3014275 abandoned property purchased through a marion county tax sale is typically sold as is often leaving the buyer to pay off tax and other liens but a home purchased from the indy land bank comes with a clean ownership title free of such liens
3014276 under state law the county is required to bid on and receive tax delinquent properties at auction developers community housing corporations cdcs and the city of memphis housing and community development division usually take the properties that have potential for renovation or redevelopment
3014277 we need something thats going to do something in a more massive aggressive way to streamline the process
3014278 the bottom line is that the city has an idea as to how it needs to help reduce the number of vacant boarded up homes in baltimore
3014279 this is just one more of the tools that the city needs to try to reduce this humongous number of vacant and boarded up houses
3014280 i respect those who rise above it wake up each day work and smile
3014281 how do i train my dog not to bark at people
3014282 public sale in which articles are sold to the highest bidder
3014283 after a highly successful show in 2007 amcon is returning to fort lauderdale to help contract manufacturers and job shops tap into the thriving high tech manufacturing market in south florida
3014284 im dragging through the day im exhausted when i get home from work i feel like going straight to bed but when i do i cant really sleep i must be coming down with something
3014285 well i think if you were going to come down with something you would have already
3014286 reverse racism dont even get me started on that put the pieces of the puzzle together
3014287 well black people use the n word all the time
3014288 it makes things run faster and smoother and gives us judges more confidence that people know whats going on
3014289 the difference in the system now is so huge i honestly have trouble going back to what it was like and i dont want to
3014290 research has shown that after a half an hour mental fatigue sets in and you start to lose proficiency
3014291 its a constitutional right for anyone facing loss of liberty
3014292 they have a right to understand the charges and what the process is
3014293 it only works if everyone in the system knows whats going on if they dont its not due process and its not fair
3014294 it takes more than one tool to build a house
3014295 it makes it more visible because without the web site no one may have known about the program
3014296 when i first moved here i wasnt sure about the neighborhood
3014297 its not the kind of neighborhood i would want to raise a kid in
3014298 we are interested in internet businesses which will be more important in the future
3014299 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3014300 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3014301 because this is a prepaid card the customer pays no interest on their balance
3014302 the difference with this card is that cordoba financial group does not earn any interest on the balance either
3014303 setting up a sharia financial company has been a great pleasure for us although we have taken a david and goliath approach
3014304 the trust we have garnered from our sharia advisers is something that money cant buy as is the trust we are going to engender with our customers
3014305 this is another product offered by london which as you all know is the islamic financial centre of europe
3014306 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on us russian relations

3014331 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
3014332 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
3014333 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
3014334 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital
3014335 shes devastated however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her
3014336 they had 30 years of marriage thats unprecedented in todays time particularly for celebrities that brings joy to her they loved each other and respected each other on a daily basis she was by his side to the very end
3014337 when they started dating he said girl you better come on board this train because im going to be rich and her response was okay and they were married thats how he charmed her with his sense of humor
3014338 when they got married they were kids he was 20 and she was 19 they both grew up together and they both matured in this marriage
3014339 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly
3014340 family members believe at this point it is a medical condition that might have led to his death
3014341 he was an equal cornerstone to the evolution of hip hop whats come to be known as r amp b and urban music in general
3014342 so theres absolutely no doubt that isaac hayes will be truly missed and he was a very influential part of music as we hear it today
3014343 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3014344 after laying the groundwork for the memphis soul sound through his work with stax records his groundbreaking theme song and score for the movie shaft cemented his status as a musical icon
3014345 the world has lost a true creative genius and a passionate humanitarian but his indelible legacy will remain ever present
3014346 our deepest sympathies go out to his family friends and all who were inspired by the man and his music
3014347 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that

3014371 actually the leadership wants that instead of being impeached by the parliament if he himself resigns then that will be comparatively advisable for him
3014372 impeachment can be long and drawn out it can lead to confrontations within the political arena that i do not think pakistan can afford i think that it can also raise issues that are best not discussed in the political arena i think it would be very hard to have a smooth process of impeachment

3014381 i needed to stay with him to be close enough to try to make a move in a braking zone we never could get close enough to get an opportunity
3014382 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
3014383 i knew that he was going to be good we both came in together and left together and that was probably the win right there to be able to beat him off pit road once we did that i kind of got up through the esses better than him and we pulled away
3014384 it was a big hit for a bunch of guys
3014385 we were ready to attack i know with nine to go you get up on the wheel and push hard pushing and shoving is ok but that was crazy i guess there wasnt much place to go they kept pushing and shoving
3014386 i knew getting a good start was going to be good and once i got that then it changed all my worries
3014387 sorry about that guys i dont know what happened i must have pulled it loose

3014398 it is realized that the league is incapable of rendering material aid and that the moral influence which may be a powerful force with civilized countries is unlikely to make any impression upon soviet russia
3014399 while america considers georgia its strongest ally in the bloc of former soviet countries washington needs russia too much on big issues like iran to risk it all to defend georgia
3014400 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
3014401 unfortunately not everything has gone as expected as shes had many other things on her mind not least rehearsals for her sticky amp sweet tour
3014402 on top of all the stress of this she twisted her ankle over the weekend she views this as a sign that perhaps she should postpone the formal birthday bash and play it by ear instead
3014403 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
3014404 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3014405 he couldnt have been a nicer guy he just seemed like a real family man and just a nice guy on the set just very kind of normal guy
3014406 this is the mystery couple believed to have been seen with madeleine mccann three days after she vanished
3014407 we should be working with our european partners and making clear that what russia has been doing and is doing is completely unacceptable what russia has done is use massive and disproportionate force it is acting as a dangerous bully i think theres a simple point here the only language that bullies understand is when someone stands up to them think of the implications for the baltic states are we going to allow russia to behave in this way in relation to other countries what russia is doing is disproportinate and is despicable
3014408 i think part of the problem here is that nato was rather unclear over whether georgia could have accelerated membership i think that if georgia was a member of nato wed have greater leverage over how it behaved we need to speed up nato membership lets be clear that it is russia who has violated georgias territory there are very worrying consequences if europe doesnt act nato doesnt act and speak clearly with one voice
3014409 anything that pushes the envelope and gets people to try new beer styles is a good thing
3014410 theres a more limited acceptable flavor profile for sour than for bitter

3014412 i decided to switch to one of these last november because it has a free bios program and no other laptop in the world that i knew of was available without a proprietary bios program
3014413 it took several months to arrange for us to get a machine and then for me to switch to it as i was switching in april the head of that project announced his betrayal of our community
3014414 the machines supposed to lead millions of children to freedom
3014415 but instead i fear it will lead millions of children under the dominion of microsoft
3014416 its completely misguided to try to make something a big success if its doing a bad thing
3014417 proprietary software subjugates the user its an injustice and the idea that its good to get people using computers regardless of everything else is shallow and misguided its better not to use computers than to use proprietary software

3014431 online publishers are producing more inventory than the market demands and risk devaluing the premium nature of their brands particularly in light of ad networks growth and their dramatically lower pricing
3014432 building more effective relationships between publishers and ad networks is critical in the longer term both parties will benefit from gains in ad network cpms
3014433 what this benchmark study tells the industry is that there is a need for more sophisticated yield management on the part of premium publishers for stronger partnerships between publishers and ad networks for development of best practices and more focus on the value of interactive advertising
3014434 our industry is at an important juncture and now is the time for publishers to adopt strategic approaches to the use of ad networks who themselves have become critical players in the digital ecosystem

3014438 every single week andy went over to see sawyer to do something with him
3014439 hed take him out to the movies crutches and all
3014440 he wanted to show that life is fleeting and that the only thing that can really satisfy us is eternity and christs love
3014441 he was a friend of guys who liked to party a friend of spiritual people a friend of kids a friend of senior adults
3014442 everyone would say i want a piece of what this guy has
3014443 he wasnt the prototypical homecoming king blown back sandy blonde hair and 14 inch biceps
3014444 people loved him for the size of his heart not his external qualities

3014452 so teachers with no training are allowed to fill vacancies through programs like tfa and nyc teaching fellows do they have programs like that for nurses
3014453 no i guess people would die if nurses werent trained it would be too dangerous it would become a liability issue
3014454 who is liable when students dont receive an adequate education

3014456 physics is changing the industry we evaluated all of the commercial physics systems out there for gaming and the choice was easy
3014457 nvidia physx runs faster than other solutions and it works across pcs and consoles which is important to us because bionic commando will ship on all major platforms we believe physx will help make the game seem even more lifelike and immersive
3014458 the gaming industry and gamers themselves are excited to see the return of bionic commando the addition of physics effects using physx technology is going to add a huge amount of extra fun and depth to the game play
3014459 we cant wait to see what the talented team at capcom and grin can create using the nvidia physx technology and hands on support from our developer technology team

3014505 this set of publications will prove useful to the library as we prepare a comprehensive plan for the preservation and conservation of library materials
3014506 the librarys collections number more than one million volumes some of which date back to the establishment of the college in 1794
3014507 the books received through the connecting to collections bookshelf award will provide information on preservation and conservation that will help librarians assess the physical condition of our collections and to institute best practices for the optimum preservation of these valuable scholarly resources for use by todays and future generations of scholars
3014508 we are very pleased to announce the recipients of the imls bookshelf in the second round of competition
3014509 these libraries museums and archives are in the forefront of our call to action on behalf of americas collections
3014510 according to a recent national survey our important collections are at great risk and without them the american story simply cannot be told to future generations

3014527 this unique structure aligns the interests of the independent trust management and regulators with the policyholders
3014528 it is a balanced solution for all of consecos constituents including cshis approximately 142 000 long term care policyholders and provides conseco greater flexibility in serving its 4 million other policyholders
3014529 most of cshis long term care business came as a result of consecos acquisition of insurance companies 11 years ago
3014530 conseco has worked diligently since then to stabilize that business by contributing 915 million in capital and installing experienced management our efforts have produced significant improvements in performance and customer service over the past four quarters
3014531 following the closing senior health will be operated for the benefit of cshis long term care policyholders without a profit motive so as to ensure that any future benefits from rate increases or policy changes will accrue to policyholders cshis existing capital and a final contribution of additional capital by conseco at the time of separation will be available to support those long term care policyholders in addition to cshis current policy reserves at the closing conseco will contribute 175 million principally in cash and notes to cshi and the independent trust bringing cshis total adjusted statutory capital to approximately 300 million
3014532 a man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life
3014533 i think our bigger fear was that we didnt want to offend any religious people but looking at the discussion that unfolded from this thing what we had was a good sizeable group of players that we might call militant atheists and the rest of the players seemed very tolerant including all of the religious players
3014534 i didnt expect to hit hot buttons on the atheist side as much i expected it on the religious side
3014535 but so far ive had no critical feedback at all from anybody who is religious feeling that we were misrepresenting religion or it was bad to represent religion in the game it was really the atheists
3014536 we have a number of team members that are pretty religious
3014537 and so in design on the team in our small little microcosm of players out there we tried our best to make sure we werent overtly offending any religious people but yet we wanted to include the idea the concept of religion in the game
3014538 we didnt want to go too far down that path we leave the whole creation of the universe question open
3014539 obviously as the player youre coming in and playing something like a god directing the evolution of a species but we never really state who you the player are
3014540 really great even better than what that thomas guy had probably created whoever he was

3014555 where you have a lot of players connected through content but its not synchronous its asynchronous interactions
3014556 the biggest benefit i saw from that was the possibility of having a collaboratively built world thats huge and always surprising
3014557 so for spore we tried to figure out how do we get the best aspects of a massively multiplayer game without all these huge design limitations
3014558 when you design a massively multiplayer online game you have to bite off a lot of major design limitations like nobody can pause the game nobody can cheat you usually have to pay a subscription
3014559 i think a lot of these limitations were what sank the sims online we didnt have enough user created content to a lot of the people that were playing the sims the idea of paying a subscription was a really big filter a lot didnt even have credit cards
3014560 thats not to say that one day we might not do a massively multiplayer online version of it but its just not the most interesting initial unveiling of it for me

3014564 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s we should require that u s taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects
3014565 iraqis have had little incentive to spend their own money given the willingness of the united states congress to keep writing blank checks

3014582 if the point of the story was to allege that mccain had an affair with a lobbyist wed have owed readers more compelling evidence than the conviction of senior staff members but that was not the point of the story the point of the story was that he behaved in such a way that his close aides felt the relationship constituted reckless behavior and feared it would ruin his career

3014629 that was not what i said what i said is that it would be important for people in the industry to be there helping make decisions
3014630 we dont drive wind cars no solar cars no nuclear cars
3014631 its too simplistic because the amount of oil available depends on the price
3014632 but that was at 2 a barrel oil and then the price went to 12 and so we found other supplies and then the price went to 20 and we found other supplies we have found so many reserves that we did not know we had
3014633 you got 100 percent of greenhouse gases you know what percentage of the greenhouse gasses are carbon five percent you know how many of those five are actually human induced one percent
3014634 keep in mind the argument on global warming is that over 100 years weve had a one degree increase in temperature but you know what the temperature did this year
3014635 it plunged ice for the first time in vietnam in history
3014636 the polar ice caps have been shrinking over the past few years from 5 million square miles down to one and a half million in one winter this last winter it burst back to 5 million so all the concern that were doing away with the habitat for the polar bear suddenly the argument is gone
3014637 china is building 544 new coal fired power plants so were giving up american jobs i do not want to contaminate i dont want to pump carbon out
3014638 but i also want to keep in mind that were giving away jobs for no purpose and so i would ask your readers are you willing to give up your job for the one tenth of one percent that we can affect
3014639 you know why the science is the way it is because we give out billions in grants and to get a grant you have to be on the side of global warming so we rig the science
3014640 we have to be able to affect the market price
3014641 and to do that we have to produce more of our energy so no we cannot wean ourselves off of foreign oil but we can lessen our demand to the point that it hurts foreign suppliers and they begin to respond with more production
3014642 allow the navajo people to tap into abundant resources to produce new domestic energy for america
3014643 put out large amounts of mercury ozone sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides which have been linked to significant health problems
3014644 i trust that the environmental protection agency is doing their job
3014645 should we have a lower standard of living myself im not willing to make the commitment to give that away
3014646 tom udall has opposed nuclear no matter what he says
3014647 to sign on that he would help me locate a nuclear reactor in new mexico and if no then where mccain is saying lets build 45 new reactors would he sign a letter to encourage that
3014648 they came right through the gulf coast where there are thousands of off shore platforms
3014649 do you know how much the price of oil dropped in one day
3014650 we have a kind of a counterculture that says that we got to get off that dirty stinkin oil and off that dirty stinkin coal
3014651 knows that nuclear is part of our energy future and we must also increase domestic oil drilling and production crack down on hedge fund speculation dramatically increas e fuel efficiency standards for automobiles and mak e serious investments in alternative energy

3014653 they poked us and stabbed us with the machetes and they were asking for money specifically dollars
3014654 we had a few quetzales guatemalas currency but we had no dollars with us on the boat
3014655 i said we need help i said my husband was not moving
3014656 i couldnt believe this was happening in front of me
3014657 to me it seemed to be happening in slow motion
3014658 my wife and i have come to reside in england
3014659 i thought i would be able to prove my innocence and receive justice which is why i returned to thailand on feb 28 but the situation has deteriorated
3014660 it could be a recycled pager it could be a number of things were just going to look at why someone else would have that number and why they would be paged by us
3014661 we just want to make sure its not going to reoccur
3014662 it would be for me personally something i just couldnt live with if she had to die because i made a mistake
3014663 its important to have public safety but i also think preserving life is a very important thing that most people in society would support it is for me in any case
3014664 she is a dog that was neglected a long time and i think she needs another chance i believe that i can give her that chance with the support of the city and the consent of animal services and make her into a better citizen
3014665 if there is a proven track record that the animal does show a propensity to attack and potentially the owner cannot control the dog thats when we would lead to the warrant to seize the dog
3014666 youre an idiot for not showing up at a test that you didnt know was happening in a school district where we do everything in the most illogical way possible to screw with your head
3014667 when it started it wasnt very big but once it got going it was a couple stories
3014668 the small car was sideways at that point and hit in the drivers side
3014669 at this point its the most feasible piece of evidence that we do have in custody
3014670 compensation paid by an employer to an individual who is on active duty in the uniformed services for a period of more than 30 days that represent all or a portion of the wages the individual would have received from the employer if the individual had remained in active employment with the employer
3014671 so it is war we know who our is enemy but we encourage everybody in the world freedom is worth fighting for
3014672 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
3014673 trust yourself create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement
3014674 the real contest is always between what youve done and what youre capable of doing you measure yourself against yourself and nobody else
3014675 it took a long time to pin the whole thing down
3014676 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac
3014677 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family
3014678 we believe we could have proven dr ivinss guilt beyond a reasonable doubt we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury

3014693 claims that we can make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media
3014694 our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is
3014695 if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously
3014696 the issues were raised when a visit was carried out by council officials on behalf of the health and safety executive they were looking at the building and its use in relation to the dangers that might be present in a workplace which is not comparing like with like in my humble opinion the most contentious item was the pulpit and there was no way the church authorities were going to allow a horrible plastic and metal handrail to be installed so we had to try an alternative tack in my professional capacity i knew the type of things that needed to be said to reassure the inspectors and the way in which they should be expressed fortunately my safe system of work pamphlet was successful and normal service has been resumed although i must admit even my faith was sorely tested at one stage

3014723 to date the operations at the mine are going well while production from the mine has met mill capacity the mill has been plagued by a series of mechanical breakdowns and stoppages that reduced the daily average through put during the quarter from the average design capacity of 1 500 tpd to just under 1 200 tpd staff and contracted mill maintenance specialists have been reviewing operating and preventive maintenance practices and have made a number of changes with a view to achieving higher throughput on a sustained basis as the milling costs are essentially fixed costs higher mill availability will directly contribute to higher net earnings

3014727 these new drill intercepts on the south wall discovery continue to demonstrate the potential for a large high grade polymetallic copper zinc and lead with gold and silver deposit with two drills now working on the south wall target we expect to be able to accelerate progress on this exciting new discovery
3014728 9 125 debentures due 2014 issued under the 1994 indenture
3014729 both drill site locations have been built and we are tentatively scheduled to begin drilling operations for these two locations in next 6 weeks
3014730 there are at least 5 different conventional reservoirs of interest in this area for potential oil and or gas production and these two locations are off sets to known producing wells
3014731 our second quarter 2008 results are not just the result of record high commodity prices but increased production volumes from company properties the companys income from operations in the second quarter of 2008 exceeded the companys income from operations for the entire calendar year 2007 the company set records in the first six months of 2008 for all performance measures of revenues income earnings and production in july 2008 with the addition of the riffe field properties purchased from black diamond oil we have also set a new monthly oil production record by the company of more than 21 000 gross barrels our second quarter results do not include any volumes from the black diamond acquisition that was effective july 1 the beginning of the third quarter early third quarter results from the black diamond properties indicate that our daily produced volumes have increased by about 82 barrels per day from this new property we have drilled 6 wells since the beginning of 2008 resulting in 5 producing wells and 1 dry hole two of these wells were completed in july 2008 with production beginning in late july all of these six wells were drilled using the companys cash flow with no transfer of working interest in the wells required and we expect this to continue with future drilling in this period of high commodity prices one of our new oil wells the albers 1 well in trego county kansas appears to be an excellent well with initial production in the range of 50 barrels per day we believe this demonstrates that this area of trego county is one in which our investment in technology has produced favorable results the albers 1 is our fourth well in this area with the first three being dry holes that nevertheless provided the reservoir information we needed to best use our 3d seismic analysis we believe the company is well positioned to continue to benefit from current high oil prices and to continue to expand production volumes by additional kansas drilling
3014732 the second quarter results demonstrate the significant growth of excel following the acquisition of quintana even though quintanas results are not fully reflected in the second quarter 2008 results the acquisition has completely transformed excel in terms of growth prospects as well as cash flow security the recent minimum dividend guidance of 0 40 per share is a reflection of excels strong financial position we are all very optimistic for our future performance despite the recent market volatility the significant time charter cover inherited from quintana provides a stable platform for us to enhance our performance and enhance returns for our shareholders in the future
3014733 post merger excels combined fleet is deployed in a more balanced employment approach we are taking advantage of the positive rate environment to expand our charter coverage for 2009 and beyond to secure consistent cash flows and ongoing profitability to our shareholders while at the same time we are benefitting from operating certain part of our fleet under short term period charters or in the spot market
3014734 we are pleased to help forge this new alliance between standard chartered bank nigeria and lapo which will help to fuel lapos expansion into southwest and eastern nigeria thus giving more poor nigerians access to financial services and financial security
3014735 this is the largest portfolio financing support lapo has received so far from a commercial bank it has great implications for our efforts to reach a large number of female owners of microenterprises across the country
3014736 the grameen foundation standard chartered bank nigeria lapo financing is a bold statement on the institutional strength of lapo as well as in the enormous potential of the nascent nigerian microfinance sector
3014737 the bank focuses on activities that not only enhance our business performance now and for the long term but also enhance the economic development of the countries we operate in have a positive impact on the environment and society as well as contribute to good governance i am quite proud of this tripartite partnership with grameen foundation and lapo which has given us the opportunity to provide major support for nigerias microfinance sector
3014738 this is an exciting collaboration for us which will provide additional engineering capability in the development of a refrigeration engine that is cleaner and more fuel efficient the cost of operating diesel engines has been steadily rising as the price of oil increases this cost is beginning to be passed on to consumers and is already being reflected on the grocery shelves the transportation industry is therefore looking for a solution that will improve fuel and cost efficiencies whilst reducing emissions all of which would provide substantial monetary savings we believe we have that solution
3014739 we know there is demand across the transport sector for greater fuel efficiency and for improvements in the emissions levels of diesel engines our work on a next generation of steam engines will be allied with a means to capitalise on the previously wasted heat energy with clean power for refrigeration trailers while the technology is complex the solution which this collaboration aims to provide to meet this growing market need is simple
3014740 voith turbo gmbh amp co kg has the outstanding engineering capability to undertake development of very specialized and complex technologies we are confident that this collaboration will produce an engine that will be one of the most fuel efficient and least polluting engines available on the market

3014766 i am extremely enthusiastic about the opportunity to help doral energy grow and become a significant independent operator
3014767 the opportunities for a company like doral focused on aggregating and exploiting under developed assets are among the most attractive in the domestic oil and gas market with an emphasis on strong operational management and prudent financial strategy i believe doral is in the right business at the right time

3014810 not at all that was our impartial and probably unanimous judgment we saw attorneys hold back tears and weep alongside their clients we saw judges prosecutors clerks and marshals do their duty sometimes with a heavy heart but always with a particular solemnity not accorded to the common criminals theyre used to encountering
3014811 your honor i am concerned from my attorney client interviews that many of these people are clearly not guilty yet they have no choice but to plead out
3014812 you know i dont agree with any of this or with the way it is being done in fact i ruled in a previous case that to charge somebody with identity theft the person had to at least know of the real owner of the social security number
3014813 as a citizen i want our judges to administer justice not a federal agency when the executive branch forces the hand of the judiciary the result is abuse of power and arbitrariness unworthy of a democracy founded upon the constitutional principle of checks and balances

3014853 gab2 is a signalling protein which means that its involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior of the cell instructing it to do specific things such as divide or migrate
3014854 gab2 performs a number of signalling roles in normal cells throughout the body and is usually switched off when its not needed our task has been to work out how the body switches off gab2 so that we can mimic that process in abnormal cells
3014855 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals
3014856 this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
3014857 as gab2 plays key roles in signalling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms
3014858 for the first time weve used rnai to dramatically suppress hiv infection in an organism
3014859 apparently the sirnas kept hiv from entering most t cells and kept it from replicating when it managed to slip inside
3014860 im not saying weve developed tomorrows therapy but this is a major step forward
3014861 weve used a small animal model for hiv and proven that rnai works in that model
3014862 the number one problem with the current antiretroviral drug regimens is toxicity
3014863 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment these results challenge current practice as endorsed by a national guideline in the uk

3014865 we know that testosterone makes males more susceptible to disease
3014866 we wanted to find out if it impacts their behavior as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease

3014877 we gave you but a feeble image of our comparative insignificance when we said that the glories of an extended forest would suffer no more from the fall of a single leaf than the glories of this extended universe would suffer though the globe we tread upon and all that it inherits should dissolve

3014887 do not do anything to him now i know that you fear god because you have not withheld from me your son your only son
3014888 on the mountain of the lord it will be provided

3014919 when we come to such a beautiful country remembering the tragedy that befell it thinking of what is happening back home we seem like we do not exist
3014920 rwanda is one good example we dream of and think we should emulate
3014921 people were commenting back home that what was in rwanda in 1994 left and went to burundi but we can not just criticize we instead have to continue visiting each other in order to learn from each other

3014947 you know the expression the stock market climbs a wall of worry short interest is part of that wall
3014948 without some pessimism there arent enough buyers left to fuel the market in 1999 and 2000 short selling was at record lows while the market was at its peak right now we have a tremendous amount of short selling in the market that leads us to think that were at the bottom
3014949 when you short it at some point it has to be purchased back one of the only examples in the stock market when buying has to set in
3014950 it has obviously been dangerous to be long on equities this year and contrarians have been hammered
3014951 given the bearish consensus view and the magnitude of short interest the bar to trigger short covering appears low

3014990 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
3014991 we have strayed so far from what made owning a home an unassailable american value
3014992 maybe we should rethink what it means to own your own home
3014993 we could think of it as a source of emotional security instead of a collateral security
3014994 she did everything a woman of her generation was supposed to do to earn economic security in her golden years not least of which was moving from being a renter to investing in a home more than 10 years ago
3014995 now shes back to being a renter having lost the house
3014996 behavioral economists and psychologists see some classic behaviors at play here leading to herds of people taking measures dumping stock lining up outside banks when they dont need to that can actually exacerbate the problems for everyone causing tornado like spirals that suck in even wider swaths of people
3014997 retirement accounts should be placed off limits except for dire circumstances first house or college is not dire potential life threatening illness and loss of job are the only reasons anyone should tap their account relying on the government to support someone in retirement is not viable anymore we must fund our own my wife and i max out contributions to all of our retirement accounts and have no intent to tap them at all until we need them for retirement
3014998 i appreciate the flexibility of borrowing against a 401 k
3014999 my wife and i have used this option to fund short term cash flow and paid ourselves back in 12 24 months and perhaps more importantly we generally find it comforting to know that the borrowing option is always there should we find ourselves in need of emergency funds
3015000 there isnt enough money and at the rate prices are rising there never will be its dirt simple to write stories about the individual issues and point out that were not saving enough or were irresponsibly borrowing from our 401ks or that weve not saved enough for the childs education piece of cake very hard though to come up with a complete picture of how most middle americans ought to navigate the financial shark infested waters of the new century

3015003 these people dont want variable annuities they want air conditioning and cars and theyre competing for the same resources
3015004 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3015005 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3015006 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3015007 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3015008 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3015009 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3015010 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3015011 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials
3015012 it is a measure of his extraordinary performance that the void created by his premature retirement in 1976 proved hard to fill by his successors a hardship which led to the daily times eventual collapse

3015077 there are two dangers that arise from giving prominence to the independence issue
3015078 firstly it might revive the slippery slope argument according to which if you give the assembly greater powers you are inevitably on a slippery slope to independence
3015079 i say this is total rubbish if there is an appropriate metaphor i would liken getting more powers for the assembly to an arduous climb up a mountain with all sorts of obstacles along the way
3015080 as you reach the upper slopes a number of alternative options appear and you may choose not to go all the way to the summit
3015081 i think independence ought to be regarded as an option for the future rather than as an aim
3015082 the other danger is that by putting the emphasis on independence we take our eye off the really important ball which is to achieve things for wales in the here and now we need to be getting things right in the short term rather than becoming too concerned about the wonderful place over there

3015098 my proposal is to make the encouragement of chinese settlements of africa a part of our national policy in the belief that the chinese immigrants would not only maintain their position but that they would multiply and their descendants supplant the inferior negro race i should expect that the african seaboard now sparsely occupied by lazy palavering savages might in a few years be tenanted by industrious order loving chinese living either as a semi detached dependency of china or else in perfect freedom under their own law

3015129 nonchalant attitude of nigerians toward such issue of national importance even when they know the implication
3015130 it has been the habit of some nigerians to be nonchalant about their civic responsibility
3015131 on some occasions they even ask for gratification from the field officers for coming to register by right we are not supposed to pay for what you will benefit from
3015132 it smacks of gross insensitivity for a group which has dominated every aspect of the government of the state since its creation in 1991 to want to deny our people a voice in the senate it just does not make sense it is not fair
3015133 i was at the inec organised constituency delineation meeting last month in the western senatorial district and the issue of altering the senatorial districts did not come up but we heard that a document was being circulated among a select group of people in the state regarding the new senatorial maps we heard the promoters are planning to smuggle it into the inec report because of its explosive nature
3015134 this is a classic case of gerrymandering a situation where constituencies are re drawn to place some people or groups at a disadvantage politically
3015135 but i want to assure you that it will not work some of us will rather die than allow our voices to be silenced at the national assembly we want inec to immediately disassociate itself from this evil plan there is already a heightened ethnic tension in the state as a result of complaints about marginalization why would any reasonable person want to worsen the situation
3015136 if you look at the federal house of representatives and the state house of assembly constituencies being proposed by inec with the support of the state government you will discover that they are lopsided in favour of the east it is not fair for them to use the machinery of government and the state representative at inec to manipulate things in their favour there should be a sense of fairness
3015137 we are waiting for the report of the exercise in the national assembly and we shall see how anyone will approve such nonsense kogi state is for all of us no group can impose itself on others where there is no fairness and equity there will be no peace
3015138 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software

3015171 security agencies are monitoring the situation to see that it does not claim innocent lives it is to protect innocent lives that we had to intervene in abonnema also i remember at ogoloma jetty they attempted to surprise our troops located to guard caw thorn channel marine base territorial waters etc when they came close our gun boats sank two of their speed boats with the occupants it is not always we like to say this or that number has been killed we dont like counting death tolls on the pages of newspapers this is why we dont record our operational successes on the pages of the papers

3015180 nigerians cried foul at the time but the government tried to allay our fears by using some excuses albeit untenable we were told that he was still the chairman of the efcc someone was appointed as acting chairman in his absence not long ago farida waziri was appointed as the substantive chairman of the efcc the appointment is still being challenged in court

3015193 the arts are not a frill they are the heart of the matter a society without the arts would have broken its mirror and cut out its heart it would no longer be what we recognize as human
3015194 creative artistic activity and the goods and services directly produced by it and the preservation of human heritage i
3015195 arts and cultural activities are at the heart of communities they make communities more attractive places to live they help bring a community to life they define a communitys unique characteristics they attract tourists and they help communities compete economically around the world
3015196 people want to live and work in vibrant communities filled with creative people and educational opportunities an active arts and cultural life in a community draws members of the creative class to it thus not only for quality of life reasons but also for hard nosed economic motives it is important to support a vibrant arts and cultural life in communities in order to attract talented people and companies to power the economies of those communities
3015197 just sit down and shut up and dont speak cause theres nothing wrong
3015198 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
3015199 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
3015200 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
3015201 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3015202 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
3015203 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
3015204 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

3015247 there is a new hitler in the middle east he is the president of iran he intends to build nuclear weapons and his brazen declarations to kill the jews have been carried on the front pages of the worlds press in 1935 the christians of the world were silent in the 21st century christians are united in their support of israel we will not be silent in our pulpits on our global media networks in our schools and universities and in the halls of congress we will not keep silent the voice of evil will not go uncontested in our generation not on our watch
3015248 my colleague from new york congressman engel and i agree on very little except when it comes to our complete support for nation of israel my presence here today is certainly no surprise i am a christian evangelical and it was just a matter of scheduling but for congressman engel being here today was an act of moral courage
3015249 i have known and loved pastor john hagee for over 25 years there can be no overstating the depth and sincerity of his devotion to israel
3015250 glass building on 42nd street and first avenue in manhattan had become a terrible place to work
3015251 the days of remaining silent in the face of jew haters is over we say never again to the likes of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad never again to hamas terrorists never again to the united nations never again to universities that espouse hatred for israel and never again to endorsements of presidential candidates
3015252 cufi is alive and well stronger than ever and we are not leaving
3015253 israel will be the praise of all the earth the jewish people have given us the bible the prophets and we cannot explain our existence as christians without the jews but the jews can explain their existence without us christians there would be no christianity today without the jews
3015254 why wont lieberman who is married to the daughter of holocaust survivors end his relationship with hagee why in apparent defiance of the mccain campaign does he remain scheduled to headline hagees upcoming summit if lieberman plans to continue touting his moral fiber and independence as his greatest assets he must renounce the hate mongering hagee
3015255 represents a lot of people in this country particularly christians who care about the state of israel
3015256 as you may know there has been an organized and aggressive campaign to convince me to cancel my speech this evening following the political controversy that broke out over pastor hagee and some of the comments he made but the bond i feel with pastor john hagee and each of you including a significant delegation from connecticut is much stronger than that and so i am proud to stand with you here tonight
3015257 throughout too much of the world it seems that israel is condemned for its every move while excuses are invented for every indecency of its enemies
3015258 you name shall no longer be jacob but israel for you have striven with g d and with men and you have prevailed
3015259 the threat from iran lies not just in their arming training and funding terrorists throughout the middle east and the world but even more from the nuclear weapons development program they are clearly pursuing history warns us what can happen when we dont take the threats of such tyrants and terrorists seriously we must not repeat this mistake
3015260 foreign banks and companies dont want to lose the ability to operate in the us and trade with us and so the sanctions in this bill will help economically isolate the regime in teheran
3015261 people who move the world do not believe that it is inevitable they will sit atop the world they lead not because they believe in their greatness but because they believe in a cause that is greater than themselves they see a mission to accomplish a destiny to shape that is precisely what all of you here do you see israel and america under threat and so you stand up for both you stand for israel not because it is easy or because it is popular but because it is right you stand up for israel because you recognize that it is a cause that is just and honorable because it is a cause greater than yourselves
3015262 i am here tonight to show my support for an organization that courageously extols the jewish right to the land of israel

3015316 kmworlds webinars are always popular but especially so when two such hot topics enterprise search and email are on the agenda
3015317 were delighted to have one of the industrys sharpest observers sue feldman sharing her insights
3015318 i am excited to be discussing how search technologies can solve one of the most pressing problems for information workers today mining their email and integrating it into the rest of their workflow at this x1 technologies sponsored event
3015319 the enterprise search market is undergoing rapid changes these technologies will be crucial in shaping the information access platform that is emerging as an enterprise requirement for doing business
3015320 x1 was a pioneer in search with our desktop solution and as weve expanded into the enterprise with server and application support weve evolved our solutions to scale with the enterprise while not abandoning the ease of use we are known for
3015321 even though enterprise search will be a 2 billion market in 2008 we believe there is still a lack of broad knowledge on the subject which is why we are happy to have susan feldman with idc as the featured presenter for this webinar

3015333 it was an epic ben hur production but it was just so precise military precise and as an australian i like thing to be more spontaneous
3015334 after the build up i was a bit disappointed it lacked heart and soul and was a bit too robotic i think opening ceremonies have become too expensive i think the simple ceremonies of the old days like melbourne in 1956 were much more sincere and much more in keeping with what the games are really about
3015335 the olympics is about participation the money spent on such extravagant ceremonies could be used to support countries that cant afford to send athletes to the games

3015344 ya alloh maha suci engkau yang telah menciptakan makhluk begitu indah maka bagaimana dengan engkau pasti jauh lebih cantik dan lebih indak dari ciptaan mu ini ya alloh lindungilah hati ini dari ketertarikan dan keterpesonaan terhadap kecantikan wanita itu tapi jadikanlah hati ini tertarik dan terpesona dengan kecantikan dan keindahan mu ya alloh janganlah engkau jadikan hati ini terlena oleh kecantikan wanita itu tapi jadikanlah hati ini selalu enang memuji dan mencintai mu

3015348 dijadikan indah pada pandangan manusia kecintaan kepada apa apa yang diingini yaitu wanita wanita anak anak harta yang banyak dari jenis emas perak kuda pilihan binatang binatang ternak dan sawah ladang itulah kesenangan hidup di dunia dan di sisi alloh lah tempat kembali yang baik
3015349 hampir hampir orang orang kafir mengerumuni kalian sebagaimana berkerumunnya di atas sebuah tempayan
3015350 bahkan kalian saat itu banyak akan tetapi kalian bagaikan buih di atas air dan alloh benar benar akan mencabut rasa ketakutan dari hati musuh kalian dan benar benar alloh akan campakkan ke dalam hati kalian penyakit al wahn
3015351 alloh memberitakan dalam dua ayat ini ali imran 13 14 tentang keadaan manusia kaitannya dengan masalah lebih mencintai kehidupan dunia daripada akhirat dan alloh menjelaskan perbedaan yang besar antara dua negeri tersebut alloh swt memberitakan bahwa hal hal tersebut syahwat wanita anak anak dsb dihiaskan kepada manusia sehingga membelalakkan pandangan mereka dan menancapkannya di dalam hati hati mereka semuanya berakhir kepada segala bentuk kelezatan jiwa sebagian besar condong kepada perhiasan dunia tersebut dan menjadikannya sebagai tujuan terbesar dari cita cita cinta dan ilmu mereka padahal semua itu adalah perhiasan yang sedikit dan akan hilang dalam waktu yang sangat cepat
3015352 cinta tidak bisa didefinisikan dengan jelas bahkan bila didefinisikan tidak menghasilkan sesuatu melainkan menambah kabur dan tidak jelas berarti definisinya adalah adanya cinta itu sendiri
3015353 sebagian salaf mengatakan bahwa suatu kaum telah mengaku cinta kepada alloh lalu alloh menurunkan ayat ujian kepada mereka
3015354 katakanlah jika kalian cinta kepada alloh maka ikutilah aku niscaya alloh akan mencintai kalian
3015355 tiga hal yang barangsiapa ketiganya ada pada dirinya niscaya dia akan mendapatkan manisnya iman hendaklah alloh dan rosul nya lebih ia cintai daripada selain keduanya dan hendaklah dia mencintai seseorang dan tidaklah dia mencintainya melainkan karena alloh dan hendaklah dia benci untuk kembali kepada kekufuran setelah alloh selamatkan dia dari kekufuran itu sebagaimana dia benci untuk dilemparkan ke dalam neraka
3015356 tetapi alloh menjadikan kamu cinta kepada keimanan dan menjadikan iman itu indah dalam hatimu
3015357 maka alloh akan mendatangkan suatu kaum yang alloh mencintai mereka dan merekapun mencintai nya
3015358 hendaklah alloh dan rosul nya lebih dia cintai daripada selain keduanya
3015359 dan di antara manusia ada yang menjadikan selain alloh sebagai tandingan tandingan bagi alloh mereka mencintai tandingan tandingan tersebut seperti cinta mereka kepada alloh
3015360 ketika mereka saudara saudara yusuf alaihis salam berkata yusuf dan adiknya lebih dicintai oleh bapak kita daripada kita
3015361 dasar tauhid dan ruhnya adalah keikhlasan dalam mewujudkan cinta kepada alloh cinta merupakan landasan penyembahan dan peribadatan kepada nya bahkan cinta itu merupakan hakikat ibadah tidak akan sempurna tauhid kecuali bila kecintaan seorang hamba kepada rabbnya juga sempurna
3015362 tidaklah mungkin penyakit ini muncul kecuali atas orang yang suka melamun dan menganggur
3015363 perkara yang paling berbahaya bagi seorang hamba adalah kehampaan hati dan jiwa karena sesungguhnya jiwa itu tidak akan pernah kosong jika tidak disibukkan dengan hal hal yang bermanfaat pasti akan terisi dengan hal hal yang membahayakan
3015364 barangsiapa yang jatuh cinta kemudian menahan dirinya menyembunyikannya dan bersabar setelah itu dia meninggal maka dianggap mati syahid
3015365 sesungguhnya apabila hati telah merasakan manisnya ibadah kepada alloh dan ikhlas kepada nya maka tidak ada yang lebih manis lebih indah lebih nikmat dan lebih baik darinya
3015366 manusia tidak dicela karena tabiat yang tercipta dalam dirinya yang dicela adalah jika ia melakukannya

3015384 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up
3015385 when i told abbie hoffman that he was the first one who made me laugh

3015391 my own opinion even speaking as a woman is that no more female input should be allowed in establishing and enforcing the rules and regulations of a men group if this is to be a haven for men to discuss mens issues then women shouldnt be designing the room and painting it pink and putting up lace curtains and a lot of frilly doilies jmo

3015484 the palestinian leadership has been talking to its people and the world for over 30 years about an independent palestinian state on the june 4 1967 borders but israel keeps sabotaging this option
3015485 if israel continues to reject this then the alternative choice of the palestinian people and its leadership is a bi national state
3015486 we have not reached an agreement on any of the final status issues which shows the difficulties we are facing
3015487 it takes two to tango and we are negotiating and we will continue to negotiate its not such a easy thing to solve this problem its been around for 100 years
3015488 but its a positive thing that we sit together and talk
3015489 our policy is well known we believe in the two state solution one state for the palestinians living side by with israel in peace according to the road map and according to the annapolis programme
3015490 the palestinians also believe in that or they wouldnt be sitting with us day in and day out

3015492 i am surprised and indeed extremely annoyed because of this doping case in the olympics having said that the fact that the doping was spanish does not particularly surprise me
3015493 spanish authorities need to realize and deal with it it is a serious problem and needs to be treated as such there needs to be a very strong campaign a huge number of increased tests investigations into the people who are in the background providing the doping products
3015494 there is a law against it the people who are doing it need to be caught and punished so the message comes out
3015495 in many other countries you always get individuals caught in doping

3015520 sie wissen wie hart der wettbewerb ist deshalb m ssen sie uns mit dem preis entgegenkommen
3015521 den besseren service wollte ich nicht warum soll ich ihn dann bezahlen
3015522 aber meines wissens haben unsere leute das umgehend gel st so dass sie
3015523 ich entnehme ihren ausf hrungen dass sie mit unserer zusammenarbeit zufrieden ist
3015524 dann wollen sie sicher auch k nftig mit uns zusammenarbeiten
3015525 deshalb m ssen wir unsere preise um 4 73 prozent erh hen
3015526 das haben wir uns gedacht deshalb haben wir nochmals mit unseren zulieferern verhandelt au erdem haben wir die abl ufe xy optimiert dadurch konnten wir unsere kosten um fast zwei prozent senken weshalb wir unsere preise letztlich nur um 2 87 prozent erh hen m ssen
3015527 unser bauteil hat bei ihren st ckkosten nur einen anteil von vier prozent wenn wir unsere preise um 2 87 prozent erh hen steigen ihre st ckkosten nur um circa 0 15 prozent also 87 cent wollen sie daf r das risiko eingehen dass

3015531 it is past time for the iraqis to take more responsibility for their own reconstruction with the iraqis sitting on a massive budget surplus we need to return american tax dollars to the u s treasury
3015532 the iraqis have the money to pay for reconstruction efforts and with the price of oil where it is today the united states should not be an atm for the iraqi government for the people of iraq this is a matter of self determination and self reliance for american taxpayers its a matter of fairness
3015533 the iraqis have made great progress in developing their oil infrastructure and they are now in a position to assume greater financial responsibility of their economic future now is the time to capitalize on this positive progress by ensuring that iraqis foot the bill for the reconstruction of their own sovereign country
3015534 the gao report on iraqi oil revenues simply underscores what i have said for some time the iraqi government must begin to use its oil revenues to rebuild and reconstruct their infrastructure

3015585 it is normal to be more optimistic about ones own quality of life than about the economy as a whole
3015586 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3015587 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3015588 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3015590 i dont think that the government can afford to leave people in that level of doubt for so long
3015591 obviously the exercise is a complex one but it neednt be as complex as would be suggested by the extent of delay that the governments now foreshadowing
3015592 theres no value in continuing to just bandaid a system when the commitment must be to making a very strong one
3015593 the cost of foods gone up the cost of petrol and electricity and all the other issues as well
3015594 it reinforces the strength of the people that came to our committee and explained exactly what their weekly and fortnightly and annual budgets were for them
3015595 this is saying we heard that and we want to make sure that we as a country work with them to come up with a better solution
3015596 rural people really are often in a worse state as well in their pensions because a lot of rural areas their food and petrol if theyre able to drive and theres no public transport
3015597 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3015598 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3015599 in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock
3015600 an observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it making it seem to disappear
3015601 understood that georgia had signed a ceasefire agreement and called on russia to accept an immediate ceasefire
3015602 in recent months ive come to believe that most people finally understand that macs and pcs are comparably priced when comparably equipped
3015603 that is until i read some more of that silly fiction that attempts to convey precisely the reverse that apple is the bmw and the pc is the ford and that the former is priced accordingly when compared to the latter
3015604 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3015605 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3015606 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3015607 20 years after i first testified before congress on the threats posed by climate change we have reached a point at which we must remove unnecessary carbon emissions from our lives or face catastrophic consequences it is hard to imagine waste more unnecessary than the 100 billion pieces of junk mail americans receive each year and these new findings revealing that the emissions of junk mail are equal to those of over nine million cars underscore the prudent necessity of a do not mail registry
3015608 sometimes people are just using you to vent because they have gone through so much
3015609 and when they get to work or school they have an attitude but you never know what is going on with them at home when you show love to that person he or she might break down in your arms and you can begin the healing process

3015757 as i started seeing all the media on barack obama i started realising that john mccain didnt have that rally song or fight song something that tin get everybody together to fight so i took it upon myself to try to write the theme song for his campaign
3015758 john mccain has been a prisoner of war and a true american hero hes been through strain and injuries and has the scars to essay it so i thought ive got to write a song that reflects that and shows how this guy is a steel rod of a patriot how hes firm and has always put his state before himself
3015759 the maverick spirit of the song sells particularly well to all americans even obama supporters
3015760 if i can create them realize about where john mccain has total from and the journey hes been on theres no way they cannot respect him for that
3015761 the more than you get to experience john mccain the more you regard the fact that hes both a patriot and an independent thinker a rebel when it means staying truthful to what he believes in hopefully my song will help those people out in that location who are starting to pay attention to him to realize what genial of guy cable he is

3015774 but let me be straight forward on this jesus was god and there was never a time when he and lucifer were on the same plane
3015775 man was also in the beginning with god intelligence or the light of truth was not created or made neither indeed can be
3015776 the mind or the intelligence which man possesses is co equal with god himself
3015777 our spirit matter was eternal and co existent with god but it was organized into spirit bodies by our heavenly father
3015778 every spirit that comes to this earth to take upon it a tabernacle is a son or a daughter of god and possesses all the intelligence and all the attributes that any son or daughter can enjoy either in the spirit world or in this world except that in the spirit and separated from the body they lacked just the tabernacle of being like god the father
3015779 there are varying degrees of intelligence among heavenly fathers children
3015780 w e know they were all innocent in the beginning but the right of free agency which was given to them enabled some to outstrip others and thus through the eons of immortal existence to become more intelligent more faithful for they were free to act for themselves to think for themselves to receive the truth or rebel against it
3015781 the ascendancy of jesus christ among all of our spirit brothers and sisters is clearly set forth
3015782 during his pre mortal life jesus christ rose to the status of godhood
3015783 there was never a time when jesus and lucifer were on the same plane
3015784 how can jesus and lucifer be spirit brothers when their characters and purposes are so utterly opposed
3015785 how could two such great spirits become so totally opposite the answer lies in the principle of agency which has existed from all eternity see d amp c 93 30 31 of lucifer the scripture says that because of rebellion he became satan yea even the devil the father of all lies moses 4 4 note that he was not created evil but became satan by his own choice

3015805 mas assembly bill 2716 was one of hundreds of bills acted upon by the senate and assembly appropriations committees thursday three weeks before the scheduled end of the legislative session
3015806 ab 2716 was fiercely opposed by business interests but its demise apparently was due to its projected costs of implementation and enforcement in a year when the state faces a 15 2 billion deficit
3015807 the bill would have entitled full and part time workers to a limited number of paid sick days each year for illnesses involving themselves or their spouse parent child or domestic partner
3015808 laird 58 has parlayed his sense of humor along with a rare intelligence and a genuine gregariousness into surprising influence especially over the budget process
3015809 laird is in an unusual limbo this summer he cant predict when the state budget will be completed because of partisan bickering and he doesnt know what his future holds after december

3015851 that means 10 000 spent on a kitchen remodel in a mobile home next to the railroad tracks in a poorly rated school district will not reap the same return as 10 000 spent on a 6 bedroom hillside home with a view in a highly rated school district

3015901 one of the more interesting potentialities for future postcolonial rhetorical studies will involve alternative ways of thinking about the relationship between orthodox texts spatial mappings and temporal representations
3015902 turning an attentive historiographic quest into a version of contests for the worst victim
3015903 critical interventions through the insertion of vernacular words or through a regrammatization of the standard language
3015904 in terms of the saussurian categories of parole and langue
3015905 by carelessly insinuating the priority of a european langue over and above the possibility of non european parole these critics once again repeat the tired colonist assumption that it takes the west in the shape of either theory or history to bring the rest to the condition of intelligibility

3015912 act is executed in the presence of the rhetors intended audience
3015913 those who are most attentive to campaign information sic are the least open to persuasion by it
3015914 the six representatives firmly condemned the coup and said it was unacceptable to overthrow a democratically elected president and demanded that the president and his prime minister are set free and constitutional order is restored
3015915 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
3015916 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
3015917 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
3015918 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
3015919 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
3015920 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
3015921 i really do like the fact that no other european has won those two majors consecutively
3015922 because i obviously hold a lot of european players that i grew up watching in high esteem to believe that i achieved something that they hadnt is very special
3015923 i know i love the idea of the back nine of a major of sunday
3015924 i love it so much im actually disappointed im eight months away from the next major
3015925 theres guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back
3015926 the fans deserted me then those guys were having such a good battle
3015927 its a long way to catch tiger at the top
3015928 human culture as we have known it for the past 200 years is drawing to a close a revolution of civilization is upon us prepare

3015930 nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could only do a little
3015931 russias military strikes in georgia toll a knell for many of europes hopes such the possibility of sharing common fundamental values with russia
3015932 the entire spectrum of relations between the european union and russia should be re examined
3015933 assume a key role in ending the attacks by russias armed forces on civil and military targets in georgia
3015934 it is the european union that can and should be the strong power that induces the russian federation to end its military activity on the territory of the republic of georgia
3015935 war has broken out in europe a european nation has fallen victim to the aggression of its neighbour and the european union as the bearer of european values cannot remain a helpless bystander
3015936 president saakashvili french foreign minister bernard kouchner and finnish foreign minister alexander stubb signed a document which is a summary of a peace proposal this document will be presented to the russian leader
3015937 should enable the return to france of french and european nationals who were passing through georgia and who are currently blocked in tbilisi because of the interruption of commercial flights
3015938 it would be negative for europe if a sort of coalition against russia develops which could happen
3015939 we are close to russian prime minister vladimir putin on that
3015940 asking for the emergency summit means moving towards a condemnation of russia a position that would be negative for all of europe
3015941 its important that the europe of 27 not divide itself into factions and small groups it should be a bridge between the united states and russia if it wants to have a political role with any weight
3015942 currently entrusted exclusively to its military forces should be the subject of discussions with the international community
3015943 if french foreign minister bernard kouchner after his meetings in tbilisi and moscow makes a proposal in this direction on wednesday at the meeting of foreign ministers and if it is accepted we will consider it
3015944 there are a lot of ifs and we would have to redeploy our forces which are not unlimited

3015953 it is perhaps still too early to conclude that ppi growth has peaked
3015954 the sharp acceleration in producer price inflation seen in recent months is a concern to policymakers as this poses a strong upside risk to cpi consumer price index growth
3015955 in the next few months the authorities will likely further tighten monetary policy and impose price curbs to deal with this inflation risk
3015956 russia had to move in if only to save face
3015957 should russia confine its efforts to south ossetia it still might emerge out of this mess as the power who moved in to stop bloodshed
3015958 should russia move further into georgia it will be deemed the aggressor

3015971 thats two weeks in a row when you get that belief and that excitement its good to see
3015972 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
3015973 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3015974 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3015975 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
3015976 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
3015977 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
3015978 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3015979 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family

3016026 smiles and walks away eddy eagerly opens the envelope stops to take a look around to see if anyone is watching he pulls out a laminated card baring a level 6 access
3016027 i have been going over the old files i ran into a problem according to the graph it seems that the object is bouncing around like a pinball being sling shot by other planets gravity to change its direction i converted the old files and made a new simulation and well it seems that the old records are wrong think you could take a look at what i have so far its only about 30 min long
3016028 sure eddy go ahead get it started in the dark room and ill take a look
3016029 mr scott came to me with something you have been working on and i was hoping we could get together and see what else you can come up with
3016030 excusing himself to areon then passing a wink to eddy as he turns to walk away
3016031 good youre both here sgt acuff will see you now
3016032 well seems like the two of you have ruffled some feathers
3016033 its ok i was one of the first missioners of eagle eye the object that you have been researching has been a skeleton in the closet for a long time and we need to know what more you have found ive read over your report and i get the impression that you left out alot am i wrong

3016038 the butler responded with a very well sir and went back indoors placing fresh towels on the bar as he went

3016040 there is bathing suits in the bungalow for the misses
3016041 and with that the butler raised a fluffy eyebrow to eddy as he headed back to the door
3016042 the foreign voice either chinese japanese or some asian dialects continued as the interpreter continued speaking over the voice
3016043 i sincerely apologize for my absence and trust that you have been taken well care of
3016044 the interpreter translated he and giato both laughed and entered
3016045 how long have you been working on the program mr
3016046 sorry areon there is something i didnt tell you i altered one part of the path i was hoping i was wrong but the more we know the closer it is
3016047 so why did you hide your true findings even from your co worker
3016048 i understand but that wasnt why i was sent to you there is something i didnt tell you i have been working on the same project but my field was mapping the systems that it had already passed through
3016049 if we had a mapping of the systems that it will pass through we could have a better idea were it will go will it hit in another galaxy or continue to slide right on through to us
3016050 yes but that still doesnt figure as to how much momentum it will gain or loose
3016051 so you need a mapping we can take care of that
3016052 its not the end it might just be passing through just like the rest of the cosmos on its way someplace else
3016053 as she smashed a plate cup and silverware onto the table
3016054 with a laugh he walks up to areon and hugs her from behind whispers to her
3016055 but its not fair to be able to tell the future but not change it
3016056 eddy starts to speak but his words come short as areon closes the gap between with a kiss
3016057 its done or at least as done as we have time for
3016058 smart thinking i knew their was a good reason for keeping you around
3016059 as he pulls areon into his lap and plays back their hard work in high speed
3016060 areon spoke up firmly as though she had done this before
3016061 wen you finish speaking say stop clearly after you are spoken to wait a moment before speaking
3016062 press the button before you address if you address the whole group say
3016063 this will tell you who is addressing you in the same manner
3016064 speak clearly and try not to run your words together or to fast
3016065 well will this take long if so just be ready with seats just in case
3016066 i wonder why they are so eager to separate us
3016067 what you dont do you honestly see this as a mere coincidence com on aeron think about it we both came from the same place and now we are getting tossed to the winds it doesnt sound like a good thing more like we are being punished
3016068 areon get some place safe the basement quick you dont have much time go now before

3016071 eddy holds his breath never taking his eyes off the clock
3016072 so he ate his fill and then some he then individually wrapped as much as he could to help keep it from going bad
3016073 eddy grabbed up his clothing started getting dressed wen a young child cried out

3016080 i tell you what tim i will stop with the small talk you can keep calling me me
3016081 with that tim shot out from his dads lap into megs open arms nearly knocking her over
3016082 this came in very handy and i thought of you every time tim shrugged his shoulders and went on his way eddy well looks like tims not interested in the rest of it
3016083 as she pulled out 4 coffee cups from a box by the wall that was trying to evolve into a kitchen harold
3016084 well looks like we all have to grow up some time
3016085 the two staggered away harold led the way to a large room with just one patch of light in the middle of the room shining down on a dingy cloth
3016086 i dont know what the hell that kid was thinking i never sat my fat ass on a bike my hole life and i sure as hell dont plan on jumping on it and killing myself
3016087 momma says if you lost it you didnt need it to start with im not sure what it meant but what the hell cheers
3016088 he started taking off his clothes and meg turned around with her hand still on her hip and the other palm up at her shoulder eddy striped folded his clothes and handed them to meg
3016089 by the way their is some fresh gear on the stool
3016090 im dying please try to give my baby a chance please
3016091 how am i going to feed this child soon it will wake and hungry it will be
3016092 the ribs will make a nice basket for the child the leg bones will come in handy as well
3016093 you need a name little one and a fitting one it shall be
3016094 eddy began experimenting with the ash he found that the ash that got less sun was almost sweet and moist so he began collecting it and using the skull of the beast to extract the liquid from the living ash that was more becoming of a black moss soon he had enough to fill his water bottle and just in time for feeding he made up some in the powdered milk and tried it for him self
3016095 well little one since we are going to be living off this for a while i think we should name it
3016096 he checks to see if she is in need of cleaning then tries to feed her
3016097 they out number us kiddo so i dont think it will be wise to bother them on their own turf what do you think
3016098 eddy holds out his arms looks to the sky and raises his voice
3016099 hestia laughs with a squeal and buries her head in eddys chest
3016100 he wipes off his hands and continues to clean the area and checking the openings for loose spots
3016101 sleep well my little goddess dream little dreams and have no fear phoenix is here so sleep now and in morning we will be near
3016102 i still have a few hours before the shade is gone
3016103 yes a few we have been watching you and the child you are the first we have seen since it happened
3016104 its only me manny times i have watched you from here many times i have watched you and the little one play many times my heart wept
3016105 to know such a name do you know what it means
3016106 then ran off to collect more brigid for the fire
3016107 this is called a fish it lives in the water
3016108 child over here quickly into the water hestia you must hurry
3016109 just think of the birth of the world itself and of all life in it the very chemistry of life in everything humans animals plants even the smallest organisms breathing growing killing surviving reproducing and even dying those lives that sometimes threatens our own has driven man to learn more about life its self this is not something you should shield her from instead you should encourage her to embrace it
3016110 as he looked around he noticed that the creatures wear looking at him hestia noticed and began looking around at the heads of her new friends bobbing up and down with the waves
3016111 that wasnt the first one you have seen is it
3016112 what is it is it safe how do we get there
3016113 as she ran over to the fence then stopping as she gets close enough to get a good look at the two standing motionless and silent
3016114 as she knelt in front of hestia with her fingers griping the metal wire that separated
3016115 as a truck full of men pulled up and the passengers jumped clear of it taking one look at eddy then pointing their guns toward him a sound arose from beneath eddys coat as hestia grasped his leg
3016116 you just stand right their and dont move a muscle
3016117 what a pretty name and what is your fathers name
3016118 and this is doug our finest mr fix it doug if you will lets see what can be done to get these two scarecrows out of the coop
3016119 sheriff think the interrogations can wait at least until hes on this side of the fence
3016120 i swear momma must have dropped you on your head
3016121 doc tries to cut in till jodie pushes him against the fence then sticks her fist up to the sheriff
3016122 boy you pull that thing on me you dam well better shoot me dead
3016123 sheriff jumps into his car and races off just as doug is coming back
3016124 man i tell you one of these days doc wont be around and she going to kill that lil prick
3016125 as he stopped about 20 feet from the bickering crowd and pointed out toward a large tree with a swing hanging from its lowest limb
3016126 the tree is on some ones property doug is going over now to talk to her i dont see it as a problem she is a good lady
3016127 she said with a smile behind her cup eddy grabs his blade as a sound from behind him with its fast clumsy pace drew near it was doug as he collapsed on the opposite side of the small fire from jodie gasping for air
3016128 just throw that against the house out of the way and give me a hand
3016129 she opens the lock then the door and soon the light after a missed attempt of the switch she removes the items from top of a much smaller but sturdy and very nice work bench then wipes it off and slaps the middle
3016130 she then began dragging the table out the door pushing eddy on out she stumbled eddy caught her fall
3016131 watch the ground so you dont kick it and wen you want to stop do the same thing opposite ok
3016132 good night the door is open should you need the necessitys and food please your my guests theirs not much room but your welcome to the floor if needed
3016133 the moment you agreed to let them stay here this is as of now state property
3016134 now eddy if you dont let them have your weapons they will kill you most of these guys have been drinking all night and i for one dont want this to go badly in front of hestia
3016135 the next one that tries to go near her will be the last one to die
3016136 shoot that bastard he tried to kill me you are all witnesses
3016137 lets get one thing very clear you will not push me aside you will not come on to my property pushing someone else around and you sure as hell will be spending the next few weeks in the dark you fat lazy bastard now get up and get the hell off my land now
3016138 and just what the hell are you smiling at are you so stupid that you cant tell wen you have outstayed your welcome
3016139 he shakes his head with a wide smile sticking out his hand to eddy saying
3016140 then telling doc how he had found the girl making sure to be vague on certain details
3016141 yea i think i can take care of it for you thanks
3016142 he chuckled as the nurse drew blood from eddys arm
3016143 but um i just wanted to see if you wasnt busy tonight well maby we could
3016144 i have something even more interesting just for you she turns hestia around then dried her hair noticing that the once almost black child was blond with a milky fine complexion surrounding the whitest eyes set with brilliant green surrounding the largest darkest pupil she had ever seen
3016145 no one here will get close to me long enough to do anything more than request me to fix build or destroy something
3016146 i knew for some reason i knew there was life out there
3016147 its safe you have been close enough to it that you should be able to last better than 3 hours
3016148 what if you only put one on and someone comes out before we return and they added a different lock
3016149 no its not but it will be in a few days after a few weeks its like your alcohol and after a few months
3016150 i was on the roof of old man dickersons the cheep old fart a gust of wind nearly knocked me off
3016151 honestly i thought i was dead then wen i came out i looked out over the ruins there was not a fire one i ran out to see if there was any survivors but the ash in the air was so thick i couldnt see my hand in front
3016152 he help eddy onto the chair then tends to the stove putting on fresh water
3016153 he pulls out a gun and points it at doug
3016154 then looking at doug with a wink and a smile
3016155 doug opens the locks his hands shaking as he pulls the gate open eddy steps out still holding dick tight with his face soaked in tears and his pants just as wet doug closes the door then replaces the first lock then the second before locking it he asks
3016156 me and the mutt man are going to spend some quality time together
3016157 as he returns to the truck opening up a box then bringing eddy several items and pushing them through the bars
3016158 eddy thanks dough and tells him that they will be back in a few days doug reminds eddy that the workers could only last a few hours as eddy pulls the mutt man farther into his domain
3016159 you scream out and i promise you this will be your tomb
3016160 ok you have two simple choices you can climb your fat ass back up that rope or we can try these doors and maby find a easier way out but i will not carry you i will leave you behind
3016161 great another empty room got any more of those pattys left
3016162 and other invalid id then a echo from the past as eddy looked to the side of the monitor
3016163 stay close dont wonder off i am going to have a look around
3016164 and dont push any more buttons especially flashing red ones
3016165 as he sat down wiping the sweat from his face
3016166 i draw the line at brain food ill stick to a big mack thank you very much
3016167 well soon as your done come on in wash up your just in time for lunch
3016168 as she pours him a coffee and places it on the table returning to the stove
3016169 hestia turns looking over the back of the chair it hiding her smile but her eyes giving it away
3016170 good evening guys sheriff how may i assist you boys
3016171 you can start by putting your hands were i can see them
3016172 well sheriff my hand do seem to be in clear view
3016173 now lie down on the ground face down with your feet crossed
3016174 as he tightens his grip causing the sheriff to cry out
3016175 i got two shots and their is 6 of you who wants to be first sit
3016176 by the way ms alexa you are in violation be sure you get these vehicles off the premises as soon as passable
3016177 you want to sell one of those trucks by chance
3016178 lets talk it over a cup of akta shall we
3016179 well i got a lot of work to be done think you can get away for the night
3016180 just think of the birth of the world itself and of all life in it the very chemistry of life in everything humans animals plants even the smallest organism
3016181 so come all ye and find your right place under my feet
3016182 if you wanted me dead then dead i would be so what is it you want
3016183 dose that put your mind at ease like you said
3016184 come rest a while i will send food and provisions for you
3016185 as he began to turn leo placed his hand on eddys shoulder a silent click from beneath eddy coat
3016186 i know you have meet with them and since i have not heard of you id have to say you met the greenys to the north
3016187 yes as we two have discovered but none the less i prefer to be referred to as the southern majestic that will rise again and to keep true to my own up bringing
3016188 your roll is the most dangerous you are to run past the beasts as they charged the men go to the home and get the man out and tell the woman to silence her screams and the children
3016189 eddy commands leo as he takes flight through the men then through the bagats that made no attempt at him till it was to late
3016190 as the bagats attention drew to leo the beasts forget about the single man and return there focus to the oncoming men
3016191 then reaches out cutting off a rather large slice for her self chewing it well then wiping the escaped juices from her lips then continuing with her work smashing the strips of meats with the elongated egg shaped stone and its pores texture
3016192 leo had made first contact with the outsiders he started trades with them gold and jewels mostly but money as well
3016193 we thought this was every were most of us were in the airport the bus station or at home like me my house was in a cliff side most of it under ground my family was lucky they didnt live to see this
3016194 as she held up the stone using it to point around at the word
3016195 she stopped eddy took another portion of the brains then offered her some she turned it down with a silent shake as she lost her self in the stone and meats they finished up shortly after sending the boys girls and men off
3016196 eddy pulled out and separated his pallet spreading out one for her as she lays down she was swarmed by a heard of pups eager to play
3016197 i have it was maby a month after i woke up late one night and i saw him he was standing on top of a building across the way he looked right at me then just flew away no one believed me of course but its a man or at least what is left of a man it was dark so i didnt get a good look at his face but he had a bony face like maby a bird but not and wings like a bat but not he flew right over me and i havent seen him since you left the inerts and meats out for him didnt you he must like you wen did you first find him
3016198 eddy went on telling her of the quiqrin farm that he made the drink from then giving her some of the dried tail and telling her of its potential in small doses and how the largest bagat he called barghest was tracking and fallowing him
3016199 leo goes back talks to them they begin to pack up leo walked past eddy his men waited for eddy to fallow before they would leo had an idea that if eddy showed them how to find and harvest the moss they could get better foods and clothing as well as the search was use less no moss could be found to make the akta and he was nearly out now that he had traded off his fullest bladder and this worried him eddy snuck out the next night and headed west until he found good moss and made camp till he had enough akta to fill his jugs and the ones he made on the beach eddys last night their he was awakened abruptly by a woman she was out of breath cold hungry and scared it was elisabeth
3016200 every thing has a purpose and a need it doesnt know why it doesnt chose it
3016201 she took liberty in teaching eddy their ways and language eddy was welcomed into the tribe as well as the beasts he kept company with eddy joined them in their trips to the sea were they had harvested many creatures using a ship
3016202 i think what you meant to say that you are a commander of dogs set loose on a defenseless nation of people that have no need in being told how to live
3016203 i can crush your scull before they can shoot me dead
3016204 you sure have a bad way of showing it now if you dont let him go i will blow you away and their will be no witnesses i p
3016205 your a dead man soon this town will be over run with military and you cant hide in here forever
3016206 you have no idea what you have started do you you see this man he wont hide and he can out last you so unless you want to be on the menu
3016207 i kill you now then go out their and see how many of your men i can kill before they kill me or we can stop this power struggle and you can tell me what you want
3016208 your running out of time your men are getting ready to teargas the house so decide
3016209 he patted garrett on the shoulder twice with a loud smack
3016210 hell the department of ministrant didnt listen but mostly because they new their wasnt a dam thing they could do but go home to their familys and hope for the best and now that its all over and done you want me to care weather or not some asshole that owns allot of land thinks
3016211 let me make it very clear if the one that owns the most land is the one in control then guess what
3016212 to go for a ride you know its been a long time since i rode in a car and i bet you got a great one lets go
3016213 i think we need something a bit larger dont you
3016214 were are we going she has nothing to do with this
3016215 she is just a friend she doesnt know any thing about this
3016216 as she lifted his hand returning it to the steering wheel then turning farther in her seat to eddy
3016217 eddy stared out of the window lost in his own thoughts
3016218 it would be an improvement a real man for once
3016219 excuse me for the interruption but we have a visitor
3016220 as she held her hand out to a leather couch
3016221 she was an older woman that took pride in her look of a younger youth with high heels and stalkings with a seam ruining up the back of her legs to a skirt just above her knees matched with a well fitting jacket and perfect nails on her well adorned fingers her hair was short and full giving a well view of her ears and the jewels that hung from them accenting the rather large necklace that hung close around her long heck
3016222 then having a seat across from him crossing her legs and running her hand up her leg to her skirt giving it a pull then introducing herself
3016223 eddy sat in silence sipping his drink cupped in his hands
3016224 their is something i would like to show you eddy i think you will like it very much
3016225 yes i know who you are and dont worry your secret is safe with me
3016226 i didnt get to were i am by being naive i do know how to use a computer and yes we have many files that were not erased from the storm but relax that is the only proof of who you are keep it its yours a gift do with it as you see fit i have erased everything you my large friend no longer exist in the computer age of man
3016227 thank you old friend may you live long feared by many and loved by all
3016228 as he headed to the roof with his saxton soon joined by doc and elisabeth
3016229 phoenix i think i see what you are getting at but why go through so much trouble to disguise it
3016230 you guys mind filling the dumb blond in on the joke
3016231 i am left handed so i am going to use my right hand slowly eddy removed all of his weapons then pulled out some meats and akta
3016232 as he held out a piece of meat in one hand then bit the other eddy pored two drinks set one on the ground then backed away the man watched eddy as he drank then he cautiously smelled of the dark liquid then drank it down then took a bite of the meats
3016233 then tossed the man his things and showed him his
3016234 he fell i tried to catch him but he was frightened and let go
3016235 and behold he opened the sixth seal and the stars and heavens fell
3016236 i will ask of you once more were is she
3016237 well now that we have been properly introduced now what do you say
3016238 if you want to fallow i will lead you to safe land the people scattered back into the cave one saying give us a moment to gather some things
3016239 we are never alone no matter how lonely we are we are never alone
3016240 we knew that it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams especially china playing in front of their home crowd but we withstood the storm and calmed down and then we just played a lot better basketball
3016241 it was just a thrill to have the leader of our country there
3016242 it was pretty patriotic for us and for the citizens all across the world who are united states citizens
3016243 i thought that the attention we gave yao early was key
3016244 he made really good plays to get his teammates involved and they hit threes and more than half their points in the first half were from threes and we were like one for 12 i think we ended up one for 15 before we started hitting some threes
3016245 i was not too comfortable after the first 200 metres after seeing everybody so close together
3016246 it is usually not how it is after the first 200 that is usually the first 300 mark so i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point coming home on freestyle it is all adrenaline
3016247 it is amazing being here because in the united states you never have crowds like this or anything
3016248 and they go crazy so it is pretty amazing being here my coach is chinese right now all of my coaches that i have had throughout my diving career have all been chinese so this is where they are from this is where they do it so it is fun to be here
3016249 and it was easy only on the last touch of his sword my strategy was to do my fencing and not his fencing
3016250 we did it it was perfect its a dream come true
3016251 i want to thank all the people who have been there from the start i have worked so hard i am so happy

3016257 there will be signs in the sun moon and stars on the earth nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea men will faint from terror apprehensive of what is coming on the world for the heavenly bodies will be shaken at that time they will see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory when these things begin to take place stand up and lift up your heads because your redemption is drawing near
3016258 look at the fig tree and all the trees when they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near even so when you see these things happening you know that the kingdom of god is near
3016259 i tell you the truth this generation b will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened
3016260 be careful or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation drunkenness and the anxieties of life and that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap for it will come upon all those who live on the face of the whole earth be always on the watch and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen and that you may be able to stand before the son of man
3016261 20 year old kid trapped in a 47 year old mans body
3016262 from the beginning of third day we realized that we needed to have someone to speak into our lives as individuals and as a band through the years we have had many people pastors and friends travel with us but of all those people nigel james has been the most important he has allowed us and reminded us to be men of god first and as a result our music and ministry have reflected that nigel has kept us accountable to each other to the church and of course to our lord he has helped us to grow in our faith and has reminded us to stay focused on our calling and on what third day is really all about
3016263 how did you get the job of third days road pastor
3016264 for just as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts
3016265 at another paramount theme park third day talked me into going on the top gun ride with them a frightening experience
3016266 wow these third day guys must be incredible even their guitar tech is a mighty man of god
3016267 leading a bible study with third day today supposedly didnt think newsboys bus would arrive at the venue in time got here with twenty minutes to spare washed and ate only to find all the guys in third day still asleep
3016268 for the kingdom of god is not a matter of talk but of power
3016269 but we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from god and not from us
3016270 since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be destroyed let us be thankful and please god by worshiping him with holy fear and awe for our god is a consuming fire

3016300 det e jo for dokker me har kjypt den helsikkens hytt kom dokker inn i bilen
3016301 at least seven stab wounds were found on his body
3016302 how could he work the help desk which involves lots of small details if he didnt take the time to carefully provide us with the right phone number for his interview
3016303 a leader is powerful to the degree he empowers others
3016304 we have never been and will never be passive observers in the region
3016305 estamos convencidos que es importante unir a los bolivianos a los diferentes sectores del campo y la ciudad del oriente y del occidente
3016306 its very likely to lead to a shortage of chemotherapy places for private patients in canberra and the public system is very much stretched to the limit
3016307 i can foresee that a crisis may well take place in the next three to six months as far as access to chemotherapy is concerned
3016308 i guess what will happen is that the private system will just be as packed as the public system and it will turn out to be another dutch auction just to place patients in spots
3016309 the rebates that were receiving from private health funds are not matching the expenses of running and staffing the unit
3016310 and i suppose bearing in mind that the hospital was sold less than two years ago for being under financial pressure weve got to make some commercial decisions
3016311 as the key referring physician i have recently presented them evidence that other private hospitals are obtaining substantially better health fund rebates for the same services which if attainable would return the unit back to the companys criteria for solvency
3016312 although this information was acknowledged by the hospital they have nonetheless been unwilling to negotiate accordingly with the funds additionally i had informed the hospital well in advance that another oncologist was making plans to commence practice at john james next year
3016313 it just seems to have come very much as a shock a very sudden decision leaving people three months to make other arrangements
3016314 but thats very difficult because i dont know for example when i might need to start chemotherapy again
3016315 i think that cancer patients are very vulnerable and we really value continuing care from people we trust
3016316 its a loss not just to canberra but also to the region
3016317 the patients who are directly affected by this closure some with advanced malignancy will need to endure further hardship to re familiarise themselves with another treatment facility
3016318 the lack of compassion shown by the little company of mary in this instance stands in stark contrast to the highly dedicated cancer care staff across the region who will now have to stretch themselves even further to accommodate the resulting increase in workload using existing resources
3016319 given malcolms lack of success in predicting election outcomes im encouraged by his remark
3016320 our survey work and some major party polling suggest ill be elected
3016321 i just sense that the labor party is going to go very badly when so many people i know who are so clearly left of centre say they dislike him and are not going to vote labor
3016322 its a peculiar situation in that its the only government in australia that also runs local government matters and yet somehow some people in the act labor party also take the view that the act government should be a social laboratory for the country when theres actually a lot of people who just want them to run the services of state and local governments
3016323 the voters will deliver a resounding whack to malcolms prediction
3016324 majority government is not something that easily occurs in the act its not the natural state of things
3016325 i think there is a bit of a national mood that people feel they have been let down by state or territory labor governments theres a feeling certainly here in the act that this is a government that has stopped listening to them and i think there might have been a similar feeling in the northern territory
3016326 take a single vote or a single electorate for granted
3016327 this is particularly the case in the act with its multi leg 1member electorates where a comparatively small number of votes can cause significant shifts
3016328 labor does not underestimate the task in front of it on octoberth18 nothing is certain in life death or politics as proof great britain today won a gold medal for swimming
3016329 it also demonstrates the greens are a credible alternative to the two old leg 2parties as voters increasingly embrace the policies and energy of the greens
3016330 the feeling in the northern territory was the labor party was going to steamroll home and they got that wrong were hopeful and weve still got people coming out as candidates
3016331 it is beholden on us as the nations capital to set the example
3016332 we here in canberra have a lot of policies our national environmental policies so therefore if we are driving agendas for change including greenhouse policies lets do it locally lets walk the talk
3016333 my personal view is there is quite a desperate need for both governments to get together and work out an integrated strategy
3016334 tenemos que ganar al spartak los jugadores saben que tienen que darlo todo para ganar
3016335 our friends helped us see that if we wanted not only to avoid our addictions but actually lose the desire to return to them we had to experience a change of heart
3016336 through the testimonies of others the lord will help you learn the truth that you are not beyond his power to heal
3016337 a new heart will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh
3016338 as you yield to the promptings of the spirit and look to the savior for salvation not only from addiction but from character weaknesses you can be assured that a new disposition or character will grow out of your willing heart
3016339 may we be convinced that jesus is the christ choose to follow him be changed for him captained by him consumed in him and born again
3016340 through the testimonies of others the lord will help you learn the truth that you are not beyond his power to heal
3016341 but behold if ye will awake and arouse your faculties even to an experiment upon my words and exercise a particle of faith yea even if ye can no more than desire to believe let this desire work in you even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words

3016348 after we competed the coaches were going to figure out who was on the team
3016349 we went to dinner everybody finished their dinner and we came back
3016350 martha karolyi the national team coordinator had tears in her eyes and she said she always gets emotional because she knows how long and hard everybody has worked then she announced shawn johnson and nastia liukin because they had already made the team then she said alicia sacramone and then i was fourth
3016351 its a dream that ive dreamt of since i was little
3016352 but i didnt just wake up to it i had to work to get here it shows that hard work pays off
3016353 when they said they could maybe name more we got our hopes up chellsie memmel alicia and i were talking after the meet and when they didnt name us we were disappointed but we all understood the process it made it better at the ranch
3016354 my performance at the trials was pretty good and consistent i was pretty prepared for the camp considering we just came off trials at the same time i knew i had to prove myself i had to prove myself one more time i couldnt ease up i couldnt do anything less

3016376 it is very difficult to get used to tis car it has oversteer in fast corners and understeer in the slower corners sometimes i am not going fast enough while an other time i try too hard sebastian vettel is simply adjusting better to the car than i do
3016377 i have found small things in the car for me to understand the handling of the car better but im still not completely comfortable with the car things are getting better though fortunately
3016378 the take home message here is its a big deal
3016379 its probably the biggest impact in the shortest time that i can think of
3016380 if i can use some of that heat energy and convert it to electricity you can improve the overall efficiency

3016386 you know whats fun go to a german restaurant and insist on using chopsticks
3016387 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3016388 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3016389 i was very firm with vladimir putin just like i was firm with the russian president dmitry medvedev
3016390 moreover when it comes from a representative of a country whose actions with regard to the civil population are well known in iraq in afghanistan even in serbia
3016391 adjusting and constantly evolving expanding and trying to stay as young as i can
3016392 could use a little more substance like we had in the day
3016393 theyre standing on our shoulders some of them dont realize it because they sample me so much
3016394 i started to walk out i thought it was a disney thing i had never heard of this thing
3016395 toward the opening i started having trepidations oh my god what have i done ive ruined my career but when it aired the ratings went through the roof
3016396 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3016397 interesting to me that here we are trying to promote peace and harmony and were witnessing a conflict take place
3016398 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
3016399 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
3016400 there is no possibility of drawing nato or the international community into this
3016401 weve placed ourselves in a position that globally we dont have the wherewithal to do anything
3016402 we dont have clients who can just stay home and care for themselves
3016403 its not a problem for me im continuing to work
3016404 but for other ombudsmen they cant handle it with the price of gasoline as high as it is now this program is going to greatly suffer
3016405 we have a cash flow that takes us through the end of the month and after that well have to secure a line of credit to pay our vendors
3016406 in order to have a cash flow to pay your paid staff you have to curtail other areas
3016407 its really had a ripple effect on all of our programs
3016408 it takes a lot of effort on the staffs part to really keep an eye on our clients if we cant do these home visits
3016409 but its just how much can you do when you dont have any income coming in
3016410 but the mayas were very intelluctual very smart cunning and witty no they where just an indian tribe with beliefs like all tribes
3016411 they knew about stars that we did not they knew about galaxies that we did not
3016412 can you give the source for this information cause i doubt it how would they know galaxies and stars we didnt know they didnt have telescopes and whatno
3016413 this is a time of total collapse where everything is lost it is the time of the judgement of god there will be epidemics plagues and famine governments will be lost to forgiveness and wise men and prophets will be lost
3016414 a time of misfortune rulers and their subjects separate the people lose faith in their leaders leaders may be harshly treated even hung there is also an abundance of snakes a great famine and few births during this period
3016415 a time of demolition and destruction among the governors an end to the greed but much fighting a time to settle in a new place
3016416 if you wouldnt want it on the cover of the new york times
3016417 i try not to date where i work it makes life easier besides the possibility has never really arisen i dont say no to anybody because id hope that people wouldnt say no to me because im an actor but theyd have to be a pretty extraordinary

3016430 if we do not prefer the church to all other objects of our interest we are unworthy of being counted among her members
3016431 he cannot have god for his father who refuses to have the church for his mother
3016432 for there is no other way to enter into life unless this mother conceive us in her womb give us birth nourish us at her breast and lastly unless she keep us under her care and guidance until putting off mortal flesh we become like the angels

3016434 the renewal of the saints is accomplished and the body of christ is edified
3016435 holds forth the vocal word and it is received by the ears
3016436 what is the rule of life which god has given us
3016437 shows the mark at which we ought to aim the goal towards which we ought to press that each of us according to the measure of grace bestowed upon him may endeavor to frame his life according to the highest rectitude and by constant study continually advance more and more
3016438 believers profit by the law because from it they learn more thoroughly each day what the lords will is like it is as if some servant already prepared with complete earnestness of heart to commend himself to his master must search out and oversee his masters ways in order to conform and accommodate himself to them moreover however much they may be prompted by the spirit and eager to obey god they are still weak in the flesh and would rather serve sin than god the law is to this flesh like a whip to an idle and balky ass to goad stir arouse it to work
3016439 here is the best instrument for them to learn more thoroughly each day the nature of the lords will to which they aspire and to confirm them in the understanding of it
3016440 frequent meditation upon it to be aroused to obedience be strengthened in it and be drawn back from the slippery path of transgression
3016441 for what would be less lovable than the law if with importuning and threatening alone it troubled souls through fear and distressed them through fright
3016442 we obviously have sticking points like in any talks but we look forward to overcome them

3016445 there are estimates that yield loss will be as great as 60 to 80 percent if the fungus attacks when plants are just starting to reproduce
3016446 last year the weather was such that rust invaded the area early in mid september which was unusual in the past it has only developed in middle to late october
3016447 our worry is that the same will happen this year and because of late planting rust developing in mid september could really damage yields
3016448 when rust gets close to missouri and is threatening we will provide daily updates so farmers know what could happen and can prepare to take action if rust does develop
3016449 our effort with the early warning system is to find rust when it first begins to develop in an area because that is the time when farmers would need to apply fungicides to protect their crop
3016450 you could still apply fungicides but yield loss would still occur at that point
3016451 the spores drift with wind currents and can travel for many many miles before they fall out of the sky
3016452 if the spores land on a leaf and dont have some moisture they wont germinate
3016453 current science indicates that these spores need eight to 10 hours of leaf moisture to germinate so the fungus can enter the leaf otherwise the spores will die
3016454 if weather patterns change and rain becomes more frequent in those areas then the disease could start to develop rapidly and spread to this area
3016455 they should rely on us to provide information about the spread of rust we will tell them using all sorts of media when rust has developed
3016456 the heavy metal movement that grew out of post vietnam war era obsession with decadence death and nihilism continues to fascinate me
3016457 we want a government thats for the people by the people

3016466 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
3016467 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
3016468 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
3016469 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water
3016470 swimming research has strived to understand water flow around a swimmer for decades because how a swimmers body moves the surrounding water is everything
3016471 the ability to measure flow and forces in a natural and unimpeded environment hasnt been available until recently and dr weis technology and methods presented usa swimming with a unique opportunity that united states swimmers and coaches could learn a lot from
3016472 how often does a researcher get to do something like this
3016473 its been a journey into a world that someone like me would have never before gotten the privilege to see first hand

3016482 global citizens or global consumers linking your conscience and your wallet
3016483 i think students want to learn about sustainability because they are eager to explore sustainable alternatives to the status quo and be a part of developing these alternatives
3016484 the course looks at where the clothes and food we consume come from how they get to us and how voting with your wallet can matter
3016485 i really enjoyed the class and was disappointed when it ended
3016486 for me this course helped me learn about the power i have as a consumer and it showed me ways in which i can make positive and responsible choices as a global citizen
3016487 students want to learn about this subject it is a hot topic
3016488 the fact that students are willing to spend their lunch learning about climate change says something
3016489 i want students to not only understand the basic science and policy concepts of climate change
3016490 but i want them to be able to explain what they have learned to others
3016491 what works in one area may make matters worse in another
3016492 i am really interested to see what options there are in alternative energy resources and how we can make our world more sustainable
3016493 i always will make it a priority to keep in touch with what the world is currently doing to be more sustainable and how i can influence change
3016494 i believe that people should come out of college knowing more than just science but hopefully living as more responsible global citizens
3016495 this means taking classes where issues like social and environmental sustainability are brought up and students can learn how they can make an impact
3016496 if anyone wants to be first he must be the very last and the servant of all

3016512 es importante tener el coraje de limitarse y la claridad al decidir las prioridades
3016513 aprender a ver que cosa es verdaderamente esencial donde se necesita mi presencia de sacerdote y no puedo delegar a nadie y al mismo tiempo debo aceptar humildemente cuando muchas cosas que tendr a que hacer y donde se exigir a mi presencia no se pueden realizar porque reconozco mis l mites creo que tal humildad ser comprendida por la gente

3016516 ning n sacerdote es un sacerdote solo somos un presbiterio y solo en esta comuni n con el obispo cada uno puede realizar su servicio
3016517 cuando era m s joven era m s severo dec a los sacramentos son los sacramentos de la fe y por lo tanto donde no hay fe no hay praxis de fe entonces el sacramento no puede ser conferido y luego discut a eso cuando era arzobispo de munich con mis p rrocos con el transcurso del tiempo he entendido que debemos seguir siempre el ejemplo del se or que era muy abierto tambi n con las personas al margen de israel de aquel tiempo era un se or de la misericordia bastante abierto seg n muchas autoridades oficiales con los pecadores acogi ndolos o dej ndose acoger en sus cenas atray ndoles a s en su comuni n
3016518 si podemos atisbar siquiera una peque a flama de deseo de la comuni n en la iglesia un deseo tambi n de estos ni os que quieren entrar en comuni n con jes s me parece que es justo ser m s amplio naturalmente cierto debe ser un aspectos de nuestra catequesis hacer entender que la comuni n la primera comuni n no es un hecho puntual sino que exige una continuidad de amistad con jes s un camino con jes s
3016519 en este sentido debemos naturalmente hacer lo posible en el contexto de la preparaci n a los sacramentos para llegar tambi n a los padres y as abrirles tambi n la sensibilidad a ellos en el camino que realizan los ni os deber an ayudar a sus hijos a seguir el propio deseo de entrar en amistad con jes s que es forma de la vida del futuro

3016523 they hedge their bets a little with inflation and it is not clear that inflation has peaked
3016524 im not sure that this adds to the case for a september cut and i dont think it adds to the case for 50 rather than 25 basis points
3016525 in addition to the effects of tighter financial conditions other factors including a slowing in global growth declining asset markets and higher fuel costs are acting to restrain domestic spending and activity
3016526 any further deterioration in the outlook for global growth would represent a significant downside risk to the domestic activity profile particularly if it led to a marked slowing in growth in china and india

3016545 no estaba nerviosa ni presionada pero me bloqueaban mucho las rivales que me conocen bien ve a que no pod a terminar de entrar bien en mi t cnica
3016546 no he podido llegar a mi agarre arriba que me ten an muy estudiado

3016555 wir haben klar dominiert wollten und mussten gegen diesen gegner viele tore schie en da schleichen sich solche unkonzentriertheiten schon mal ein
3016556 se logr pasar pero no nos relajaremos queremos ser primeros
3016557 ser dif cil pues est t cnicamente bien dotado y hay que respetarlo en todos los sentidos adem s hay que tener en cuenta si ganan pueden clasificarse as que pasado ma ana ser n muy peligrosos
3016558 tenemos que jugar serio hemos visto a serbia jugar dos partidos pero contra la selecci n de argentina ser diferente
3016559 el equipo est bien con el cansancio l gico del partido de ayer en el que llovi mucho pero pasado ma ana 19 45 horas en el estadio de los trabajadores de pek n seguro que vamos a estar a tope

3016564 why does this guy only post club penguin funny pics
3016565 siempre espero con inter s y expectativas un torneo y es un aliciente jugar con los grandes tenistas en wimbledon por ejemplo me enfrent a roger federer antes de lo que me hubiera gustado pero una segunda ronda es extremadamente pronto para jugar contra el mejor jugador de la actualidad pero es un buen momento para derrotarle
3016566 no s como puedo encontrarme ante nadal he entrenado poco esta ltima semana y media no es la mejor preparaci n me hubiera gustado haberme ejercitado m s
3016567 eso fue hace unos a os pero ambos hemos protagonizado uno de los mejores encuentros en un grand slam en el abierto de australia cuando gan en cinco sets cuando jugaba realmente bien pero no es una referencia que valga ahora despu s en tierra me ha ganado alguno con facilidad tengo algunas opciones pero no hay duda de que es complicado
3016568 son habituales en las finales y han jugado un gran tenis son dos grandes reclamos por lo tanto es evidente que el torneo elevar a su perfil si se encontraran en la final
3016569 sobre todo porque han tenido una rivalidad singular en los dos o tres ltimos a os y porque rafa ya ha llegado a la parte alta de la clasificaci n eso lo ve gente incluso que no sigue el tenis
3016570 yo creo que no hay una gran diferencia entre ambos cada uno tiene sus recursos pero est n en un punto similar
3016571 esta vez lo voy a conseguir no pienso en el pasado
3016572 todos los que estamos aqu so amos con una medalla
3016573 todos los que estamos aqu so amos con una medalla de bronce para arriba
3016574 tuve suerte porque inicialmente iba a jugar con ivan ljubicic que se dio de baja por lesi n y entr el baham s devin mulling que no conoc a me fue bien jugu concentrado y no le subestim trat de no pensar en su r nking sino en hacer mi juego y ganar
3016575 hac a un mes que no compet a por la lesi n de hombro que tuve en stuttgart el hombro no me molest y creo que ir a m s cuando pasan los d as nos vamos encontrando mejor m s aclimatados
3016576 lo l gico este a o es que nadal fuera n mero uno del mundo en alg n momento y de forma justa ten a que serlo pero tambi n hay que valorar a roger que para la mayor a es el mejor jugador de la historia del tenis roger baj este a o y rafa sigui igual para m era justo que fuera n mero uno del mundo
3016577 todav a no tengo ritmo tras tanto tiempo lesionado he hecho muy poco f tbol y por lo tanto todav a tengo que recuperar ese ritmo tanto de partidos como f sico y despu s ya veremos voy despacito y siguiendo lo planificado ahora lo importante es ir cogiendo ritmo de juego y de partido pero siempre con cautela
3016578 la competencia es dura y buena va a estar lindo este a o luchar por un puesto en el equipo y lo va a estar en todas las l neas ya que hay jugadores de nivel en todas las demarcaciones y es algo bueno para el equipo y para lo que busca la instituci n
3016579 es bueno que hayamos mantenido la base y m s tras un a o como el que hemos pasado
3016580 hay otros equipos que han cambiado mucho m s su equipo y nosotros somos m s o menos los mismos con pocas novedades
3016581 es un buen torneo y complicado frente a equipos de nivel
3016582 nos servir para seguir prepar ndonos para el inicio del campeonato
3016583 los ltimos d as de la negociaci n fueron complicados sab a que todo se arreglar a
3016584 el equipo est bien tiene mucho futuro y se puede hacer muy buena temporada es un gran equipo pero hay que confirmarlo porque tiene a grandes futbolistas y la competencia ser grande
3016585 aldo duscher debe ser el ltimo fichaje para la esta temporada
3016586 un jugador conocido que atesora m s de trescientos partidos como profesional en espa a
3016587 es el momento de entrar entre los mejores de europa
3016588 es la primera vez que voy a jugar una previa de la champions y es la primera vez que tengo la ocasi n de poder disputar esta competici n el atl tico de madrid ha sido mi nico equipo en europa hemos pasado cuatro a os dif ciles y es el momento de entrar entre los mejores y no salir de ese grupo
3016589 pasar la eliminatoria ser a un premio para nosotros una recompensa a todo el esfuerzo que hemos hecho a lo largo de estos a os
3016590 todo futbolista sue a con jugar una competici n como la champions
3016591 la verdad es que cuando ves al resto de equipos hacerlo sientes una envidia sana lo m s importante ahora es pensar que tenemos dos partidos por delante que debemos superar y aprovechar la oportunidad que se nos presenta porque si no lo hacemos ahora no sabemos cu ndo se nos puede volver a presentar el grupo sabe que ya no hay marcha atr s
3016592 llevamos esperando este momento hace cuatro a os todos estamos muy ilusionados hay nuevos fichajes que han venido a ayudar y a reforzar al equipo este a o se repite algo que ya exist a la temporada pasada y es que la plantilla est muy comprometida
3016593 es un conjunto que jugando de local se muestra muy firme y muy seguro pues ataca mucho nosotros tenemos que estar ordenados jugar con cabeza y aprovechar las opciones que se generen
3016594 vamos a jugar el partido sabiendo que tenemos por delante 180 minutos si sacamos una peque a ventaja en el partido de vuelta en nuestra casa y con nuestro p blico podemos rematar la faena todo el mundo sabe que el atl tico de madrid hace mucho tiempo que no est en la liga de campeones as que es una oportunidad que tenemos y no podemos dejarla pasar este equipo tiene mucha calidad y eso va a ser suficiente para dar un paso m s
3016595 es dif cil asegurar que llegaremos en el estado f sico ptimo pero esta clase de partidos se juegan muy pocas veces en la vida y tienes que entregar lo mucho o lo poco que tengas pienso que llegaremos bien el equipo est preparado para pasar la eliminatoria y con la ayuda de dios lo vamos a conseguir
3016596 uno siempre espera que la gente te apoye y est ah animando al equipo nosotros vamos a responder porque vamos a dar el m ximo en el campo ahora es momento de que el equipo est concentrado y tranquilo porque al final somos nosotros los que jugamos y los que podemos sacar esto adelante

3016635 that feeling of being powerful and sexy in those shoes
3016636 living like you mean it use the wisdom and power of your emotions to get the life you really want
3016637 a natural high that pleasant feeling one experiences during and after a certain activity like running or strenuous exercise has to do with the release of endorphins as well as other mood regulating hormones such as adrenaline serotonin cortisol and melatonin orgasm also produces a flood of endorphins which is what makes us feel calm and relaxed after sex
3016638 when you pull yourself up onto a summit and climax so to speak particularly as a woman the sheer physicality beauty and endurance are like no other feeling on earth
3016639 i fell to my knees it was one of the best moments of my life

3016641 not too much not too little just enough to make you want more each course gets you progressively closer to tantalizing your taste buds even more the entire three hour buildup is incredible
3016642 being overly active or addicted to working out as a means to regulate ones anxiety
3016643 research has shown that addictive substances like alcohol nicotine and heroin activate a single pleasure circuit in the deepest and oldest part of the brain
3016644 people become addicted to these substances because their systems become used to higher levels of dopamine and when they dont get it feel deprived a drug floods the brain with dramatic levels of dopamine that are not the same as what is produced during a natural high
3016645 but they dont have the same propensity to become addictive
3016646 i had told him not to and when i asked why he did it he said he just couldnt resist
3016647 ive seen plenty of disgusted and disgruntled parents come in with phone bills in the hundreds of dollars for their kids
3016648 and then theres the fact that kids will be kids they play rough with and lose their toys a phone will be no different
3016649 theres a huge difference between feeling safer and being safer
3016650 a cell phone is with the person who controls it and most parents dont check cell phones
3016651 we do not have enough information nor do we have enough time to be sure that cell phones are safe and theres reason for concern that they may be harmful
3016652 i was so busy with school and sports that i rarely used the phone
3016653 its just like anything else and you have to monitor it

3016659 the real surprise is that its so much easier than you would think
3016660 if you hang on its like dieting the hunger goes away
3016661 i dont see that as being bad for the economy
3016662 there are different levels of adherence its what makes sense to your economic or personal conditions

3016674 we recognize what we can and cannot do and we try to keep the budget down
3016675 its no secret that weve had to endure some revenue losses but were watching it very closely and hopefully well be ok in 2009
3016676 we dont have enough money to address these building needs
3016677 we are just in no position to take that kind of debt in the budget
3016678 hes not doling out 5 6 and 7 percent raises like other towns but when the town did vote in the debt exclusion he went out and built a library and a police station that are the taj mahals of dracut
3016679 sure town meeting approved it but look at the makeup over 45 percent of the voters were town officials or people related to town officials
3016680 we would not be where we are today if not for dennis piendak
3016681 he watches every single dollar that comes in and goes out and he doesnt let any of us wander off the path
3016682 there is no question that dennis piendak is the reason that dracut hasnt had the trouble that other towns are facing
3016683 he has amazing instincts and he will only spend to the level that can be funded
3016684 i think everyone including dennis learned a lesson from that
3016685 it was one of those things that had a profound effect on the town
3016686 nobody who was here then will ever forget it i think many people dennis piendak included resolved that nothing like this would ever happen again

3016717 i can not say that it will be ended today but i am optimistic that in the near future we will come into solution whether it happens today tomorrow or day after tomorrow i do not think anyone knows at this stage

3016739 dat als hij niet geholpen wordt hij aan die wond zal sterven en dat zou heel jammer zijn

3016756 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia

3016758 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3016759 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia

3016771 the shortage of english translators and interpreters is becoming acute in all international organisations
3016772 this portal is the first time microsoft looking for feedback from customers who are using the localized interface we want them to send feedback to microsoft telling us how they feel about the translation
3016773 if you are dealing with linguistic experts and they just translate from english to arabic this could have meaning for them but we need to understand the actual user of the language interface the most common users for us are in the public sector education and older people who prefer the arabic interface so we need to ask them how they feel about the translation does it make sense sometimes you can translate linguistically but it does not make sense for the users
3016774 its difficult to praise rob without insinuating that there was something not great about his predecessor and ive got nothing but respect and love for former metallica bassist jason newsted

3016787 i am a christian and i am a devout christian i believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of jesus christ i believe that that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life but most importantly i believe in the example that jesus set by feeding the hungry and healing the sick and always prioritizing the least of these over the powerful i didnt fall out in church as they say but there was a very strong awakening in me of the importance of these issues in my life i didnt want to walk alone on this journey accepting jesus christ in my life has been a powerful guide for my conduct and my values and my ideals there is one thing that i want to mention that i think is important part of what weve been seeing during the course this campaign is some scurrilous e mails that have been sent out denying my faith talking about me being a muslim suggesting that i got sworn in the u s senate with a quran in my hand or that i dont pledge allegiance to the flag i think its really important for your readers to know that i have been a member of the same church for almost 20 years and i have never practiced islam i am respectful of the religion but its not my own one of the things thats very important in this day and age is that we dont use religion as a political tool and certainly that we dont lie about religion as a way to score political points i just thought it was important to get that in there to dispel rumors that have been over the internet weve done so repeatedly but obviously its a political tactic of somebody to try to provide this misinformation

3017029 enniskillen was virtually a no go area for all of saturday because of the day long parading by bands from the loyal orders many local people have said that they felt like prisoners in the town
3017030 it was difficult for local people to get into town to do their shopping on one of the towns busiest shopping days it was also very detrimental to shoppers coming across the border from the south which have become a very important market for local retailers
3017031 there is also a huge impact on the local tourism industry any tourist wanting to visit the town would have been totally frustrated
3017032 there was an impact right across the county with loyalists getting off buses just to parade through small villages both to and from the main demonstration in enniskillen the organisers have to ask themselves what is the benefit to this type of excessive triumphalist coat trailing
3017033 there appeared to be no contingency plan in place to keep traffic moving in and out of the town
3017034 i am pleased to confirm the preferred route for this strategically important road scheme
3017035 gregory campbells reaction to my challenge was disgraceful he refused to confirm if he would work with loyalists to ensure that people do not have to live with these threats hanging over them

3017063 it is regrettable that a member of the national executive committee nec of the anc is publicly dismissing and denouncing free education as a pipe dream
3017064 we view these remarks as nonsensical and distasteful simply because they are clearly undermining the anc resolutions and the principle of democratic centralism
3017065 these remarks are also an attack on the continuous struggles waged by both the students and youth movements in smashing the colonial and capitalist orientated education system in our country
3017066 a reminder to our people that beneficiaries of patronage and those in high echelons of power are hell bent in undermining the gains made in polokwane including its progressive resolutions
3017067 it will be prudent that we safeguard and defend the polokwane outcomes even if it means we have to go to the streets in protest
3017068 it is our contention as the ycl that the ministry of education is not an advanced english college but is a government institution which needs to conform and comply with the policies of the ruling party the anc
3017069 south africa must offer free education when it can afford it steps must be taken progressively to get to that free education
3017070 but can we say lets have free education tomorrow unfortunately the reality of the situation is that we cannot

3017153 the detection of a new avian influenza virus strain in africa raises serious concerns as it remains unknown how this strain has been introduced to the continent
3017154 it seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007 and this years southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3017155 it could well be that there are other channels for virus introduction international trade for example or illegal and unreported movement of poultry this increases the risk of avian influenza spread to other countries in western africa

3017171 told us that of all certificate courses our college has only accredited an it course on the other hand the principal said that he had sent documents for accreditation to the institution and they lost them he said he then some again and they were being processed hence it appeared that our courses were not accredited
3017172 you can see for yourself we have been registered and accredited
3017173 our client further indicates that before the imposition of ntime the constituency election committee had confirmed him as the sole parliamentary candidate for the botswana national front in gaborone north in a properly convened constituency meeting

3017177 the largest annual depreciation was 14 2 percent against the euro and the least was 2 3 percent against the us dollar while remaining unchanged against the pound
3017178 it is certainly an important exhibition for the mining industry in both botswana and south africa
3017179 we want to network in order to have more business partners in botswana than we already have at present
3017180 involved in voter trafficking by registering people from as far as borolong village which is outside the constituency
3017181 why do you take some of these things so serious especially during campaigns politicians can say anything especially when they want to discredit their opponents
3017182 we are most excited about the growth potential of the project
3017183 since june last year our share prices have gone up by 400 per cent
3017184 the good thing about the shareholding structure is that on the botswana component most of these shares are held by individual batswana together with investec botswana
3017185 at the same time we will be assessing the project potential to match the resource base we are most excited about the growth potential of the project
3017186 up to 95 percent chalcocite recovery plus 80 percent malachite recovery and 65 80 percent silver recovery
3017187 to date only three percent of the potentially mineralised strike length has been explored a regional exploration programme continues across discovery metals highly prospective tenement package and the rest of the 1 300 strike kilometres of interest to us this programme has already generated significant success with the identification of a significant copper anomaly in soils at quirinus and the subsequent discovery of copper silver mineralisation by reverse circulation drilling a preliminary diamond drilling programme is now underway to further explore and develop this prospect
3017188 a preliminary feasibility study focusing on developing the open pit potential of this resource and two mtpa concentrator is currently nearing completion we intend that the first seven 10 years to have an open cast operation and then we might have to go underground though that could be expensive
3017189 admittedly water could be a problem but we are looking at the option of underground water we are particularly going to target deep underground salty aquifers
3017190 if dumbarton folk arent going to come to hear you preach your words may be appreciated more by others
3017191 when we see whats happening today wont that bolster john mccains argument that the presidency needs someone with experience dealing with issues like these
3017192 i think the two concerns that americans have are the state of our economy and our security at home and abroad and this issue in georgia obviously raises great questions but i think as we look at security what americans most want is judgment experience is only positive insofar as it creates good judgment and i think senator obamas strong case to the american people is that he will have the right judgment about how to balance americas military force with strong diplomacy to protect our interests abroad he has spoken very strongly about the need to protect georgias integrity and sovereignty has called on russia to cease fire in the region and called on the international community to begin talks to protect georgian sovereignty but i think americans really and i know virginians better than those in other states what we want is judgment
3017193 my view is that the united states if we had a stronger relationship with russia we could exercise strong diplomacy to stop this effort against georgia we should immediately go to the united nations security council condemn russias action and then get the security council to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint and possibly at the same time generate some u n peacekeeping troops the problem though is that we dont have the kind of influence and strength in our relationship with russia to persuade them this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory
3017194 i think it was wrong for senator obama to try to focus on a mccain adviser rather than actually listening to what mccain had to say about the policy rather than recognizing mccains years and years of experience when it comes to international affairs this is a very serious international crisis
3017195 senator obama has said lets use diplomacy i believe what senator mccain is proposing is totally totally wrong keeping them out of the g 8 russia is a major superpower we have to build the kind of relationship with russia so that we can deal with them on restraining iran from building nuclear weapons so that we can deal with russia in the middle east help us in the situation in iraq senator obamas policy of diplomacy of building international support for our goals makes sense what senator mccain wants to do is continue the bush policies of trying to isolate russia you know build this missile system there find ways to be aggressive against russia its not working and russia doesnt respect our efforts to try to restrain them so i believe what senator obama is proposing international diplomacy build a strong relationship with countries like russia and china find the united nations as a vehicle to bring this crisis possibly to an end thats what we need
3017196 governor richardson the mccain campaign put out a very forceful statement calling the situation in georgia dire and blaming russia heres the obama campaigns response they said quote john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government now georgia is a strong u s ally is that really an appropriate response to such a serious international crisis to blame the mccain campaigns position on one of his advisers
3017197 the mccain campaign is getting very negative senator mccain is the washington celebrity here his campaign is run by lobbyists that represent georgia and other countries his campaign is negative he changes positions he takes huge amounts of money from oil companies that are profiting in the soviet union and many parts of the world this is a campaign run by lobbyists so we have a washington celebrity campaign going on and its negative and the american people want to see the good positive positions of both candidates and the best part about senator obamas campaign is he can bring people together hes uplifting of the american people he can bring republicans and democrats together to deal with energy with the economy and many other important issues that affect this country
3017198 on the political front if one might be so crass as to raise politics here i think its an interesting question going forward about what this will make people think vis a vis senator obama and senator mccain senator mccain has been to south ossetia a place that most americans probably hadnt paid a lot of attention to beforehand he came out with a much stronger much more anti russian less even handed if you will statement immediately after the hostilities broke out will people look at this and say we still live in a dangerous world we feel better with senator mccain there he knows this area or will they look at this and say boy we are already embroiled in places that we would prefer not to be is senator mccain going to get us elsewhere and i think thats going to be an interesting state of discussion going forward
3017199 it is and particularly a moment where john mccain can claim to be been pressured because in his basic foreign policy speech two months ago and in an interview that i did with him last week he draws a very sharp line when it comes to russia because these people are being aggressive and imperialist there is no confusion in his mind about the character of the putin medvedev government and he is prepared i think to unmake the case that this is a demonstration of exactly what he has been arguing for
3017200 this is a resurgent russia and i think whether obama or mccain is president they will have to deal with it the good news is the problem of having a united europe europe figured out they have experience with imperialist russia i think who ever the next president can maybe fashion a tougher foreign policy
3017201 is the obama camp ok with a roll call at the convention in which delegates can vote openly for either clinton or obama
3017202 i can tell you this i dont know what decision has been made if there is a final decision on that question but i can tell you this hillary clinton and president clinton are integral parts of our convention in denver hillary clinton will be speaking tuesday night in prime time president clinton will be speaking wednesday night their people are not only welcome to this convention we need their help now lets understand weve gone through a bruising primary season between these two excellent candidates and there are some people still healing from that i understand it but in the end i believe that the hillary clinton supporters and hillary herself are definitely committed to obamas candidacy
3017203 look what happened just a day or two ago here was hillary clinton in nevada campaigning for barack obama on the issue of pay equity so that women are treated fairly in the workplace an issue which john mccain disagrees with obama on and disagrees with hillary clinton there are clear differences between the candidates and hillary clinton is going to be supporting barack obama and encouraging all of her voters to do the same
3017204 but just a simple question sir do you think a roll call is a good idea or not
3017205 im not going to speak to that because i dont know what decision has been reached at the convention trust me the hillary clinton delegates will be treated fairly we welcome them we need them if were going to win in november their support is critical
3017206 i have a great feeling all of the democratic forces whoever they were supporting before coming together and the clinton camp and obama camps have come together very well in virginia you know look competition can create some challenging feelings but the democrats have shown again and again that we get on board and that we work together the stakes are very very high i know that both senator clinton and president clinton will have key roles in the convention and i expect that once were there that everybody is going to be together in a great way to do a historic job of turning out democratic voters and also independent and disgruntled republican voters for barack obama in november
3017207 i dont know the answer im just happy to be the governor of the fourth largest state in america its a state of almost 20 million people and its great to always be in florida
3017208 im going to move on but quick question have they started a formal vetting process with you in other words are they asking for documents irs returns stuff like that
3017209 i cant discuss the process wolf i hope you appreciate that
3017210 you take it however you want i cant discuss the process
3017211 i didnt say that i thought he ought to i said that i thought he probably would pick a red state democrat because i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities as president
3017212 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years
3017213 hes got to be very frustrated because he does understand whats happening in that region hes been in georgia i know hes met with opposition leaders in georgia and i dont know that hes going to get the credit for that because what happens i think when a party in an administration has lost the faith of the american public as much as this administration has anything happens thats destabilizing that makes you feel threatened or that feels like bad news becomes a reinforcement of mismanagement in a sense
3017214 i think that he needs to have somebody at his side so that if any one of these things comes up in the next few months not to mention the next few years that america feels oh that person might know whats going on yes this is going to be a problem most people have not heard of south ossetia its hard to get your mind wrapped around it and to care about it much unless it looks like a danger to europe and to us and thats where russia comes in
3017215 well and its not just this part of the world but senator mccain has been to so many exotic places like waziristan and south ossetia and hes very comfortable with these issues he knows what he thinks hes been involved in these places for many many years and so its just sort of a perfect thing for him and so the question is each time something like this pops up randomly we may see a cautiousness on the one hand by senator obama who has not been dealing with these things for years and maybe a little more aggressive voice from senator mccain
3017216 mccain its not just that hes experienced mccain was right about putin he warned about russia under putins ambitions he wanted russia excluded from the g 8 bush went with the mainstream i guess of lets be nicer to them no its a big problem to cross international borders with a massive armed assault which has not stopped which has now gone way beyond south ossetia theyre bombing the capital of georgia airfields the fleets moving into the black sea theres a possible showdown with ukraine coming if russia gets away with this the precedent will be awful and this is a very big moment i think for russia to invade a neighboring nation
3017217 i have to congratulate the democratic electorate on their wisdom in not nominating him if they had they would be in desperate straits right now i agree with john edwards former campaign manager saying he betrayed us he betrayed all the people who supported him
3017218 i dont know where we would be right now if john edwards had upon the democratic nomination we would be sitting here talking about an open convention we would be talking about rebellions among edwards delegates it would be an absolute mess
3017219 we are just a small neighbourhood business nothing illegal going on here

3017249 the first time i laid eyes on rielle hunter i could tell she was a story
3017250 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3017251 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
3017252 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
3017253 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
3017254 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital
3017255 shes devastated however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her
3017256 they had 30 years of marriage thats unprecedented in todays time particularly for celebrities that brings joy to her they loved each other and respected each other on a daily basis she was by his side to the very end
3017257 when they started dating he said girl you better come on board this train because im going to be rich and her response was okay and they were married thats how he charmed her with his sense of humor
3017258 when they got married they were kids he was 20 and she was 19 they both grew up together and they both matured in this marriage
3017259 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly

3017303 i think this unifying way of looking at the illegal immigrants as a coherent population also deviates from the dialogue when you want to talk about statistics and truth
3017304 i think that in the same way that some groups do not make the link between the economy and migration the same can be said that we cannot make immediate links between enforcement and migration

3017336 every individual generally indeed neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it by preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry he intends only his own security and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value he intends only his own gain and he is in this as in many other cases led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention

3017350 from the beginning of third day we realized that we needed to have someone to speak into our lives as individuals and as a band through the years we have had many people pastors and friends travel with us but of all those people nigel james has been the most important he has allowed us and reminded us to be men of god first and as a result our music and ministry have reflected that nigel has kept us accountable to each other to the church and of course to our lord he has helped us to grow in our faith and has reminded us to stay focused on our calling and on what third day is really all about
3017351 how did you get the job of third days road pastor
3017352 for just as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts
3017353 at another paramount theme park third day talked me into going on the top gun ride with them a frightening experience
3017354 wow these third day guys must be incredible even their guitar tech is a mighty man of god
3017355 leading a bible study with third day today supposedly didnt think newsboys bus would arrive at the venue in time got here with twenty minutes to spare washed and ate only to find all the guys in third day still asleep
3017356 for the kingdom of god is not a matter of talk but of power
3017357 but we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from god and not from us

3017360 kanye west called two months ago while i was making supper
3017361 i listen to the song and try to find an unusual angle
3017362 i dont just want to illustrate the song i want to do something that expands its universe its all about creating tension between the music and the images
3017363 these things work best when theres some kind of personal story when you feel something real is happening thats what does it for me
3017364 i try to strike the right tone to grasp what it is the band want to bring out of their music
3017365 the raveonettes for example like the 50s thing and im pretty nuts about it too
3017366 im really impressed by the new stuff theyre better today than back then theyre more tasteful they probably learned from our mistakes
3017367 i think it has to do with the fact that the music scene has changed danish music used to be all bubblegum pop like aqua but in recent years there has been a reaction against that and rock has been more to the fore so we have bands like mew spleen united and nephew who want something different from their videos
3017368 a change has taken place resulting in a more productive scene the more people have enjoyed success making videos the more others have thrown themselves into it hopefully this means that more talent will emerge
3017369 a video should add something to the music it should complement the song in a way the viewer didnt see coming
3017370 their earlier videos were more poppy and i thought it would be interesting to draw out the darkness that i could sense in their universe
3017371 i dont exactly get less ambitious with each video i make which goes against the grain of the record companies priorities
3017372 there seems to be less and less money available for each video i can see it from their perspective but less money will mean poorer quality
3017373 there are lots of bands who want to do something interesting but nobody dares put money into it
3017374 he sent me the whole album i chose two songs and sketched out concepts for them he wants to do both but i think i can only manage one

3017385 ive seen plenty of disgusted and disgruntled parents come in with phone bills in the hundreds of dollars for their kids
3017386 and then theres the fact that kids will be kids they play rough with and lose their toys a phone will be no different
3017387 theres a huge difference between feeling safer and being safer
3017388 a cell phone is with the person who controls it and most parents dont check cell phones
3017389 we do not have enough information nor do we have enough time to be sure that cell phones are safe and theres reason for concern that they may be harmful
3017390 i was so busy with school and sports that i rarely used the phone
3017391 its just like anything else and you have to monitor it

3017395 more pleasure than you could ever imagine ive become addicted
3017396 a pretty amusing if silly sex romp that will most likely fit the bill if you are looking for something naughty to read
3017397 with her usual strength of character sense of fun and powerfully passionate prose portia da costa shows us that even the lifeless hearts of the undead can still beat with the stirrings of romance
3017398 hotbed is a perfect showcase for portia da costas inestimable talent
3017399 suite seventeen contains all portias trademark treats from the arousing narrative a wicked blend of deviant episodes and an undercurrent of pragmatic and poignant romance

3017422 ba and american airlines will argue that their alliance is now acceptable because the competitive environment has changed with the open skies accord on uk us routes
3017423 this is a complete red herring open skies which is only a temporary accord as it may be unwound in 2010 has not significantly increased competition on uk london us routes
3017424 the job of the regulators is to assess the long term impact of the alliance on competition not to provide special protection from the immediate challenges of the economic cycle with which every other airline has to deal with
3017425 ba american airlines would have a combination of high frequencies and a transatlantic network that could not be replicated by any other airline or alliance and which would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travellers
3017426 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3017427 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3017428 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3017429 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3017430 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3017431 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3017432 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3017433 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3017439 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3017440 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3017441 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3017442 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
3017443 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight
3017444 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then

3017468 obama started negative campaigning on john mccain long before we started punching back and i think a lot of our effort is really to get back into this game try and galvanize some of the public attention back onto this race make sure everybody understands theres two people in this race not just one and i think weve been successful in doing that

3017472 all i know is i am very proud of the relationships he has established with different leaders
3017473 its also russian prime minister vladimir putin he gets criticized for that but i think its smart and wise and right that he has pleasant relationships with people and that they trust him i think hes developing that with french president nicolas sarkozy i know its there with putin
3017474 it doesnt mean you approve of what putin is doing or his denial of human rights in russia thats the thing that gets me about some of these critics they think if you establish a personal relationship that youre then signing off on everything that person does and thats not right

3017487 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilise this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america

3017512 i think for the time being as long as inflation is still running up i dont think the mas will shift its stance
3017513 it currently has sgd against the sgd neer model on appreciation bias so i dont think it will shift their inflation or change their monetary policy stance as yet
3017514 but inflation does show sustainable signs of cooling off and if it stays down for a minimum of three months then perhaps mas will shift to a more neutral stance
3017515 are we going to see the singapore dollar weakening significantly i dont think so
3017516 mas is still maintaining its upward bias in terms of the policy band that means on a trade weighted basis the singapore dollar will still be allowed to appreciate on a gradual basis
3017517 as a whole if the dollar continues on a weaker mode we should see the singapore dollar probably ending the year about s 1 38 or so maybe even the previous forecast of s 1 35 though this may be difficult to hit but i think s 1 38 or s 1 40 we should see those levels by the end of year

3017524 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3017525 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3017526 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3017527 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3017528 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3017529 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3017530 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3017531 there is a significant need in biology to be able to image at high resolution
3017532 metamaterials would be a better optical imaging method since it would be non invasive
3017533 in the case of such cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock
3017534 an observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it making it seem to disappear
3017535 to scale up such a material to sizes visible to the naked eye will be very time consuming and very costly
3017536 the fish net structure is counter intuitive because as we stack the material in layers the energy loss is reduced instead of increased

3017566 he knew all the right things to say and i used to believe him until i would get this icy blast of reality
3017567 he threatened to stab me in the heart he punched me in the head
3017568 they thought he was going to kill me and they didnt want to come to my tangi
3017569 but they dont realise i still have incredible feelings for him

3017593 the frequency of these images and references dont make any sense unless youre trying to send the message that obama could be the antichrist
3017594 if they wanted to be funny if they really wanted to play up the idea that obama thinks hes the second coming there were better ways to do it
3017595 why use these awkward lines like and the world will receive his blessings
3017596 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance

3017656 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
3017657 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
3017658 as under the russians in chechnya it looks like the communists in china are battling another form of totalitarianism to come jihadism
3017659 china will continue to pursue a policy of support to other jihadist forces including the islamist regime in khartoum
3017660 a new afghanistan with jihadists converging from central asia and other parts of the world
3017661 a turkistan islamist movement with links in central asia stretching back to afghanistan and pakistan blending taliban training
3017662 is a very different entity than china has faced in the past
3017663 beijing would be unable to use information from raiding one cell to find another this appears to be exactly what we are seeing now the central tip core uses the internet and videos as psychological tools to trigger a reaction from beijing and inspire militants without exposing itself to detection or capture
3017664 the alleged activities seem to fit a pattern within the international jihadist movement of paying more attention to china islamists have considered china something less imperialistic and thus less threatening than the united states and european powers but this began changing with the launch of the sco shanghai cooperative organization designed to monitor terrorism in russian and asia and the trend has been accelerating with chinas expanded involvement in africa and central asia and its continued support for pakistans government
3017665 opportunistically using the post 11 september environment to make the outrageous claim that individuals disseminating peaceful religious and cultural messages in xinjiang are terrorists who have simply changed tactics
3017666 they dont espouse violence they espouse sharia does china want to live under sharia do free people want to live under sharia does it matter that hizb ut tahrir wont be blowing anyone up on its way to instituting this oppressive system
3017667 the beijing games are our one last golden opportunity to inflict such attacks on china even though we know we are weak like an egg on a stone we will try to smear the stone

3017672 i cracked the door open but they pushed me out of the way
3017673 there was an atmosphere of war about to break out from my point of view the battles of the past few days were to be expected
3017674 we have good relations with russia and georgia and dont want to back either in this conflict we therefore made a decision to drastically minimize sales of weapons to georgia
3017675 the last temptation of christ based on the novel by greek author nikos kazantzakis
3017676 disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now
3017677 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
3017678 inventing matamoras gender and the forgotten islamic past in the united states of america

3017684 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
3017685 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
3017686 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
3017687 but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
3017688 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
3017689 being on a database that can be exchanged throughout the world or hacked into
3017690 we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families
3017691 because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom
3017692 thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws

3017707 this is still the worst case of fraud in us history and we are not going away with just three settlements
3017708 as far as we are concerned every bank or stock brokerage firm involved in the auction rate securities fraud is little more than a pitiful lying cockroach of a company you call your institutions you are nothing more than thieves that deceived 150 000 unsuspecting us citizens out of what in many cases was their life savings pay up or we start getting specific
3017709 there has been so much lying and deception involving auction rate securities that we cannot believe people are not going to jail as an example on friday august 8 2008 a commentator on cnbc described auction rate securities victims as rich people
3017710 this was a pathetic lie one only need see who advertises on cnbc in order to gain insight into this perspective
3017711 most of the 2000 individuals we have talked to in the last five plus months have been senior citizens or working class people who trusted a lying stock broker or a bank investment adviser with the words just like cash safe liquid etc
3017712 americas watchdog expects the vrdn market place aka municipals to collapse because of the erosion of city county or state tax revenues if a consumer has these types of investments they may not be safe
3017713 americas watchdog expects more us bank failures and a further us real estate market devaluation in 2009 of at least 10 in states like california it could be 20 this valuation erosion has far reaching implications that will put at risk the entire economy any us bank that has exposure to pay option adjustable rate mortgages or large portfolios of second mortgages is cooked if the second mortgage was originated before 2007 chances are its now worthless
3017714 if us consumers have wall street type investments it may be a great time to park your money in a federally insured account auction rate securities are just the beginning its going to get much worse much riskier and many us consumers will lose it all
3017715 gosh thats what we think wall street investment bankers stock brokers banks and mortgage bankers have been doing to us consumers and now as it turns out the us taxpayer since 2003
3017716 when gillian first showed me this amazing property last year i was completely blown away
3017717 you just dont see this caliber of property with these features in the sunset plaza area
3017718 although the house was perfectly livable as it was davis had a much more grand scheme in mind
3017719 the second i saw this property i knew it was a one of kind diamond in the rough you could feel sammy davis jr frank sinatra and the whole rat pack hanging out in the cabana not to mention that judy garland also lived here at one time amazing
3017720 i knew this had to go to someone who could appreciate how special and rare this compound is with its rich hollywood history and restore it with the love it deserves i immediately thought of rob davis

3017722 todays real estate and economic climates require an even greater emphasis on conceiving and executing comprehensive marketing and sales programs that are innovative creative and credible were confident that our experience in leading clients through similar market conditions will prove to be a tremendous asset as we execute these unique campaigns
3017723 this was a strategic acquisition in a dynamic market extra space is the 3rd property ebs has acquired in texas this month we expect to close on four more assets in texas prior to the end of september the texas economy is rapidly expanding and we are well poised to benefit from the growth
3017724 this is a great economic stabilization project in a great area
3017725 we have a lot of confidence in austin and believe that we will quickly bring this facility to a stabilized maximum economic occupancy and realize explosive growth in value over the next 24 months
3017726 ebs has by far the best property management team and the best property management systems in the self storage industry this allows

3017746 however the capital poured into agriculture accounts for only 14 per cent of total investment and most of that was raised from non state companies
3017747 the sectors gross domestic product gdp growth has slowed down
3017748 at present farmers have been forced to accept prices of fertilizers and pesticides set by traders
3017749 the thing that constantly amazes me about the opposition is if you look at the lowest tax states in the country they are not the states with the fastest growing economy they are not the states with the best schools they are not the states that have the most jobs or the lowest unemployment rate
3017750 if every delegate was to retire from the house after the special session we would have a wonderful mechanism a transportation bill which i promise you would include a gas tax
3017751 most farmers in the area were involved in forestry and raised cattle which earned them about vnd30 40 million 1 800 2 500 per year i wanted to try something more profitable and thought that fish farming was suitable as we have a good climate and cheap labour in lai chau province
3017752 my first 3 000 fish died due to unusually hot weather and my lack of experience
3017753 salmon are temperamental fish and require water to be between 18 20 degree celsius and fish feed must be imported from france however it is very difficult to adjust the water temperature in reservoirs
3017754 it was my first time fish farming i learnt from books friends and training courses but that was not enough i had to explore other techniques
3017755 weather conditions water quality and fish feed are the main factors in whether or not you can successfully raise salmon after my first failure i went to china to learn more and did further research
3017756 i want to invest more as supply does not meet demand i cannot fulfil orders from many customers in ha noi hai phong and even japan
3017757 salmon raising provides a stable income i hope to share my experience so other farmers can get involved in this business apart from knowledge capital is also crucial it is not easy for a farmer to invest the vnd100 million 6 200 needed
3017758 bank officials help us a lot and often come to our farms to check everything is going smoothly

3017783 we have been documenting this water mass for years near greenland
3017784 it was almost impossible to provide evidence of it since 2004
3017785 for these purposes we had to relocate the equipment anchored at the seafloor last year further to the north to follow the receding ice and to ascertain that they stood at least temporarily in the sphere of influence of the ice edge
3017786 for instance weve learned that when someone has a haploid insufficiency and is missing one copy of the tgf gene he or she is more vulnerable to environmental insults that can cause cleft palate such as drugs smoking and alcohol
3017787 we found that if we blocked tgf or the receptors a cleft palate develops
3017788 but when smad4 was blocked normal palate epithelium still covered the palatal shelf
3017789 this information is useful not just for palate and teeth but also for cancer and cell biology in general
3017790 ultimately we have to be translational in order to make ourselves useful to patients
3017791 they let me know about as much as i will tell you
3017792 thats because they know i will tell you i will tell you too much i have done that before it just slips out because i get so excited about the role
3017793 it is interesting this year because she is sort of her own boss shes really not taking orders
3017794 that makes her a little more dangerous and a little more wily
3017795 i said the kid is fine i havent killed him i promise i told her i wasnt supposed to tell her that but was going to tell her because she was very angry
3017796 he has the kind of charisma very few people have and that unique voice you cant really compare him to anybody
3017797 we didnt want to be just another faceless rock band playing depressing i hate my dad music
3017798 we wanted to go out there and kick ass like they did in the 80s
3017799 thats what rock is supposed to be about rebellion and having fun weve been blessed with the opportunity to play music as a career so we might as well take advantage of it and have a good time
3017800 story centers on veronica jonkers the young woman from valley song who left her grandfathers farm to pursue a singing career in cape town in home she returns after her grandfathers death to create a new life for her young son
3017801 eh zy omg should i go to the toilet the concert is about to start
3017802 plans to release a novel about prophet muhammads child bride aisha have been scrapped by us publishers random house over fears it could spark violence
3017803 seems that there are more than a couple of folks taking notice of your postings tom excellent job i believe cleveland is better off because of the job you did
3017804 tom blumer at bizzyblog brings actual facts about coal miner fatalities to light and gives the bdsers a reality check
3017805 the best blogger in the state and a more talented natural economist than any of those pointy headed keynesian halfwits
3017806 tom blumer is doing stuff that msnbc and ap should have done before providing the teenager farris hassan a national international forum and 15 minutes of fame
3017807 guys like tom blumer cover what really matters and theyre independent enough to tell the truth without fear of aggravating corporate media owners
3017808 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff
3017809 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss
3017810 beijing is probably among the five or six most exciting cities in the world for music and its all really happened in the last few years
3017811 the idea was to stay here two years teaching and learning about china
3017812 as you can see that plan didnt quite work out
3017813 there is so much interesting exciting music being created out there that we can have lives every night except monday when we have to rest
3017814 the most exciting thing about it right now is the energy just a crazy force of energy i had forgotten that music could have that kind of raw power these are bands you can see up close and personal
3017815 the audience really wanted chinese bands to sound like foreign bands
3017816 i thought with the right kind of support and the right kind of infrastructure behind them there was a possibility within five or six years beijing could have a really exciting music scene
3017817 it was clear that beijing was going through this massive explosion bands started coming out from everywhere and we started seeing musicians of all kinds
3017818 the chinese discovered all this avant garde experimental music at the same time
3017819 its like opening a huge toy store and picking and choosing whatever music you want and mixing with it playing with it
3017820 there are things you dont do but that sort of pressure to remain below the censorship radar might actually make the scene in some ways more interesting
3017821 even a band like carsick cars their music might not necessarily be saying anything specific but it is a statement of individuality and being an artist in the new china a sense of individual identity is able to be expressed right now i think thats what a lot of the music is about
3017822 the young generation dont really care about politics anymore they care more about their own stuff
3017823 life around us we just write songs about our life the things happening around us or friends we dont really use music as a tool to tell people our political idea
3017824 we dont want to watch the audience sometimes we really enjoy what the sound we make when we perform
3017825 i dont know we liked the idea so many cars in beijing
3017826 it would have been prohibitive to have tried to film it live
3017827 we could not put the helicopter pilot at risk by making him try to follow the firework route
3017828 the city of heavenly tranquility beijing in the history of china
3017829 its been the most incredible destruction that beijing has seen since the days of ghengis khan theyve destroyed every recognizable city its unique architectural and cultural heritage theyve disrupted communities who have lived here for 500 sometimes 800 900 years
3017830 theyve created basically with the exception of a few buildings a very modern ugly characterless city that is not recognizably part of china that bears no relation to beijings history
3017831 i never thought life could be like this when i was working at a factory it was very simple in the day time i would just work eight hours and afterwards i would just go home and do housework just the factory and home
3017832 what in your opinion is the greatest lesson the chinese left the world
3017833 it has a beginning middle and end its the story of one mans struggle against eveil and the redemption of his son
3017834 this is more episodic its more like indiana jones actually you have themes and things that still throught go through it but its now what its based on this is bigger
3017835 i got to fill in a blank and go around in a universe that is not restricted and therefore not quite as dark
3017836 and we can have a lot more fun with it
3017837 i wanted to develop a character that would help anakin settle down
3017838 because at the end of episode ii he was kind of a wild child and he and obi wan dont get along so the idea was to see how they become friends how they became partners and how they become a team
3017839 this wont be a kids line it will be books that have a bit more of a humorous bent dini cartoons is sort of taking characters that are a little looser a little funnier and telling interesting stories about them
3017840 ive talked to j bone about bringing over the mutant texas stories and ive also talked to the guys about doing a humor anthology taking in some of those characters
3017841 we wondering if there is a way to broaden the audiences a little more without losing some of the edge that we cant do on saturday morning fare
3017842 so we said can we keep the fans happy with a classic character like tony stark or ultron or hulk and then give something to the kids that kind of snuck in and sat on the couch next to their parents or older siblings to watch the first four movies and make everybody happy
3017843 its always a challenge because fans want this and kids usually need this and i think in this one we kind of found this nice goonies blend of fun action family fare without losing what the fans need feel like its a marvel adventure or a marvel project
3017844 theyre not going to agree with every choice you make theres just no way for them to feel that way because they wouldnt necessarily make those kind of decisions but if they feel like theyre taking the care thats needed when you make these choices they respect that
3017845 the former head of britains mi6 sir roger dearlove confirms to suskind on the record that both bush and blair received late breaking but excellent first hand intelligence that saddam was bluffing on wmds

3017855 aamiin boleh juga idemu baiklah insya alloh segera aku tulis surat buat bu dokter itu nanti kalu kamu berobat lagi dan ketemu bu dokter itu serahkan ya tapi waktu menyerahkannya senyum lho jangan cemberut dan jangan dendam
3017856 siapa seorang hamba yang ditimpa penyakit kemudian ia bersabar dan berobat dengan cara yang benar maka penyakitnya itu akan menjadi penebus dosa dosanya yang telah lalu
3017857 demi masa sesungguhnya manusia semuanya dalam keadaan merugi kecuali mereka yang beriman dan beramal sholeh dan saling berwasiat dengan kebenaran dan saling berwasiat dengan kesabaran
3017858 bu maaf ini amplop untuk bu dokter semoga bermanfaat maaf ya bu jika kami selalu sakit dan terima kasih ya bu atas perawatan ibu selama ini kepada kami
3017859 do ya sell them new horseless carriage i heard about in the news reels
3017860 yeah just look around you 99 percent of the people here are total hipsters
3017861 these hipster zombies are the idols of the style pages the darlings of viral marketers and the marks of predatory real estate agents
3017862 and they must be buried for cool to be reborn
3017863 yeah i dont know you shouldnt use that word its just
3017864 no its just well if you dont know why then you just shouldnt even use it
3017865 ok so what are you girls doing tonight after this party
3017866 im dubious of these hypotheses because they always smell of an agenda
3017867 youre not some club kid in new york in the nineties this shit is so hipster
3017868 if you dont give a damn we dont give a fuck
3017869 if only we carried rocks instead of cameras wed look like revolutionaries

3017873 it was unbelievable jason lezak finished the race better than we could have asked for in the last 50 meters i was like this is going to be a really close race at the end as you could see i was pretty excited i was very emotional
3017874 your worse enemy can be your best friend and your best friend your worse enemy
3017875 oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
3017876 there will be signs in the sun moon and stars on the earth nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea men will faint from terror apprehensive of what is coming on the world for the heavenly bodies will be shaken at that time they will see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory when these things begin to take place stand up and lift up your heads because your redemption is drawing near
3017877 look at the fig tree and all the trees when they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near even so when you see these things happening you know that the kingdom of god is near
3017878 i tell you the truth this generation b will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened
3017879 be careful or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation drunkenness and the anxieties of life and that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap for it will come upon all those who live on the face of the whole earth be always on the watch and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen and that you may be able to stand before the son of man
3017880 his buddy got the jumper cables and hooked him up to a giant battery for his semi then fired up the engine he probably had to put down his beer first to put the clamps on each side of the snake bite
3017881 the guy is screaming yelling and seizing from this treatment they thought it would somehow break the venom down
3017882 someone actually did a study and found that electric therapy doesnt work its just an interesting laymans myth this guy ended up with third degree electrical burns
3017883 now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble
3017884 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
3017885 depart from me yea that work iniquity i never knew you

3017889 shia labeouf is in danger of having his left pinky finger amputated according to an explosive new scoop from
3017890 weve worked long and hard on this deal and im delighted hes signed
3017891 all along i felt the player would like to come and play for albion i genuinely hope hes excited about coming here and playing in a team he thinks he can help
3017892 hes got to be part of the jigsaw puzzle were trying to put together and im looking forward to working with him
3017893 he brings power pace size and the experience of playing regularly in the premier league and playing in a side that did reasonably well in the premier league
3017894 we have to make sure we go for it again and im desperate to be part of it i feel as though im starting off again really but ive always said the most important thing is that the club gains success and wins trophies
3017895 manchester united need to win euopean cups its a great challenge every year at united but a greater challenege than ever this time as we try to repeat the success of last season as a team
3017896 for me personally its a great challenge to try and break into a team thats just won the double
3017897 last season i would say he was probably in our top two or three most consistent players he was fantastic throughout the season and deserved all the success he got including a place with england
3017898 ive got a number of challenges ahead of me and the ultimate one is to try and get back in that team in front of wes thats going to be hard for me with the way wes performed last season even though he is younger than me hes a great example of how you recover from an injury and how you come back
3017899 the strength of the squad now is enormous and with the youth in the squad and the ability i do feel we are in a better position but we have to show that important mentality and character to show we can go and do it again
3017900 no manchester united has ever been able to go on and repeat that success year in year out weve waited nine years from 1999 we cant afford to wait that long again weve got to go and prove ourselves
3017901 weve always talked about being a great club but bayern munich ajax and real madrid have all gone on to repeat their success and thats what manchester united have to do
3017902 ive believe as a fan as im sure all fans do that manchester united should be in that category
3017903 as older players now weve been through that and we can see that those youngter players are delivering the spirit in the dressing room that wins your european cups and championships
3017904 a team doesnt win the european cup based purely on ability they win it because they have a desire and a spirit with them we could see that last season i sat and watched it for 12 months to see them come into carrington every morning i could see those players taking over the dressing room
3017905 myself giggsy and scholesy offer experience where we can at times but we watch the other lands having the times of their lives
3017906 ive got to go and do the very best i can at manchester united because thats the only place where i really want to play football
3017907 the son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men 23 and they will kill him and he will be raised on the third day
3017908 what do you think simon from whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute from their sons or from others
3017909 then the sons are free 27 however not to give offense to them go to the sea and cast a hook and take the first fish that comes up and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel take that and give to them for me and for yourself
3017910 we do expect a lively turnout there a strong turnout
3017911 i do think that public financing levels the playing field and also encourages more people to compete
3017912 thats a good measure of progress and i think part of it is due to public financing because more people are willing to come forward and run
3017913 pod a dar un paso a peor y atacarles a ellos
3017914 la mitad de la poblaci n de getxo fue agredida sin que la polic a de balza la que escolta a de juana la que permiti la manifestaci n de donostia san sebasti n hiciera nada
3017915 o p blico das olimp adas deve se lembrar de n o abrir e mails ou clicar em links desconhecidos n o importa quantas medalhas de ouro forem oferecidas
3017916 our clients tell us they want to be in asia property and we go where our clients want to go
3017917 regardless of the downturn in the u s and europe there is a strong domestic need particularly in india and china that continues to fuel demand for housing and retail
3017918 theres no question that its going to be a bumpy road if the united states plunges into a severe recession but whereas before there was very little domestic demand in china and india a lot of that demand can now be picked up internally
3017919 the babys mother is jaymes foster aikens friend and record producer whom he met while performing on

3017954 the courts order is an illegal prior restraint on legitimate academic research
3017955 sie wissen wie hart der wettbewerb ist deshalb m ssen sie uns mit dem preis entgegenkommen
3017956 den besseren service wollte ich nicht warum soll ich ihn dann bezahlen
3017957 aber meines wissens haben unsere leute das umgehend gel st so dass sie
3017958 ich entnehme ihren ausf hrungen dass sie mit unserer zusammenarbeit zufrieden ist
3017959 dann wollen sie sicher auch k nftig mit uns zusammenarbeiten
3017960 deshalb m ssen wir unsere preise um 4 73 prozent erh hen
3017961 das haben wir uns gedacht deshalb haben wir nochmals mit unseren zulieferern verhandelt au erdem haben wir die abl ufe xy optimiert dadurch konnten wir unsere kosten um fast zwei prozent senken weshalb wir unsere preise letztlich nur um 2 87 prozent erh hen m ssen
3017962 unser bauteil hat bei ihren st ckkosten nur einen anteil von vier prozent
3017963 wenn wir also 3 500 euro kompensieren dann w rden sie mir den auftrag erteilen
3017964 any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
3017965 that didnt provide us with the opportunity to test the security arrangements we will explore whether we would only use karachi and lahore
3017966 we want to see whether that would enhance the security situation for us at those two venues and it may be decided that we would not use pindi at all it is not finalised but it is a strong possibility
3017967 i just dont understand why the police took my sons life
3017968 he was shy he wasnt the type of guy who would antagonize a police officer
3017969 he didnt like clubbing or drinking beer he was a quiet guy he liked to stay in
3017970 why why did the police officer need to kill him
3017971 i cant tell you what they were doing we dont even know how many teenagers there were
3017972 he was standing up and then the police pushed him to the ground because he was too aggressive he was trying to fight them
3017973 we were six guys and two girls we approached but we didnt touch them
3017974 the police officer took out her gun without thinking it just happened too fast
3017975 at one point the group began to move and a good number of individuals charged toward the police and threatened them
3017976 one of the police officers present then fired in the direction of the suspects striking three of them
3017977 a friend of fredys called his aunt and then she called here thats how we found out
3017978 these were peaceful guys who always hung out around here

3017980 i know there are gangs here and there are drugs going on but they were only playing marbles so its really not fair what they did he didnt sell drugs he didnt smoke he didnt drink he was really smart its heartbreaking
3017981 were going to sue this cant continue to happen fredy died for no reason
3017982 we want to know whether this is standard police technique
3017983 when kids see that theyre going to hate police im going to tell my kids if you see a police car go away i dont trust them
3017984 we have a sister who is disabled so he spent a lot of time at home taking care of her

3017993 the sycuan gave 45 000 to the campaign for a november redistricting initiative promoted by schwarzenegger
3017994 now at the request of sycuans neighbors and a gambling watchdog
3017995 federal attorneys are taking a hard look at whether the interior department could legally approve a gambling agreement that had not yet been executed by the tribe
3017996 if they conclude the answer is no the federal governments approval could be revoked and sycuan could be forced to resubmit the deal to the interior department if and when it is ratified by the tribe that would give federal officials who were troubled by the agreements authorization of an off reservation casino in dehesa valley their first real opportunity to review the compact
3017997 has belonged entirely to the alternative and new media the tabloid national enquirer has done all the significant reporting on it reporting that turns out to be largely correct and bloggers and online commentators have refused to let the story sputter into oblivion

3018009 the book has sold nicely and i was able to buy a much bigger place to live i only had a small flat before
3018010 i wanted to be able to give a room to as many friends who live in care homes as possible

3018022 i love nothing better than fastening my pinny round my waist and baking a cake for kevin in my 1950s kitchen
3018023 i put on some lovely frank sinatra music and am completely lost in my own little fantasy world in our marriage i am very much a lady and kevin is the breadwinner and my protector
3018024 i dont even put petrol in our ford anglia car which is 43 years old because i think that is so unladylike i ask kevin to do it
3018025 the key factor in selecting open texts solutions was ease of integration with our existing sap solutions based environment
3018026 no other solution providers were better positioned than the open text and sap teams to support citrix systems with our ap project they brought the right combination of technology and expertise
3018027 ap is about getting the bills paid yet generating invoices and collecting payments has traditionally been a labor intensive process paper invoices and related documents result in money and time wasted on filing retrieving copying mailing or searching for misplaced misfiled paper
3018028 without an effective process solution it is virtually impossible to generate metrics that reduce costs and improve compliance our ap solutions offer powerful capabilities that streamline and automate the invoice handling process and thus eliminate issues that drive up costs linked to each ap transaction

3018038 we appeal to anyone who may have seen or heard anything relating to the incident to contact the police
3018039 we are looking for anyone who was in the area of albion place park between 12 30am and 3am who might have information relating to how sam may have sustained his injuries or who saw anyone running away from there

3018043 no one can play the role of bobby like dimple kapadia did she is still so beautiful and i would love to woo her on screen again if a remake is made
3018044 i play a next door boy and the film is about his love life at different phases of life
3018045 in both saawariya and bachna ae haseeno i play a lover boy but wont keep myself confined to that particular image give me two years and you will find me beating up goons and kicking in the air
3018046 my first film saawariya was not a commercially hit one though it was the best possible launch that one can ever have but this time i expect my film to be a commercially hit one
3018047 both of us have just started our career we would appreciate if people talk about the film and our characters instead of linking our personal life with the romance on screen
3018048 right from amitabh bachchan to darsheel safary bollywood has never been so competitive every day a new actor takes the reign as a result we actors have to constantly groom ourselves

3018073 i know nothing about the video and have only seen the photos yes it looks like its really her but it is ridiculous to think it was me who put them there
3018074 when they start to change their behaviors and really focus only on that number on the scale only on their weight thats when it gets dangerous everything you do during pregnancy including your diet and exercise should be for your health not for your weight
3018075 calorie restriction is linked with growth retardation and birth defects and with vitamin deficiencies both for the mother and baby whats interesting about vitamin deficiencies is say for instance with calcium deficiency the baby will probably get what he or she needs but thatll be at the expense of the mothers bones so you really have to be careful with that
3018076 from the mothers mental and physical health to better deliveries better postpartum recoveries even a higher i q for the baby
3018077 but you dont want to overdo it you never want to exercise to the point where youre not getting enough oxygen because thats linked with neurological defects in the baby
3018078 you shouldnt exercise to the point of exhaustion if you need to throw yourself on the couch afterwards just to rejuvenate youve done too much you should feel invigorated after your workout not exhausted
3018079 i think weve never before been more kind of obsessed with celebrity culture and with celebrity pregnancies as well its not unusual to see pictures of these celebrities the day before and the day after birth and theyre looking super humanly fit theyre really incredible
3018080 but you also have to remember a lot of these celebrities are just genetically blessed they have the best dieticians nutritionists trainers etc they certainly have an advantage
3018081 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3018082 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3018083 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3018084 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3018085 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3018086 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3018087 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3018088 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3018089 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3018090 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3018091 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things

3018100 effort is being made to involve all other apsta members at the meeting particularly the apsta secretariat in south africa
3018101 i state very categorically that president mbeki in no way benefited from the arms deal
3018102 astounded at the ease with which she elects to question the integrity of the president
3018103 there is as yet no group of people more open to foreigners and to the concept of new ideas human progress and mutual co habitation than the people of the region
3018104 stimulated all the regions geo political zones of nigeria to exert themselves exploit their resources and fully express their unique endowments
3018105 my contention is that it is a national problem that festered because of absence of justice accountability respect and a sense of reciprocal partnership
3018106 with the growing awareness and increasing availability and access to information by the youths of the niger delta only a timely adjustment of the outdated and repugnant military legislations can guarantee the unity of the country
3018107 very importantly the issue of gas flaring must be frontally confronted now to stop the continuous wasting of the ever depleting non renewable gas assets of the niger delta region the volume of gas flared annually as we now know can sufficiently generate enough energy to power the entire country and even beyond
3018108 i wish to say that the solution to the seeming stubborn south south question is not an abstract one it is real and it is within achievable distance it only demands political will a genuine return to the basic principle of justice equity and respect
3018109 nothing can be farther from the truth as history shows there is as yet no group of people more open to foreigners and to the concept of new ideas human progress and mutual co habitation than the people of the region
3018110 absence of justice accountability respect and a sense of reciprocal partnership
3018111 under the act ownership and control of all lands in nigeria are vested in the governor of each state who is clothed with power to issue and revoke rights of occupancy over land overnight all previous land owners became mere occupiers tenants leasees of their own lands this is the origin of the argument that the oil and gas resources found in the niger delta belong to nigeria and not the people of the region under the previous arrangement oil and gas companies usually paid compensation to land owners for the exploration and exploitation activities carried out thereon
3018112 is an offensive law that has been widely thumbed down
3018113 one main snag is that in operation this act became a ploy by the federal government to get round the common law principle that vests ownership of whatever attaches to land on the land owner
3018114 further more the land use act speedily migrated from being an ordinary act of the national assembly to become a part of the constitution by section 315 5 d of the 1999 constitution the provisions of the land use act shall continue to apply and have full effects in accordance with the tenor and to the extent as any other provisions forming part of the constitution and shall not be altered or repealed except in accordance with the provisions of section 9 2 of the constitution it has been observed that the implication of the provision is that the principles of landholding in nigeria are constitutionally fixed and frozen
3018115 notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section the entire property in and control of minerals mineral oils and natural gas in under or upon any land in nigeria or in under or upon the territorial waters and the exclusive economic zone of nigeria shall vest in the government of the federation and shall be managed in such manner as may be prescribed by the national assembly
3018116 thus under this legal cloak the economic rights of our people for ample compensation from resources taken from the land were circumscribed since these actions were taken it has been difficult for the people to accept that these actions were not deliberately designed to exclude them from full enjoyment of life which ironically the constitution purports to promote
3018117 allows us the opportunity to secure our future in an increasingly difficult industrial and economic environment
3018118 there are those who would suggest that we would be better served by simply rejecting this agreement that all we have to do is simply go back and get more
3018119 or they argue the agreement favors the northwest pilots over the delta pilots in one respect or another but upon closer analysis these views are many times based on a misunderstanding of the agreement a misinterpretation of its terms a failure to acknowledge todays economic realities or simply anger
3018120 as i have written many times before anger is not a strategy
3018121 theres a relationship between what the prosecution spends and what the defense needs
3018122 prosecutors could have proceeded with one or two counts ten witnesses could prove that case
3018123 i was doing my job and i would do the same things again
3018124 and it makes it harder for the imeems of the world to maintain their rates
3018125 myspace is limited to people who use myspace whereas these widgets can be used on any platform so they have access to a broader audience we are also starting to see ads within those widgets
3018126 i definitely think myspace has been paying attention to what they are doing
3018127 our original investment is worth a great deal more than what we paid for our original investment
3018128 rita arndt molis has excelled in every endeavor she has engaged and her energy creativity intellect and enthusiasm will lead miamis program toward our collective vision of excellence
3018129 in rita we not only have a head coach but a teacher communicator competitor educator colleague and representative of this extraordinary university we are extremely fortunate to have someone of ritas talents join the miami family
3018130 rita is an outstanding leader and role model for student athletes and she brings high energy to work every day
3018131 her contributions to our student athletes and their quest for excellence have been significant i am grateful for her guidance to our student athletes and their championship success in competition the classroom and as members of our society
3018132 as you float around the country and compete against national caliber teams you learn what the championship programs look like how they act how they carry themselves how they handle adversity and what their culture is creating that championship culture at miami is my primary objective a place where athletes trust themselves are committed to the process and have a sense of personal responsibility i envision a redhawk tradition where everyone involved with the program from student athletes to administration is working toward championships and is unapologetic and relentless in that pursuit
3018133 from my time at south florida and at michigan state ive been fortunate to work with competitive cross country and track and field programs that won conference titles and began to earn national recognition and im looking to bring that experience with me to miami
3018134 i feel lucky to have been associated with the entire michigan state athletic department

3018146 the take home message here is its a big deal
3018147 its probably the biggest impact in the shortest time that i can think of
3018148 if i can use some of that heat energy and convert it to electricity you can improve the overall efficiency
3018149 there are several other steps that are required to commercialize the material but were cautiously optimistic that these steps can be carried out successfully
3018150 we think we can make people feel cooler more quickly feel comfortable more quickly and that will translate into less power in the central ac system
3018151 r us inc say they will stop selling baby bottles made with the chemical next year and the maker of the hard plastic nalgene water bottles announced in april that it would stop using the chemical
3018152 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3018153 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3018154 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california

3018158 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3018159 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3018160 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3018161 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3018162 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3018163 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3018164 however does one really blow his leg out what is that like holding your nose and blowing out to pop your ears
3018165 jeez dork you look like youre trying to play the tuba

3018209 the jail in this county is not punishment but it sure is not a free ride
3018210 people should not become ill because they are served bad food in jail
3018211 they should not contract diseases because they are placed in a cell with an infected inmate they should not be denied needed medications
3018212 a lot of people say those who go into the mental health field are crazy themselves
3018213 youre dealing with people who are going through a life changing or major event in their lives
3018214 my role demands the integrity to say i cant do that or i cant say that no matter how strongly you feel you have to remain independent i have to be able to look in the mirror and know that my opinion would be the same no matter what side hired me
3018215 for police officers learning how to become investigators forensic psychologists can help give them another avenue of questioning through interviewing techniques and personality traits so things arent just black and white

3018332 die dauernde konfrontation mit dem gerede um liebe die berflutung mit erotischen und sexuellen reizen und das perpetuale fortw hrende anm d red vorgehalten bekommen wie toll das alles sein soll gibt mir ein immer st rkeres gef hl nicht zu euch anderen zu geh ren pervers oder geisteskrank zu sein
3018333 es ist dennoch gut zu wissen dass die schwierigkeiten offenbar doch nicht ganz so speziell sind ich entdecke viele hnliche z ge bei einigen von euch
3018334 ja auch ich geh re zu den sogenannten abs ich bin 26 m nnlich habe durchaus viele frauen in meinem freundes und bekanntenkreis und trotzdem bin ich jungfrau bei mir pers nlich ist es das problem dass ich mir st ndig viel zu viele gedanken dar ber mache wie ich auf andere wirke das blockiert mich f hrt zu selbstzweifeln und vor allem ist es ein teufelskreis
3018335 klingt sinnvoll ist es aber nicht denn selbst wenn versagens ngste eine rolle spielen was definitiv nur bei einem bruchteil der jungfrauen der fall ist ist es doch nunmal so wie minderwertig muss ich mich als ab wohl f hlen wenn die einzige m glichkeit sexuelle erfahrungen zu sammeln darin besteht f r sex zu bezahlen
3018336 ich denke nicht dass das problem der abs ist noch nie mit jemandem sex gehabt zu haben sondern dass sie berhaupt noch nie die erfahrung gemacht haben wie es ist geliebt zu werden denn wenn man das erst einmal sp rt dann wird sex ganz schnell zur nebensache wenn auch zu der vielleicht sch nsten auf der welt
3018337 ich bin 23 und habe seit einem halben jahr meine erste freundin und hatte vor drei monaten auch erst zum 1
3018338 man ist zwar oft abgelenkt durch beruf und andere dinge aber in manchen momenten macht einen die liebesbezogen einsamkeit einfach fast kaputt was nat rlich dann zum problem werden kann ist dass man dieses gef hl auch bekommt wenn man auf eine frau zugehen will
3018339 sich hier hinzsutellen und zu sagen die stellen sich dann einfach nur doof an ist ja wohl sehr beschr nkt ich kenne mehrere leute einschlie lich mir selbst die ihren ersten partner erst weit nach ihrem 20 geburtstag hatten und als ob die einsamkeit die man schon selbst in sich sp rt nicht schon schlimm genug ist kommen dann so fr hpubert re besserwisser und behaupten man solle hal tmal von der glotze weg also wenn beziehungen so einfach w ren
3018340 ich wei nicht aber ich denke irgendwann kommt man aus bestimmten verhaltensmustern nicht mehr raus und dann hilft es vielleicht sich professionelle hilfe zu suchen wenn man so sehr darunter leidet daf r braucht man sich nicht sch men oder minderwertig zu f hlen
3018341 ich wei aus eigener erfahrung dass eine gute psychotherapie hilft bin zwar mit 26 immer noch ab aber mein welt und selbstbild hat sich durch eine therapie absolut grundlegend ver ndert und zwar sehr zum positiven auch m nnerm ig bin ich auf dem richtigen weg ich finde auch absolut nix dabei eine therapie zu machen das hei t nicht dass man einen an der waffel hat sondern dass man seine probleme erkennt und aktiv angeht zum arzt geht man auch nicht erst mit einer lungenentz ndung sondern schon mit einer grippe

3018377 i ask people do you want to prosper what do you have you may not have money but you have time not just time but time to learn so use that join an insurance company and be an agent or join a company and sell their product the important thing is to learn and from there branch out dont get a job to earn money get a job to learn and dont start a business to earn money get into a business to learn the money will follow
3018378 some people start a business and want to earn right away but thats not wise starting a business is like a slingshot you have to pull back that means clearing the way take time pulling back because when its time to release youll be surprised that your business will rapidly shoot towards the target

3018430 i am shell shocked to be honest three in a row is a real achievement and i just need to keep reeling them off now
3018431 i was feeling confident after warm up and i knew we would have a good set up for the race i had a great dice with michael when i got ahead of him he came back aggressively but i took him and just got my head down i had a couple of moments with the back markers and i dropped a bit of time but it was all ok in the end and i am over the moon
3018432 when i post new things will my friends actually see them
3018433 have my friends posted something that im not seeing the news feed is cluttered right now with people i dont care about
3018434 theres no doubt that the stability and calm has created a good atmosphere that has allowed us to make more summer camps and oversee the youths
3018435 the ten most important things you can say to a catholic
3018436 whatever enables us to go to war secures our peace
3018437 i think it just goes to show just how bearish the market has turned
3018438 its like it was when prices went up it didnt seem to matter what bearish news came out the price just kept going up
3018439 buyer agent can say well we did have a home inspection
3018440 if the buyer does not think he can sell him own home why would i take the chance for him
3018441 supondr que o bien se env an a otra parte o se construye otro almac n centro del recinto cerrado cosa poco probable
3018442 algo improbable dados los niveles de conocimientos cient ficos actuales
3018443 este dato es uno m s a a adir al c mulo de desprop sitos y de incidentes que est provocando la central nuclear y que por m s que se insista por parte de los responsables de la central sobre su rentabilidad y sobre la necesidad de disponer de este sistema de producci n de energ a las alternativas ser n siempre a medio y largo plazo mucho m s rentables eficientes y seguras que la central nuclear
3018444 incluso con iberdrola a la cabeza un territorio con producci n de energ a verde
3018445 parte por su oposici n al plan hidrol gico del pp
3018446 el gobierno socialista subi al poder aupado entre otras cosas por la oposici n al plan hidrol gico nacional del pp fruto de esa presi n tuvo que derogar el trasvase del ebro sin embargo en esta segunda legislatura la pol tica desarrollista e insostenible del gobierno empieza a coquetear de nuevo con trasvases entre cuencas este es el caso del posible trasvase valdeca as murcia a trav s del trasvase tajo segura
3018447 la propuesta parece consistir en derivar entre 500 y 600 hect metros c bicos anuales desde el pantano de valdeca as de c ceres alimentado por el r o tajo hasta la roda donde conectar a con el acueducto tajo segura que abastece a murcia alicante y almer a se busca aumentar el caudal del acueducto tajo segura con agua que no proceda de la cabecera sino del curso medio es posible que este acueducto fuera aprobado en esta legislatura aunque todav a est en fase de tanteo
3018448 la realizaci n de este trasvase pondr a en riesgo el abastecimiento a las poblaciones alimentadas por el tajo segura ya que el agua de valdeca as es de poca calidad al incluir las aguas residuales de madrid
3018449 es decir que estamos hablando de una propuesta que significar a trasvasar toda la cantidad actualmente disponible en el embalse durante un a o
3018450 una vez m s el agua trasvasada no es para agua de boca de la poblaci n garantizada sobradamente por las cuencas locales sino para los proyectos de extensi n urban stica asociados en muchos casos a campos de golf y sobre todo para la expansi n de la agricultura industrial fuertemente insostenible en la zona

3018454 although oil prices have been increasing they asian emerging markets have seen an increasing offset in terms of rising exports to the oil exporters

3018459 a nadie se le escapa que hasta la pr xima temporada el hotel seguir cerrado
3018460 no s lo falta de previsi n porque un verano m s el hotel de tabarca va a permanecer cerrado sino adem s el desinter s y la poca sensibilidad con una isla que lleva a os infravalorada por el pp

3018469 m s de un a o despu s la conselleria ha solicitado al consistorio una pr rroga ya que las obras no se han iniciado
3018470 ste es uno de esos casos en los que se enga a a los ciudadanos haci ndoles creer en unas mejoras de un edificio sanitario con la simple colocaci n de una valla cuando detr s no hay ni proyectos ni la inversi n necesaria
3018471 parece que la crisis a la que ha llevado el gobierno aut nomo del pp a la comunitat y la absoluta quiebra econ mica de la instituci n va a repercutir en el gasto social y en el recorte de las inversiones p blicas en servicios necesarios para el conjunto de los ciudadanos como en este caso la sanidad

3018536 parts of the eastern interconnection power grid are failing this morning servers for several news organizations appear to have been abruptly knocked off line rail port and air traffic control network computer systems are experiencing glitches numerous banks have temporarily suspended their electronic operations reports are coming in that the pentagon may have suffered a large cyberattack some systems have been compromised others are shut down to contain security breaches

3018538 america is the greatest superpower this world has ever known but we have a very vulnerable point in our military our own achilles heel exploiting this vulnerable point may trigger the greatest shock in the history of warfare computer dependence is the western worlds within a few years this weakness could be tested to the full
3018539 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying also thou son of man thus saith the lord god unto the land of israel an end the end is come upon the four corners of the land they have blown the trumpet even to make all ready but none goeth to the battle for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof
3018540 it is unfair especially after seven years of mr bushs inept leadership but any democrat will face tougher questioning about his or her fitness to be commander in chief mrs clinton has more than cleared that bar using her years in the senate well to immerse herself in national security issues and has won the respect of world leaders and many in the american military she would be a strong commander in chief
3018541 the choice then comes down to preparedness who is best prepared to confront the enormous challenges the nation faces from ending the iraq war to shoring up americas middle class to confronting global climate change the job requires a president who not only understands the changes needed to move the country forward but also possesses the discipline and skill to navigate the reality of the resistant washington power structure to get things done that candidate is new york sen hillary rodham clinton
3018542 we have strong disagreements with all the republicans running for president the leading candidates have no plan for getting american troops out of iraq they are too wedded to discredited economic theories and unwilling even now to break with the legacy of president bush we disagree with them strongly on what makes a good supreme court justice
3018543 we have shuddered at mr mccains occasional tactical pander to the right because he has demonstrated that he has the character to stand on principle
3018544 the real mr giuliani whom many new yorkers came to know and mistrust is a narrow obsessively secretive vindictive man who saw no need to limit police power racial polarization was as much a legacy of his tenure as the rebirth of times square mr giulianis arrogance and bad judgment are breathtaking when he claims fiscal prudence we remember how he ran through surpluses without a thought to the inevitable downturn and bequeathed huge deficits to his successor he fired police commissioner william bratton the architect of the drop in crime because he couldnt share the limelight he later gave the job to bernard kerik who has now been indicted on fraud and corruption charges the rudolph giuliani of 2008 first shamelessly turned the horror of 9 11 into a lucrative business with a secret client list then exploited his citys and the countrys nightmare to promote his presidential campaign

3018554 ive missed two of the three games with richmond senior since andrew has been on the varsity he said

3018557 xavier nixon loves grapes he said of britts standout offensive lineman
3018558 i aspire to be as strong as him and tough in all areas of life he said
3018559 i knew it drove him crazy to be as uninvolved as he was just going to the games i was happy for him that hes found a way to get a little more satisfaction feeling a part of the team
3018560 he could play linebacker for us but hes sacrificed for the team to play offensive line bailey said
3018561 hes a little undersized to be a lineman 6 1 220 but hes tough as nails
3018562 hes gotten them from all the ivy league schools bailey said
3018563 i dont know what level of football he can play but he would be a valuable member of any team because hes that kind of kid
3018564 its important for our family as much as it is for the team andrew said
3018565 its a last chance to get a ring im just ready to get going
3018566 im just a dad whos kind of sick whos looking forward to watching his son play he said
3018567 what were doing is saving infants who probably would have been stillborn before
3018568 now were saving them at earlier and earlier gestational ages providing intensive care and some of them make it and some of them dont
3018569 over time the american diet lifestyle health behavioral risks all of those things add up and erode that advantage they started with
3018570 there must be pockets of residents that have some kind of a characteristic that is contributing to a higher infant mortality whether thats substance abuse or something else
3018571 i just cant tell you because we havent done that specific of an analysis
3018572 see if there is anything that might suggest an environmental exposure
3018573 the parents knew this was going to happen but said we want to get to know her before she goes
3018574 standing on the sidelines you just go i dont know if i would have the same toughness
3018575 even though many clinic patients dont have insurance we have pulled together community partnerships to make sure they get everything insured women would get
3018576 it seems like an infant loss isnt as tragic to the general population as an older child or a teenager people dont understand why youre grieving because you didnt know the baby anyway you havent been able to make memories with them

3018621 no state has a right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state the obligation to protect people lies with the state in which those individuals are located
3018622 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and that is why it is so important that this doctrine is emphatically dismissed
3018623 the russian side did not receive any official proposals from the georgian side to begin a peace process and to stop the bloodshed

3019005 this bill has been dubbed the hannah montana bill because the issue really came to light after thousands of young fans and their families in minnesota couldnt purchase tickets to the young teens concert because tickets had been bought up by professional ticket brokers and were being sold at inflated prices sometimes 2 to 5 times the face value
3019006 professional ticket brokers used special computer software to cut to the front of the line and snatch up most of the tickets beating out the average fans who simply wanted to enjoy the concert thats not fair thats cheating and this bill will make that illegal
3019007 kinder die linksh nder sind und zuvor rechts gespielt habe f hlen sich mit der linksh nder tastatur und den neuen noten wie befreit

3019022 most regions have seen strong growth for the first six months of 2008 which is a great result for the industry given the current economic uncertainties facing the global economy
3019023 the strength of some currencies against the us dollar notably the euro is presenting a challenge for the hotel industry particularly in europe which is likely to see a downturn in visitor numbers from the us and uk during the remainder of the year the us will continue to benefit from an influx in both european and asian travellers but the positive impact of inbound visitors is unlikely to offset the downward pressure as a result of the weakening economy the middle east looks set for a fifth consecutive year of double digit growth and asia is also well placed to have another strong year

3019037 former deputy secretary of state richard armitage disclosed the identity of a c i a agent to him in june 2003 but that lewis libby jr said nothing about the agent when mr woodward talked to him two weeks later
3019038 as everyone and their kitchen cat now knows former assistant secretary of state richard armitage was robert novaks apparently unwitting source for the rather uninteresting information that former ambassador joe wilsons wife was a low level cia employee and that special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald knew this perfectly well for the last three years while he pursued other administration officials who did not know that mr armitage was the original leaker
3019039 the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
3019040 the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart
3019041 that which may be known of god is manifest in them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse
3019042 i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvellous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well
3019043 simply because this work was all done by our ancestors so that it could be willed to us as a heirloom
3019044 this is the 1 400 year old mindset of islam drilled into muslims from infancy on
3019045 but to transform islam is to transform its view of muhammad its quran its theology hence its concept of the enemy
3019046 in the midst of a conflict between those for whom the category of the enemy is essential to their way of organizing all human experience and those who have banished even the idea of the enemy
3019047 they hope that by pretending that the enemy is simply misguided or misunderstood he will cease to be an enemy this is an illusion to see the enemy as someone who is merely an awkward negotiator is perverse it shows contempt for the depth and sincerity of his convictions a terrible mistake when you are dealing with a master of dissimulation who wants you dead
3019048 only those who have mastered ruthlessness can defend their society from the ruthlessness of others
3019049 ruthlessness will determine the outcome of world war iii just as it determined the outcome of world war ii when dresden was napalmed and hiroshima was incinerated
3019050 designed for men and women who know no enemy and who do not take precautions against him
3019051 are appropriate for a world in which everyone plays by the same rules and accepts the same standards of rational cooperation they are fatally unrealistic in a world in which the enemy acknowledges no rule accept that of ruthlessness
3019052 indeed it did not even claim to have made the attack in first place

3019055 the house doesnt hold you in where the porch ends there is grass there is no step up at all
3019056 the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned
3019057 that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse
3019058 forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word it seemed good to me also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent theophilus that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou hast been instructed

3019060 there are many valid reasons why women who have had abortions at the fredericton clinic would not or could not bring this challenge
3019061 dr morgentaler is therefore a suitable alternative person to do so
3019062 i really wish they would just let the process go through well win the whole thing is very unconstitutional theyre violating the canada health act and women dont have equal access to abortion in this province they do not
3019063 i think it is most unlikely the people of new brunswick will ever pay morgentaler to kill our provinces unborn babies on demand
3019064 our province needs to stand firm in this matter and i am very hopeful it will do so
3019065 the fact that jack davis is bankrolling his campaign with money he made from exxon shows how out of touch he is with everyday western new yorkers
3019066 mr powers deliberately exaggerates mr davis oil holdings conceals his own and also fails to disclose that he has accepted campaign contributions from oil and energy lobbyists
3019067 to attack davis oil returns is simply childish and flies in the face of reality
3019068 but i truly dont think its the same thing the scale of profit is so so drastically different for them to nitpick this one little thing its silly

3019071 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
3019072 tough practical and humane immigration reform in the first year of the next administration
3019073 it isnt just that the alarmists are trumpeting model results that we know must be wrong it is that they are trumpeting catastrophes that couldnt happen even if the models were right as justifying costly policies to try to prevent global warming
3019074 we have to get rid of the medieval warm period
3019075 if back in the mid 1990s we knew what we know today about climate kyoto would almost certainly not exist because we would have concluded it was not necessary
3019076 climate change is real is a meaningless phrase used repeatedly by activists to convince the public that a climate catastrophe is looming and humanity is the cause
3019077 the effects of aerosols and their uncertainties are such as to nullify completely the reliability of any of the climate models
3019078 what if you are wrong to doubt the dire global warming predictions will you be able to live with yourself for opposing the kyoto protocol
3019079 what if they are correct about man made catastrophic global warming
3019080 there are ominous signs that the earths weather patterns have begun to change dramatically and that these changes may portend a drastic decline in food production with serious political implications for just about every nation on earth
3019081 as they review the bizarre and unpredictable weather pattern of the past several years a growing number of scientists are beginning to suspect that many seemingly contradictory meteorological fluctuations are actually part of a global climatic upheaval
3019082 those who claim that winters were harder when they were boys are quite right weathermen have no doubt that the world at least for the time being is growing warmer
3019083 human race will have to fight for its existence against cold
3019084 america in longest warm spell since 1776 temperature line records a 25 year rise
3019085 the facts of the present climate change are such that the most optimistic experts would assign near certainty to major crop failure in a decade
3019086 mass deaths by starvation and probably in anarchy and violence
3019087 a general characteristic of mr gores approach is to assiduously ignore the fact that the earth and its climate are dynamic they are always changing even without any external forcing to treat all change as something to fear is bad enough to do so in order to exploit that fear is much worse
3019088 youll find more dissent at a north korean political rally than in this program
3019089 one of the polar bears looked to be dead and the other one looked to be exhausted
3019090 of the 13 populations of polar bears in canada 11 are stable or increasing in number they are not going extinct or even appear to be affected at present
3019091 each such alarmist article is larded with words such as if might could probably perhaps expected projected or modeled and many involve such deep dreaming or ignorance of scientific facts and principles that they are akin to nonsense
3019092 performing plantings is a never ending process unless the causes of plant losses are understood and addressed
3019093 considering what is known about past species changes in inwood park and other new york city parks the new york city parks department natural resources group ecological restoration efforts would benefit from structured scientific research on plantings survival through partnerships with scientists who have studied the ecology of new york city parks
3019094 todays plantings for the ecological restoration of inwood park are similar to private estate plantings done following the american revolution period which have been decimated by subsequent use and management of the land
3019095 the forest and wetland communities of inwood hill park are more diverse and have a greater structural variation than revealed by previous research
3019096 considering the results of this research on the long term ecology of the inwood park forest the natural resources group could avoid the problem observed by spanish born american poet and philosopher george santayana those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3019097 what is surprising is that such effects may pop up seventy or eighty years after birth

3019109 med den nuv rende samfunds konomiske udvikling forventes en stabil udvikling i kundernes bonitet og dermed ikke v sentlige nedskrivninger p udl n og tilgodehavender med videre i resten af 2008
3019110 resultatet for f rste halv r var ellers forbedret med 60 millioner kroner sammenlignet med januar juni 2007
3019111 vi forventede en lavere v kst i trafikken og trafikindt gterne i 2008 sammenlignet med 2007 men afmatningen er g et hurtigere end ventet p grund af den konomiske udvikling i vores omverden
3019112 n r husholdningens disponible indkomst falder er ferie og fritidsrejser blandt det f rste man holder igen p derfor er trafikken p resundsbron et af de f rste tegn p konjunkturudviklingen
3019113 det afg rende er at basisindtjeningen udvikler sig langt bedre end vi havde regnet med og vi kan lave noget der er bedre end f rste halv r 2007 det havde vi ikke regnet med
3019114 i de tider hvor alt kan ske for mig var det en overraskelse hvad der skete med roskilde bank og hvad sker der internationalt er der stadig store banker der har flere tab vi plejer at v re konservative og vi vil ikke love noget n r vi rent faktisk ikke ved hvordan markedet udvikler sig i november og december
3019115 gennem en m lrettet og langsigtet styring af pantesikkerheder har banken historisk dokumenteret at kunne genvinde eventuelle regnskabsm ssige nedskrivninger og registrerede tab i v sentligt omfang senest i forl ngelse af holms husets konkurs i december 2007 har banken og dens partnere styret et st rre antal igangv rende byggerier byggerierne har s ledes kunne afleveres uden v sentlig forsinkelse til k bere og lejere banken forventer ikke tab p dette engagement og har p nuv rende tidspunkt ikke ejendomsfinansieringer i sin portef lje som vurderes at kunne p f re banken v sentlige tab
3019116 flere af projekterne f rdigg res over de kommende 1 2 r bankens finansiering af projekter har siden primo 2007 i al v sentlighed rettet sig mod videref relse af allerede projekteret og igangsat byggeri af ejerboliger og tager sit udgangspunkt i gennemskuelige projekter der er sikret ved pant i fast ejendom
3019117 set i forhold til hvor vi ligger s ville det v re fuldst ndigt unaturligt hvis amagerbanken ikke deltog i alt det byggeri der foreg r byggeri er det grundlag vi er stiftet p og vi mener i al beskedenhed at vi har forstand p det
3019118 blandt bankens store engagementer er der ved udgangen af 1 halv r 2008 nedskrevet 21 mio kr p t engagement i lighed med ultimo 2007 banken foretager selvf lgelig s rligt n je og gennemgribende analyser s vel forud for etablering som l bende af engagementer der efter lov om finansiel virksomhed skal konsolideres og som herigennem udg r over 10 pct af bankens basiskapital

3019189 i think ive been doing it for so long they expect it now
3019190 i got started because i didnt like that with the aids disease people were politicizing a health care issue i wanted to push against that
3019191 since then ive done it because it is such a great community and a great event
3019192 i did a thousand little things it feels like everything i could think of
3019193 its all about doing something i never thought i could do
3019194 ive ridden thousands of miles in the last two years training
3019195 the four days really gave me an opportunity to get to know the people the people affected by hiv and aids
3019196 the love that people showed and expressed within those four days was really amazing the commitment as far as giving their all the sincerity and the loyalty its just so amazing
3019197 i think too many people have forgotten that aids is still with us and there are still new cases of it
3019198 people continue to need support and the public needs to be reminded
3019199 i thought it sounded interesting and i wanted to meet new people
3019200 i think the forensics one is the most popular because of the crime scenes that are on television

3019207 the law which was handed salary legislation and its implementation by the iraqi state can not freeze or suspend the law but by the house on iraq
3019208 whether theyre complaints or concerns as a professional organization you shouldnt be afraid to document your shortcomings because they are a means of improvement
3019209 are normally communicated by various means to the extent necessary to handle them we do not maintain an index or log of such things
3019210 the center board shall review quarterly a report prepared by the director regarding the centers training plan and complaints concerning the centers operation
3019211 i dont think weve been presenting it as a comprehensive look at performance that quarter
3019212 one of the reasons we want to bring in a consultant is to see how we measure up and see if were following best practices
3019213 i just didnt want the mount horeb fire department and ems to be known as a whining group
3019214 i dont know that i have ever filed a complaint against the 911 center formally the reason for that may or may not be obvious but those are people we work with on a day to day basis
3019215 can be ambivalent to the issues and say nobody has said anything so far
3019216 so we dont want to be overly zealous in pointing out mistakes that others have made
3019217 it had happened in the past and we had mentioned it
3019218 i think they had thought they had taken care of it before but it didnt take
3019219 if youre interested in improving your service you take all the complaints
3019220 normally i dont like to make waves but this sort of thing has been happening far too often lately
3019221 i guess it time to log this as an official complaint so we can begin to track the frequency of any reoccurrences
3019222 it is rare that i ever encountered a situation serious enough to warrant filing an official complaint
3019223 in a quality assurance program that doesnt just mean you rely on complaints
3019224 the patterns of complaints are analyzed to see if they suggest any improvements to policy training equipment staffing etc
3019225 in some communities external citizen oversight bodies such as auditors review complaints and investigations for sufficiency and for wider ramifications
3019226 its absolutely a critical time said don waller a uw madison professor of botany who has served in the past on the arboretum committee and stays abreast of issues
3019227 i remember thinking wow what are all these trees doing in the middle of the city meine said
3019228 this place is special because of the leopold connection and because it is the birthplace of restoration ecology
3019229 our idea in a nutshell is to reconstruct primarily for the use of the university a sample of original wisconsin a sample of what dane county looked like when our ancestors arrived here during the 1840s
3019230 our mission is to conserve and restore arboretum lands advance restoration ecology and foster the land ethic
3019231 are we a visitor center or are we a research and science facility or are we for public recreation
3019232 will be done for research rather than for amusement and for use by the university rather than for use by the town
3019233 my personal perspective is that people have been coming here for a long time and they are not going to go away
3019234 and in the tradition of the wisconsin idea it is our obligation to provide a diverse array of outreach programs from gardening classes to nature camps for kids its a way we can convey to people why we do what we do and that values of the natural world
3019235 is an admission that science does not yet know enough or is not yet sufficiently listened to to anticipate and prevent this process of wreckage which attends our supposedly advancing footsteps
3019236 the most i had ever done was a three day ride that was a focus on the family back in 2002
3019237 god gave me the desire and my family gave me the opportunity so here i am
3019238 i looked at it and thought it was awesome and would be cool to do
3019239 but i thought there was no way i would be able to get off work for that long or bike that far or raise that much money so i threw the card away
3019240 when i moved to wisconsin i was hoping to get more involved in cycling anticipating quieter roads with less traffic
3019241 little did i know that my interest would lead to a ride across the u s and canada
3019242 i figured the biking part would come so i started working on it
3019243 they said the average day was 70 miles but i figured if i could do 60 i could do 70
3019244 i had never done a hundred and this week we did three in a row so i can now say i did a century and i did three of them
3019245 raising funds and awareness for poverty is a fantastic cause and im excited at a chance to make a difference in this way
3019246 ive enjoyed the community feeling the way people help each other and the response weve gotten from so many people on the trip
3019247 they are so interested and supportive i dont know if i saw a group of people supporting something if i would just put my hand in my pocket and give money but people have been doing that along the way they are showing their interest and their support
3019248 we became aware of the trip about a year ago
3019249 they were looking for churches to be a host for a weekend and we offered to open up our facilities
3019250 it was a wonderful weekend and experience for all of us it was a privilege to host them it gave the ministries in madison an opportunity to highlight what theyre doing at the ministry fair and it was a nice break for the bike riders too
3019251 this is one of those service things that we need

3019264 it certainly indicates a trend which i think has been apparent in past elections as well particularly 06
3019265 it appears that the smart money is moving more toward democrats or at least covering both bases
3019266 it still comes down to what kind of candidates you have and how hard theyre working
3019267 the assembly is definitely in play and i think everyone understands that
3019268 im excited to see so many of our candidates with strong war chests who will be able to tell their story no matter what anybody else does
3019269 if the democrats take the assembly theyll be able to get a lot of their priorities through that they havent in the past
3019270 it will feel good its cooler than normal but you cant complain for august
3019271 but its so nice you cant really ask for anything more

3019278 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins

3019283 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
3019284 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
3019285 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
3019286 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
3019287 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands

3019298 if theres any time to have a good person in this job its now because its going to take help from the department of commerce to help some of these communities recover from these job losses
3019299 the economy is struggling right now so its a great opportunity for someone to market the state as a great place to do business and build economic development in the state
3019300 i want to get someone with a background in economic development with a background in business development and who understands the economy and will be a cheerleader for wisconsin
3019301 because you have all kinds of financial disclosures you have to make and youre coming in after a bit of a mess
3019302 theyre worried about the timing of a lag at a time when we seem to be gaining momentum and we seem to be doing a better job
3019303 its a matter of gosh were making some headway here lets not lose that over some inappropriate expenses
3019304 we have not done enough to create the kind of balanced entrepreneurial economy to offset the kind of traditional problems wisconsin has had
3019305 experience shows both in the state of wisconsin and the rest of the country that tax cuts wont buy loyalty from corporations
3019306 if its someone with economic development experience itll be a plus
3019307 if its someone straight out of the business community there will be questions and red flags about whether they can make the transition to the public sector if its a political hire it would be seen as a joke

3019363 this year on the brno circuit we will have another unknown factor as the tarmac on the circuit has been re laid so we will have to see how it affects the degradation of our tyres
3019364 over the past two years with the 250cc machine ive got two second places but with the motogp bike it is difficult to make a prediction i enjoy the track but it is not one of my favourites
3019365 we now enter the last part of the 2008 championship and visit a circuit which is very technical and which has many similarities to mugello so this is a circuit in which the talents of our rider can make a difference
3019366 made the comment that they had never been presented with such a strong panel of candidates we spent more time and energy researching candidates for this appointment than any time before
3019367 i am really excited about jamie being on the ticket
3019368 i know when we were all trying out for the position if i didnt get it i wanted jamie to get it i felt she was the most compatible conservative for the district
3019369 she brings quite a breadth of experience both having worked in the state and the federal government they cooperate more than a lot of people understand
3019370 i have been taking her around down here in washougal
3019371 the response has been really good i think that she has connected well ive heard nothing but praises even from people who are not political type people
3019372 they have been impressed with how she responded to their letters they were very impressed how responsive she was
3019373 it is a very traditional conservative district if you go back and look at how candidates have been elected versus how initiatives have fared the data paints a very strong picture and that is the heart and soul of the will of the voters jaime grew up here she spent her whole life here she knows what the voters want here
3019374 vanessa has got enough of an independent streak that appeals to the people out there
3019375 vanessas ability to be that person to attract people from both sides is really helpful to her in that race
3019376 but what ive known of her is she seems to be bright and articulate shes a great candidate and shell be a great legislator if elected
3019377 i think this is the democrats year if they do generic polls on who you are going to vote for democratss come on top if there is a year we get a d out of the 18th this will be the year to do it if there is a chance this will be the time to do it
3019378 even in a bad year like 2006 the lowest vote getter got 52 i think she represents that ideology
3019379 weve had a lot of really good candidates that we have ran in the 18th over the years but people are excited about her
3019380 she is the best candidate we have in the 18th this year i think
3019381 we are very excited about vanessas race a phenomenal person as well as a phenomenal candidate
3019382 a mother a business woman someone who truly represents that area
3019383 a person who obviously cares a lot about that community and has the opportunity to see the people on a daily basis shes not one the parties back in d c decided should be in office she is genuine and cares very much about the community she is going to be representing
3019384 vanessa has gotten kind of an early edge out there
3019385 we are expecting more fundraising so she should be just fine
3019386 i do solemnly swear that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same that i take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion and i will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which i am about to enter so help me god

3019393 lauren franges and amber rais would have been great on a break we were really hoping to get the right combo of riders but everyone was really looking at each other today we were missing a few key riders a lot of teams were a little thin today so no one really wanted to burn too many matches
3019394 with a hill like that you really have to be patient but mara attacked the hill and shes a great climber she was going hard and it put me in a bad position it forced me to jump early
3019395 i thought she was going to get me shes got such phenomenal speed but fortunately i was able to hold her off
3019396 were sort of slow but we definitely had some good attacks coming people were just trying to position themselves and figure where everyone else sat there were some really strong attacks that came on the hills and i just tried to stay with them
3019397 she was on the front a ton during the race she was really strong
3019398 she didnt have that much of a gap but it was a little bit and i thought it was now or never i jumped on my own and i just kept going i figured why not
3019399 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3019400 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3019401 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3019402 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3019403 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3019404 the impact of a bioterrorism attack would not only be life threatening to humans but also to the economy of the united states for example agriculture provides 13 1 of the united states gross domestic product and 140 billion in revenue preparedness is essential for fighting terrorism the united states department of agriculture usda has received an additional 328 million from the bush administration for homeland security protections and is requesting a 143 million increase for the year 2003 these added funds will allow for more than 7 500 food safety inspectors and 4 000 port of entry inspectors usda 2002
3019405 fine work ethic initiative and interpersonal skills that will take him far in the profession
3019406 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3019407 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3019408 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3019409 if only all of our differences could be sorted out on the sporting field

3019424 these players all bring experience to the table with their tenure at other levels
3019425 waldner is a strong steady defenseman who is known to be a mature player and who plays the game well francon is a former linemate of bill vandermeer in nainamo last season he played in columbus on their top line in the postseason after playing through injuries most of the regular season reed has a year of experience as a pro plus two extra seasons at the university level he is a versatile player who can play all three forward positions
3019426 theyre delicious sweet but fresh at the same time very well balanced
3019427 the fact that deputy tollison took his closed fist and struck the suspect in the face 13 times in my opinion was excessive
3019428 then they have the audacity to treat this man as if hes a piece of meat and taser him with electrical jolts to his body and then thats not enough

3019431 brno has always been a track where our bike has been very much at home
3019432 we have taken victory in the last two seasons but the track has been resurfaced and that creates something of an unknown for all of us
3019433 we just hope the grip is as good as it was last year and that the weather is stable over the three days so that we can prepare properly for the race
3019434 brno is a nice track but its demanding too a bit like mugello and phillip island which are two of my favourites
3019435 with the bike performing as it has been lately we should be able to fight for a good result again weve still got a few points to make up in the championship which wont be easy but well give it our best shot
3019436 im feeling pretty good now and im anxious to get back on track
3019437 ive got full movement back in the injured knee and its been fine during my training regime up to now
3019438 i dont think its going to cause me any problems on the bike but its been almost seven weeks since ive thrown a leg over it so i wont know for sure until we start free practice on friday
3019439 i know brno like the back of my hand our bridgestone tyres work well at this track and the new parts that kawasaki are bringing to the czech grand prix mean weve got some positive things to work with
3019440 the stobart team have a very good chance of scoring well in germany

3019442 im excited i know i have the best speed on asphalt
3019443 ive had some very good results in germany and this year im in the championship leading car so hopefully it can continue

3019446 ben noticed bends in the middle of two different seamount chains tracks of volcanoes on the ocean floor off of eastern australia
3019447 the chains were offset at the same time that the volcano migration slowed on land giving further evidence that the plateau arrived then and caused an abrupt westward plate excursion
3019448 we think the immense plateau which is roughly the size of greenland blocked australias northerly movement rapidly altering the pattern of volcanic activity between 26 and 23 ma
3019449 before the collision the pacific plate was sinking or subducting below the australian plate
3019450 however the arrival of the plateau jammed and reversed this system such that the australian plate now sinks below the pacific

3019526 they were deciding between me and another actress once on set i asked the directors assistant what it was that eventually got me the part she said you were both very good but it was your smile that put you over the top in the directors

3019547 one of the stories ive always wanted to play is the parent wanting to have influence over how the coach coaches and in this case wanting his son to have a chance to play before kyle chandler is ready to do it
3019548 ultimately the story line gets more personal because it becomes not only about him trying to influence the coach
3019549 but about the pressure hes putting on his kid and coach becoming aware of that and having to intervene

3019555 it was during the persecutions that followed the valerian edicts of 257 and 258 that the imperial guard appeared at the door of the archives to confiscate them in the name of the emperor old pope sixtus had already been arrested the guards searched in vain for the administrative records and for the gold and silver that should have been in the safe all had disappeared lawrence had sent the churchs documents with their incriminating lists of names into hiding and had distributed the gold and silver in its treasury to the poor the guards put him to the fire torture on a gridiron a method commonly used in ancient times to discover the whereabouts of treasure but the librarian died without talking his charred body was claimed by the christians and his mummified skull is still in the care of the popes at the vatican on the tenth of august every year they expose in its golden reliquary the head of saint lawrence that still in the distorted mouth in the burned bone of the skull shows the agony he suffered to defend the archives of the popes
3019556 recently i went to a business lunch with some of the people i work with and a rep from another company we buy from after i placed my order i suddenly had to sneeze i grabbed my napkin as i sneezed to cover my nose i knew i had used my last tissue the day before and had not put any more in my purse so there was no need to even look
3019557 i leaned over and asked the female worker next to me if she had a tissue
3019558 as im getting up she pulls out this clump of mangled tissues covered with purse lint and hands it to me
3019559 i thought later what would i have done if i hadnt already been standing
3019560 there would be no way to politely refuse the clump of tissues but you definitely still could stand up and excuse yourself to the ladies room to blow your nose if you find yourself in this situation again it would be better to excuse yourself right after the sneeze instead of asking anyone at the table for a tissue

3019578 around 1860 the wearing of drawers of a large roomy pattem was begun at the st georges bath pimlico to the very great discomfort and annoyance of most bathers
3019579 unfortunately the comfort of bathers is interfered with by rather obtrusive regulations strictly carried out we hope that the board will some day follow the example of other establishments and leave these things to the discretion of the patrons this matter is still left to individual discretion at oxford and other places the wearing of any covering is a dirty practice it hides disease if any and prevents the water from free contact with the skin regardless how bad mens drawers may be their effect is small as compared to the absurd manner in which women cover themselves an a s a costume is all very well for mixed bathing but when bathing otherwise the sexes might be left to use their own discretion

3019587 enforcement action is one part of the solution and that is why i am today calling on our partners in the police and trading standards to get tough with anyone illegally selling knives to under 18s
3019588 i want to see more test purchasing operations like those being undertaken in birmingham to catch any unscrupulous retailers
3019589 a one off crackdown is all very well but labour are still failing to enforce the knife laws we already have
3019590 they talk tough about increasing penalties but in the last five years for which figures are available not a single person has been sent to prison for selling knives to children
3019591 ministers must ensure that those caught in future are given more than just the pathetic fines seen in recent years

3019595 it is not easy to get the law killed something of a legal disposition remains even in the believer while he is in this world many a stroke does self and self righteousness get but still it revives again if he were wholly dead to the law he would be wholly dead to sin but so far as the law lives so far sin lives they that think they know the gospel well enough bewray their ignorance no man can be too evangelical it will take all his life time to get a legal temper destroyed though the believer be delivered wholly from the law in its commanding and condemning power and authority or its rightful power that it hath over all that are under it yet he is not delivered wholly from its usurped power which takes place many times upon him while here through remaining unbelief
3019596 i have taken in hand in the name of the lord yet once again to expound this epistle of st paul to the galatians not because i desire to teach new things or such as ye have not known before since that by the grace of christ paul is now thoroughly known unto you but for that we have to fear lest satan take from us this doctrine of faith and bring into the church again the doctrine of works and mens traditions wherefore it is very necessary that this doctrine be kept in continual practice and public exercise both of hearing and reading and although it be never so well known yet the devil who rageth continually seeking to devour us is not dead likewise our flesh and old man is yet alive besides this all kinds of temptations do vex and oppress us on every side so that this doctrine can never be taught urged and repeated enough if this doctrine be lost then is also the doctrine of truth life and salvation also lost and gone if this doctrine flourish then all good things flourish religion the true service of god the glory of god the right knowledge of all things which are necessary for a christian man to know
3019597 there is a strong disposition among mankind to rest in a mere nominal and external religion they mistake the appearance for the reality the name for the thing the expression for the signification the means for the end
3019598 this doctrine can never be taught urged and repeated enough if this doctrine be lost then is also the doctrine of truth life and salvation also lost and gone if this doctrine flourish then all good things flourish religion the true service of god the glory of god the right knowledge of all things which are necessary for a christian man to know

3019600 i am not normally one to get involved in politics or public demonstrations but when i realised how the anti smacking bill would directly affect the way i was raising my children i just knew that i had to do something and i discovered very early on that i wasnt the only one who felt this way many of the parents i talked to thought the bill was ludicrous so ludicrous they felt that there wasnt even a need for a petition surely our politicians werent that blind the ironic thing about it was that many children also thought it was illogical the government was intruding yet again into the lives of parents and as a mum i was really concerned about the impact that this type of bill would have on my family through my role at focus on the family i deal with parent education and run the how to drug proof your kids programme i know how incredibly important the values instilled by parents are in a childs life to remove and undermine a parents authority in their own home is a treacherous area for the state to wade into im not speaking blindly here as the founder of focus on the family dr james dobson has dedicated his life to helping parents nurture and protect their children work that started while he was working in pediatrics over 30 years ago he found that children were falling through the cracks because parents werent given the tools to be able to raise their children so he began to provide practical ideas and techniques to mums and dads helping them to be the best parents that they can be
3019601 its important to acknowledge that even though my name is on this petition not to criminalise good parents for smacking the work of collecting the 380 000 signatures is not the work of one individual a team of people and organisations who were just as passionate as me made this happen on the 29th of february 2008 i was fortunate enough to stand on the steps of parliament with larry baldock and a group of people to hand in the boxes of signed petitions i cannot put into words how proud i was to be a kiwi that day we represented a nation of mums dads brothers sisters uncles aunties grandfathers and grandmothers who have stood on the streets in our local towns outside schools field days at sports games and at work to collect hundreds of thousands of signatures new zealanders standing up for what we believe

3019622 former attorney general mr wells said he believed outlawing smacking would force parents to discover non violent ways to discipline their children
3019623 you would just make them liable to be charged as criminals
3019624 an education program is a great idea and worth supporting but changing the criminal code to ban parental smacking is not the way to do it changing the criminal code is not an education move it is purely about punishing people for crimes
3019625 our laws already protect children against excessive force and provides the option to prosecute parents who abuse their children
3019626 nobody is suggesting parents or anyone who abuses a child should be immune from prosecution

3019633 the iphone meets our minimum requirements and can be moved to the appliance support level which means support is limited to a narrow set of applications such as voice email personal information manager and browsing

3019636 organisationally were heading towards migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3019637 the device can be wiped clean via the issuance of a standard instruction from exchange and can force the use of a complex password if the alphanumeric setting is checked on the exchange 2003 sp2 or 2007 administrative console
3019638 the iphone reacts similarly to a windows mobile device clearing contents when the security policy is violated
3019639 microsoft uses a confusing approach assuming that the end device will decide on what type of password will be enforced when the policy is received by the device there is no feedback to the console that the policy has been enforced windows mobile interprets the alphanumeric parameter as an instruction to force the user to employ a complex password the iphone replicates this function in the same manner despite microsofts awkward implementation

3019645 the company is exposed to 133 billion of securities backed by subprime and so called alt a mortgages it has reported unrealized losses on these securities but that hasnt run through the companys income statement if freddie has to realize losses of 30 on these exposures the company would probably need more than 40 billion in capital

3019674 and these rocks are basically not found in any other part of the world
3019675 theres no other explanation for how it got where we found it
3019676 it was bull dozed over from that interior region of antarctica
3019677 during the cambrian explosion about 520 million years ago we started seeing this huge expansion in the diversity of life forms
3019678 this was also a time when the earth was undergoing tremendous geologic changes
3019679 there are ideas developing about these connections between the geo tectonic world on the one hand and biology on the other
3019680 the ceasefire may be good for the people of gaza but not for us
3019681 no other european country gives 95 percent of custody to mothers
3019682 ideally custody should be 50 50 with fathers able to have input in their childrens lives
3019683 the government appears scared of womens organizations when chartering fathers entitlements
3019684 things are even worse in de facto relationships where fathers are called upon to recognize their children pay for their upbringing but have no entitlement to see them
3019685 psychiatrists and child psychologists often come in to muddle the situation in modern society both parents work and share child rearing so the same should apply in divorce its really quite simple
3019686 too often fathers begin drawn out legal battles for custody rights when the underlying motive is to reduce child support payments
3019687 during custody hearings for child support a large number of fathers suddenly become poor due to unemployment or being unfit for work judges have to gauge the actual situation and sometimes they dont have specific qualities required to try family court cases social services are sadly inadequate
3019688 recently i had the case of an alcoholic father who was unfit to have rights over his child yet the judge was not convinced of this
3019689 for a father earning 1 200 euros child payments are around 350 euros per child
3019690 i recently had the case of an english mother who lost custody simply because the father claimed that she would consider taking their child abroad
3019691 once a child is taken abroad the case leaves the greek legal system and is tried in the childs new country making it more difficult for the greek parent to get the child back
3019692 every july i get inundated with calls from divorced parents wanting their holiday visitation to be secured lawyers are called in to help alienated parents work out something that should be straightforward
3019693 its possible well try weve got one or two options were looking at and hopefully we can get something done before the start of the season
3019694 it the need for a new forward has been pressing since last season we always like to have four strikers but weve not had that but theres some light at the end of the tunnel

3019713 this is the biggest investment in community facilities in north liverpool for generations
3019714 regenerating this area is a priority for the city council and a vital part of dint that is the contribution made by community groups
3019715 we were determined that when this funding became available it would stay in this area and provide enhanced community facilities
3019716 the start of the building work is a major step forward and we look forward to the days when this work is completed
3019717 2020 liverpool are very excited to be working on these exciting new community facilities
3019718 the four projects will provide diverse and much needed improved resources to the community groups and will enable the groups to broaden their activities partnership working has been the key to the success of the projects to date
3019719 i set up the club because one of my nephews and some of his friends wanted to play and had nowhere to go
3019720 the main point of the club is to keep the team members occupied and encourage them to stay fit whilst engaging in teamwork and having lots of fun
3019721 starting up a new club is an expensive business and we are really grateful to orbit first step for helping us to get off the ground the team now has a kit they can be proud of and quality equipment to use and we cant wait until the season gets underway
3019722 orbit first steps role is not just about providing affordable homes it is also about building strong relationships with the local communities and as we are currently promoting our development of affordable new homes in nearby rushden we are pleased to support higham fc in their opening season
3019723 setting up this club as a way of helping young people find something positive to aim for is a great idea and we are looking forward to seeing how they progress over the coming months
3019724 as pessoas vinham falando nisso h algum tempo na ge rgia
3019725 o presidente georgiano mikhail saakachvili s vezes ultrapassa os limites e deu sinal verde a esta opera o
3019726 a r ssia pode se contentar de mobilizar apenas uma pequena parte de seu enorme potencial militar neste pequeno setor
3019727 h apenas uma estrada de alguns metros de cumprimento entre a r ssia e a oss tia do sul uma quest o de log stica
3019728 saakachvili colocou a r ssia numa situa o muito dif cil
3019729 n o havia projeto de enviar tropas ge rgia sem raz o mas nestas circunst ncias as autoridades russas n o tinham outra escolha com certeza uma linha vermelha para a r ssia
3019730 teria sido insensato da parte de saakachvili contar com um apoio militar direto do ocidente
3019731 mas o que o presidente georgiano conseguiu foi que o mundo inteiro v agora a r ssia como um agressor militar
3019732 i just dont agree with taking the fans away theyre putting a handcuff on the fans
3019733 i think its more of a symbolic deterrent than anything
3019734 although the key to making such a strong statement is its ability to be enforced
3019735 thats the first thing i thought about the new nfl rules theyre already on top of it
3019736 ive never been in a situation where i thought she was in danger
3019737 anyone who gets drunk swears spills beer and thinks they are a browns fan needs a reality check
3019738 theyre delicious sweet but fresh at the same time very well balanced
3019739 with consensus for the full year at 670 million the market had anticipated a downgrade to babcock albeit we are no closer to gaining comfort with cy09e calendar year 2009 earnings forecasts
3019740 the volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult
3019741 we will look to provide more detail on the 2008 outlook with our interim result to be reported on 21 august
3019742 the big question for the banks longer term is to what extent the slowing economy will have an impact on their bad debt provisions
3019743 the worst is over for the time being but thats not to say that three or four months down the track if the global economy continues to slow and potentially more companies struggle that the banks wont feel it because we are in a deleveraging cycle
3019744 the unknown of when confidence will re emerge in some sections of the financial market
3019745 we expect to see more weakness in house prices over the coming months
3019746 housing turnover has been on a steady decline since mid last year
3019747 many sellers are accepting the state of the market and dropping their expectations accordingly
3019748 the question has now changed from when will prices stop rising
3019749 the strong result for the year was driven by good sales and margin growth in pipelines and tradelink
3019750 the major disappointment in the result was our cdnz business which is the result of pretty poor conditions in new zealand and our inability to bring our costs down in line with those quick enough
3019751 while a 10 or 30 increase might be viewed as significant its likely impact on attitudes towards improved energy management is the key factor
3019752 for the majority of australian businesses this increase would see the share of energy in total costs move from perhaps 6 currently to 7 or 8 and this might occur over a 10 year time frame
3019753 there is a real question mark over whether a change of this magnitude would really obviate the need for more focused measures aimed at overcoming information and innovation barriers within business
3019754 drive lower end and middle range managers closer to the top where best practice can be found
3019755 that good risk management and responsible lending practices do not inevitably flow out of fully comprehensive credit reporting is borne out by the notorious subprime loan crisis in the us and the uk
3019756 in those jurisdictions lenders who have had access to more comprehensive information about prospective borrowers nevertheless made conspicuously poor decisions for years based on the pursuit of market share and short term incentives
3019757 the right response is well let you see the credit risk information and well impose a legal obligation on you to do the right thing with it
3019758 the current decline in lending and the general tightening of the credit market is a clear sign the system requires reform
3019759 lenders need to be able to provide a free flow of credit to consumers and businesses which is based on the most up to date and accurate data
3019760 however the board and management are confident we will see further solid improvement in profit and shareholder return in 2009 even if the current market conditions prevail
3019761 that is we have opportunities that are quite compelling for us to put our energy and efforts into to make sure we can generate value just as we have in the last 10 months
3019762 weve been quite prudent in the assumptions weve built in any one of those things can change
3019763 clearly we have some great internal candidates who will be available for selection
3019764 its not a major oil producer but there are major transport links to europe through that region
3019765 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3019766 whether we get an actual physical disruption in supply to europe that will be the critical thing
3019767 if it impacts on brent crude oil it is going to affect a much wider market and has the potential to send prices higher
3019768 losses have been pretty sharp in the last few weeks and theres always someone looking to buy on the dip
3019769 russia could consolidate as a major market for australian product over the medium to longer term
3019770 australian frozen manufacturing beef and cheaper cuts can now match brazilian prices in many overseas markets
3019771 if the drought recedes we could see a more general recovery in grazier and feedlot incomes to attractive levels
3019772 in hindsight we believe aldi has been the major beneficiary
3019773 aldi to now be a material competitive threat to many iga stores
3019774 in tough times people shop more often for less they dont want to go and spend 200 in a massive woolworths store and be subject to all the promotions and impulse buys
3019775 they spend 20 or 50 dollars to feed the family for one or two days then come back it plays right into the hands of the local store
3019776 its an impediment from the short term development of moolarben not a company stopper
3019777 if the leases are fully expunged then the worst case is they lose about 12 of their resource that doesnt make the project uneconomic
3019778 we are mindful of global economic uncertainty and the challenging cost environment but barring any unforeseen factors our current forecasts suggest another year of double digit earnings growth in 2009
3019779 rail has a strong outlook as people move from road to public transport and freight moves from trucks to trains
3019780 were an outsource provider and as long as tenants are occupying buildings well have work
3019781 weve stretched our reach in servicing the us property market and unicco is growing at record levels
3019782 we like the balance sheet where it is in the credit crisis
3019783 further divestment of non core assets and realisation of capital within the current financial year
3019784 futuris is comfortably within its debt facilities and debt covenants
3019785 it took a long time to pin the whole thing down

3019804 graincorp brings the strength of our wheat desk our up country grain accumulation and storage expertise our road and rail logistics and port infrastructure to this alliance
3019805 chs inc bring their expertise as a leading durum marketer and processor
3019806 we have no plans to insert money into either of those two institutions
3019807 given that fannie mae and freddie mac are solely involved in housing thats their sole business and given the magnitude of the housing correction weve had its not a surprise to me to see those losses
3019808 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor here in treasury
3019809 we have got some serious issues that were dealing with in our economy
3019810 i believe its going to take us well beyond the end of the year to work through all the housing problems
3019811 the period of turmoil that were going through in our capital markets today is different from some of the periods weve had in the past in that the root cause took place right in the united states of america
3019812 long term economic fundamentals of the united states compare very favourably
3019813 lets see how this program works in the third quarter
3019814 i dont know how you can justify a taxpayer led bail out and agree to pay dividends to stockholders
3019815 a better framework for dealing with systemic crises is urgently needed the policies recently instituted by the treasury and the federal reserve to deal with financial crises seem improvised rather than part of a consistent well articulated policy
3019816 there is still a risk that financial dominoes will begin to fall this is worth some careful thought if the bear stearns crisis had such a potential for disaster what will we do if a major hedge fund fails or if several crises happen at once what if the next case is worse no one in government seems to feel a responsibility for warning about such possibilities and formulating a detailed policy for dealing with them
3019817 preventing bear stearns from becoming the responsibility of the bankruptcy courts was one reason the fed felt it had to act so quickly bankruptcy law was not written with the perspective of systemic risk in mind
3019818 there is a big problem a discontinuity in macro economic outcomes when large financial institutions are at the margin between solvency and insolvency
3019819 the downside risks swamp whatever the economys upside potential would be
3019820 the rapid increases in the oil price we saw earlier in the year are not likely to continue
3019821 the unemployment rate will probably drift upwards but if it doesnt accelerate the fed will probably feel like it can begin safely raising rates
3019822 it would be surprising if the fed did not raise short term interest rates

3019835 schools although they are primarily paid for by state and local governments the federal government now provides more than 28 billion for primary and secondary education moreover washington gives some assistance in paying for children with limited english and for the children of agricultural workers illegal households impose very significant costs on the federal education budget however mainly because illegal households have more school age children on average

3019844 the steamed chickens much healthier i dont think she should be eating deep fried chicken with her throat in that state
3019845 dont give her any prawn crackers theyre bad for sore throats too
3019846 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3019847 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3019848 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3019849 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3019850 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3019851 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3019852 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3019853 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3019854 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3019855 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3019856 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3019857 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3019858 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3019859 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3019860 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3019861 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3019862 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3019868 zapatero no es de fiar y una y otra vez nos ha enga ado a los catalanes o bien mantenemos la unidad de las fuerzas pol ticas o volveremos a ser barridos

3019870 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are trying to get in the way
3019871 its military transport aircraft to relocate georgias military contingent from iraq virtually into the conflict zone
3019872 im amazed by their skills at seeing black as white of portraying aggressors as victims and of blamimg the real victims for the consequences of the conflict
3019873 as we all know saddam hussein was hanged for burning down several shiite villages but now suddenly the situation is different the georgian leaders who in a matter of hours wiped out ten ossetian villages who ran over children and the elderly with tanks who burned civilians alive those people have to be protected
3019874 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
3019875 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3019876 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3019877 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3019878 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3019879 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3019880 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3019881 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3019882 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3019883 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3019884 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3019885 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3019886 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3019887 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3019888 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3019889 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3019890 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3019891 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3019892 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3019893 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3019894 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3019895 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3019896 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3019897 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3019898 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3019899 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3019900 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3019901 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3019902 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3019903 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3019904 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3019905 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3019906 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3019907 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3019908 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3019909 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3019910 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3019911 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3019912 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

3019915 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3019916 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3019917 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3019918 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3019919 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3019920 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3019921 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3019922 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3019923 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3019924 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3019925 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3019926 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3019927 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3019928 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3019929 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3019930 who are open to doing something on the production side
3019931 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3019932 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3019933 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3019934 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3019935 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3019936 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3019937 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3019938 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3019939 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3019940 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3019941 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3019942 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

3019966 in yesterdays most recent tank attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to be black possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet
3019967 there were blacks among the dead who were probably either mercenaries or instructors in the georgian armed forces
3019968 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
3019969 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
