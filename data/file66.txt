660182 would literally take away with one hand what has been given with the other
660183 the nsg guidelines apply to non nuclear weapons states nnws so our preference is for the nsg to simply say that these guidelines do not apply to india if they are unwilling to say that at a minimum the requirement of full scope safeguards and other prescriptive elements in the guidelines that are intended for nnws must be waived for india
660184 if you read the nsg guidelines as a whole right at the top it says these prescriptions are for non nuclear weapon states there is an enunciation of the requirement that countries must accept full scope safeguards there is language about what happens if one of these states tests there is restrictive language on enrichment and reprocessing enr equipment and so on
660185 of course we are very clear that there cannot be any linkage with nuclear tests
660186 but just as in the 123 agreement with the u s there cannot be any explicit linkage to nuclear testing as a condition in the nsg
660187 i am not interested in labels like the npt definition of a nuclear weapon state because we are what we are
660188 but certainly we dont want the other label to be attached to us either
660189 are any of these elements present in those agreements so our view is that all these things in the nsg are extraneous tomorrow if the political situation changes all these things can create difficulties

660196 legitimate political interference in the functioning of cbi is part of the democratic mandate but the premier investigative agency will always guard itself against any illegitimate interference said ashwani kumar the new director designate of the countrys top investigative agency here on friday
660197 there was functional autonomy while discharging professional duties in the organization
660198 cbi should be able to fill the role provided it gets the government support for it
660199 expanding the agencys role is purely the governments prerogative but in the present pretext it was not possible
660200 the impact of the rising fuel prices on the local economy is extremely serious

660208 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
660209 and one of the challenges moving forward is to expand and bring in more talent people from other campaigns and other places and still maintain that culture we began with i think its happening but its a process and it fights the normal physics of national politics

660242 im not sure but i think one or both of them did a piss poor job healing black eyes on the other i could still see the graying of the skin and a slightly shifted nose
660243 well you know ron hes always been overly protective of me and well harry wasnt about to give in this time harrys no wimp you know besides they were all buddy buddy by the time they saw me
660244 boyfriend sort of john hes a muggle but he knows what i am
660245 i mean i did get a letter about four months ago and he seemed fine but
660246 hes pretty good working a lot of hours with harry
660247 i know he still cares but he just doesnt want to show it
660248 not a steady girlfriend but he has seen a few girls nothing serious mind you
660249 i never meant for us to grow apart you know
660250 i didnt plan for school to do this to us
660251 you dont have to explain to me hermione i understand busy believe me anyway speaking of i have to get back but you have to come over for dinner later
660252 yes tonight harry will be so happy to see you so how about six oclock do you know how to find harrys house
660253 oh he decided it was a waste of money to throw down on a flat each month so he bought a place its much too big for him if you ask me but he keeps hinting that hell find a way to fill it soon
660254 you couldnt just drop the wand had to keep it up didnt you had to put up a fight
660255 fuck diane i almost cursed you into the next room
660256 well what do you expect when i come home and find someone trespassing in my flat
660257 i know i did but i just didnt expect to find you sitting in my flat when i came home
660258 i just wanted to stop by and see if we could do something tonight i have the whole night free
660259 ginny told me about your visit today and i couldnt believe it hermione granger has come back to the roost
660260 well you can still come visit as much as you like use the library i have to admit i thought of you when i saw that room for the first time i could just see your face light up at the concept of filling those shelves
660261 i think that would be a bit of a stretch for me
660262 i got an owl from the ministry this afternoon about a job so ill head over tomorrow and see what becomes of it
660263 well ive been trying to find a cure for this new nearly virulent strain of bacteria that is affecting pure bloods it seems to have started out as a rather innocuous bacterium and were not sure how it mutated into its current form but its pretty nasty
660264 should you be working with this stuff if youre pure blood yourself what if you catch this
660265 oh im careful besides im working with a dead version of the strain were trying to figure out how it attaches itself to the magical cells in the body the stronger those cells the faster it seems to grow hence the fact its affecting pure bloods more so than others
660266 not so far no but a few have come close we really need to get a handle on this soon before it does take some poor soul
660267 he has done wonders over there he came up with a whole new interview and hiring procedure and implemented it and overhauled the training program as well
660268 look you dont have to tip toe around in front of me its alright to talk about him hes still my friend
660269 is there something i should know you two are looking mighty guilty about something
660270 hermione we dont mean to act out of sorts its just that ron went through a bit of a tough time after you left
660271 what do you mean he never said anything in this letters what happened
660272 um gin im just going to clear these dishes and make some tea you two can talk
660273 yeah hes fine now you know ron he doesnt wear his heart on his sleeve hes pretty good at brooding so im sure he never let on about any of this to you in his letters
660274 he was really down when you left he acted all supportive and chipper but the day you took off he locked himself in his flat and we didnt see him for about four days i think he only came out because he got so hungry he couldnt stand it anymore
660275 ginny i know i asked before but are you being straight with me does he have a girlfriend
660276 um well hes been out with some different ladies but i dont think its serious with any of them
660277 how i ran off to sweden because a fortune teller said i was supposed to meet my future husband
660278 in which somebody runs into somebody else and then something falls and the two people began to talk and their eyes meet and they realize that they are attracted to one another

660301 we hope that catholics around the state will recognize the moral and civic duty they have as catholics and citizens to vote and to do so with a properly formed conscience
660302 if we as catholics want to effect change in our society and culture we must vote and encourage our friends and family to do the same
660303 the catholic church certainly understands and also believes in the separation of church and state
660304 but that doesnt mean we believe in the separation of faith and politics

660315 we would like to reiterate our confidence in our national courts and justice and all the institutions of our government
660316 we would like to affirm our striving for a political solution of the darfur problem
660317 we shall also go on with the democratic process and start the elections on its date
660318 it might be good for the guys bring us back to earth and make us work harder
660319 it reinforces how hard it is to win on the road we need that heading to south africa next
660320 we got shown up by new zealand and that wont happen again
660321 if you think winning away from home is tough then its tough
660322 the great thing is we are in the tri nations and it is wide open
660323 you have just seen a vivid example of how one week is no indicator of the next
660324 we will hang on to the things we believe in and of the limited amount of quality ball we got we actually showed good signs
660325 you want to win every test match so the guys are disappointed but knowing there are still three games to go we are only halfway through the competition you dont really have time to dwell on any losses
660326 thats what ill do it would mean the country wants to go backwards towards fear anti intellectualism i dont know i dont even want to think about it
660327 its totally possible were often in the situation where the democrat loses george bush was a terrible terrible president but karl rove was very sly and he put together a very mannered strategy that worked there are plenty of uninformed voters out there and all you have to do is scare them
660328 when you ask most americans who the best american presidents were they say washington lincoln fdr and then they add kennedy and reagan
660329 those two gave the country hope and inspired so many people jfk with the new frontier and reagan with morning in america
660330 that said people remember negative ads candidates use them because they are effective
660331 senator obama is an impressive orator and its a lucky thing for me that people arent just choosing a motivational speaker
660332 washington is full of talented talkers and senator obama is one of the best to come along in quite a while unfortunately on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
660333 he is increasingly going to take his campaign into the gutter i think john mccain has harmed himself in the last week really eroding any capital he had built up in terms of the kind of politician he is

660336 at a time when many companies including our competitors are constantly cutting costs to the detriment of their product we are constantly looking to improve our product

660338 casa is just doing their job and as i said we would encourage them to do that and we would always wants to be transparent and open about what we are doing
660339 i am anxious to put this on the table now not wheel it out in response to a bad performance here
660340 australias reputation is founded on gallantry in times of war and results on the international sporting field
660341 we have led the way in the last eight years in participation finishing fourth in the medals tally but my sense is that we are being left behind
660342 where it goes from here well have to wait and see its possible the situation will get quite a bit worse in credit markets
660343 things are going extremely well but thats a matter for us to sit down and talk to the ratings agencies and to assure them thats the case
660344 as in the first century we can expect the holy spirit to press us to listen to each other to state new insights frankly and to accept implications of the gospel new to us whether painful or exhilarating

660346 they were the one team to get a big time prospect laportas going to hit forty home runs in the majors some year one gm said plus the catcher they got from the dodgers for the serviceable and versatile casey blake carlos santana is a pretty good one who has no evil ways
660347 the main cause of excessive cracking in the crosshead to the t shaped pier is a deficiency in the design and the anchorage of the columns reinforced into the crosshead there is also a deficiency in the design of the transverse reinforcement in the top of the crossheads to resist splitting forces between bearings the horizontal cracking in the crosshead directly above the columns is a direct result of the inadequate anchorage of the column bars into the crosshead
660348 they have assured us that the repair work on 31 pillars would be completed in 4 1 2 months
660349 there is no point in spending more and not being able to use it
660350 as an example the mrr2 project has the contractor and concessionaire constantly pointing fingers at each other the problems were with the design and construction
660351 the contractor shall be fully responsible for the design execution and maintenance of the work portion of the works for which the design have been accepted by the government and shall absolutely guarantee the government independent of fault that the design materials and workmanship for the works or portion of the works is suitable for the known requirement of the government
660352 the contractor shall take full and unequivocal responsibility for the safety of the design and for the adequacy stability and safety of all site operations and methods of construction

660367 i stayed in contact with he and his dad i look at these guys like theyre my own kids and if he were my son and he wanted to do it id let him do it
660368 hes our quarterback and hes the guy not only the offense looks to but the entire team
660369 you have to understand the position that the program is in and position youre in
660370 ive grown up in new jersey and i know how the people are they want you to be successful and they expect you to be successful i dont think anyone likes to get booed ive grown up and understood thats the way it is
660371 he told me its not about what the fans think or what the media thinks
660372 its about what you do for your team and how you prepare week in and week out that kind of got me through things
660373 when you look at the two i dont know if theres a better duo in the country
660374 theyre two tremendously talented athletes the thing that makes them so special is they do different things kennys a big physical guy that will go over middle and catch the ball and make plays ty is a guy who gets himself open he finds weaknesses in the defense
660375 20 38 pdt we have heard from launch control that there has been an anomaly more details will be posted to the website as available

660380 i have a rather muscular heart im very glad i am not sick i will still be able to play with my children and friends with a football
660381 but considering my age 36 and the wishes of my mum i understand that this is the time to stop it would not be fair for me to make those who are important to me undergo such fear
660382 can teach you about life but it is no substitute for life if you see what i mean for the real world for real problems real conflicts
660383 we changed the game plan around and the guys executed that exceptionally well
660384 the next contest is going to be massive because both teams will have an equal amount of edge
660385 we camped down their end of the field for periods and got the points we were after
660386 not one well reflect on with a lot of pride and that reflected the way the game went
660387 the all blacks built pressure and didnt allow us to build any pressure
660388 the harder we tried the more we seemed to dig ourselves into a hole
660389 well lick our wounds well get a break now for a week and regroup
660390 there has not been anybody with that kind of high profile whos played that many games been small town america had all the records has not been injured and ended up one game away from a super bowl

660394 when i first came up in 1997 the money wasnt that good
660395 what we did and why we were so successful is that we turned it over to the skaters themselves
660396 more kids skateboard than play little league baseball this is a fabulous opportunity to be involved in a lifestyle and culture
660397 when somebodys saying whats cool and whats not we dont think a corporate platform should dictate that it should be the skate community
660398 we said guys we want to present vert in a different way
660399 considering all the athletes involved making this dream come true was a rather intimidating task
660400 we wanted to tell these stories in a creatively unique way
660401 so we chose to tell them through the eyes of fans and through the athletes as fans i dont think theres been another film quite like it
660402 after going through 300 hours of stories were just putting the finishing touches on it
660403 we hope that when it premieres it will serve as a major source of inspiration
660404 its like getting a firsthand perspective from anyone who lived in those moments only years later
660405 i hope anyone who sees it becomes inspired enough to overcome obstacles in their lives and to dream bigger than they have ever dreamed

660410 the best way to manufacture a run is through base running
660411 whether its taking the extra base scoring from first on a long single or just going first to third it doesnt matter come on this isnt reinventing the wheel this is john mcgraw
660412 its just that no one noticed everybodys asleep when were playing
660413 when people talk about us they talk about the team not individual accomplishments
660414 we take pride in it we win as a team and lose as a team

660540 mass circumcision campaigns will result in hundreds of thousands of complications and could make the hiv crisis worse
660541 there are already numerous reports of males lining up to get circumcised so they no longer will need to use condoms
660542 male circumcision is a dangerous distraction in the hiv battle even if circumcision does offer some degree of reduced risk per sexual incident individuals engaged in high risk behavior are still at risk for hiv and circumcision does not protect women giving circumcised males and their partners the false impression that they are protected will make the situation worse by increasing risk taking behavior further mass circumcision campaigns will likely overwhelm the already overburdened african healthcare infrastructure and divert resources away from other needed and more effective hiv prevention strategies

660566 ive made the decision to stand down as england captain
660567 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
660568 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
660569 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
660570 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
660571 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
660572 i will take a break from the game so i wont be playing at the oval
660573 i just want to try and freshen up the mind and get back to playing as a batsman i do believe these could be the best years of my playing career
660574 thats the one thing i want to get back doing
660575 in new zealand i had a few thoughts that i might go
660576 it is a fairytale to captain your country but it hasnt had a fairytale ending i know that it is the right time because my mind told me it was my body is working well but my mind is not
660577 i wish whoever gets the job all the luck in the world its a great privilege
660578 michael led from the front and led with honesty and integrity every step of the way

660580 paul feels this is the best decision in terms of benefiting the england team and his contribution to the team
660581 we are extremely grateful for way paul led the one day side since last year
660582 the selection committee is currently considering the squad and captain for the fourth test and natwest series these squads along with the captain will be announced tomorrow monday
660583 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket
660584 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game
660585 i feel the england captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team
660586 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
660587 the last thing i want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the team which is why ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration
660588 i will continue to make myself available to england for all forms of cricket and look forward to playing a significant role in englands future success
660589 i think i did the best of the worst if you like in the end

660597 violent or sexual trauma were associated with the highest rates of symptoms
660598 the post traumatic stress symptoms were predicted by previous exposure to multiple traumas anxiety disorders and family adversity
660599 across childhood the children who experience trauma are often those with anxiety depressive and disruptive behavior disorders a finding supported in the present study
660600 this likely reflects common liability conveyed from a limited set of family risk factors
660601 in the general population of children potentially traumatic events are fairly common and do not often result in post traumatic stress symptoms except after multiple traumas or a history of anxiety
660602 the prognosis after the first lifetime trauma exposure was generally favorable apart from ptsd traumatic events are related to many forms of psychopathology with the strongest links being with anxiety and depressive disorders

660650 which u s president has done the most in history to help africa
660651 ill be dead when they finally figure it out bush said in an interview last week
660652 theres no such thing as short term history so i am very confident in telling you that ill be long gone before somebody finally figures out the true merit and meaning of the bush administration
660653 one of the most remarkable features of this struggle is that almost from the start and at almost every turn along the way the bush administration was warned that whatever the short term benefits of its extralegal approach to fighting terrorism it would have tragically destructive long term consequences both for the rule of law and americas interests in the world
660654 the bush administration invoked the fear flowing from the attacks on september 11 to institute a policy of deliberate cruelty that would have been unthinkable on september 10 mayer writes
660655 president bush vice president cheney and a small handful of trusted advisers sought and obtained dubious legal opinions enabling them to circumvent american laws and traditions
660656 when warned that these policies were unlawful and counterproductive they ignored the experts and made decisions outside of ordinary bureaucratic channels and often outside of the publics view

660659 the study which is mandated by congress was conducted by researchers from abt associates and the university of pennsylvania center for mental health services and research
660660 the department of housing and urban development has financed 10 000 to 12 000 additional permanent housing units every year for the past four years which may explain the more than 50 000 fewer chronically homeless persons detailed in the report

660708 maybe if we stop talking to our customers theyll stop calling about their problems
660709 why did i punch in my account number and my phone number if youre just going to ask for it again
660710 why did you ask for my account number if youre just going to ask for it again
660711 if you have to punch it in on the phone that proves you have all the information the agent is going to need when you finally get one
660712 i think youre asking a question about tax reporting is that right

660721 betrayal of the teaching of the missionaries who brought the faith and it is experienced as a new form of colonisation
660722 we havent talked about the gospel we havent talked about salvation and we havent talked about the fact that the mission of the church is to proclaim the one hope that we have in the world the lord jesus christ the fact that we have missed the very central message of christianity says a lot about what is happening in the anglican communion
660723 i would hate to see the anglican communion finish i hope theres a way we can all remain as anglicans together im not hopeful i do not really believe that we are moving towards a situation in anglicanism when we really are going to be able to put this thing back together again i think the toothpaste has been squeezed out of the tube and i dont think we can put it back i think whatever is coming up will look very different and will be very different
660724 from my experience of the bible studies and of the indaba discussions i see a great wall being put up by revisionists against those orthodox who believe in the authority of scripture the revisionists among us push upon us the view that current secular culture and not the bible should shape our mission and morals in this we are not divided by mere trivialities or issues on the periphery of faith but on essentials i am shocked to say that we are finding it very hard to come together on even the essentials of the faith we once received from the apostles
660725 everywhere we go here we meet gay amp lesbian activists receive their news letters or read about their many events they are intent to push their agenda on us no other lobbying groups seem to enjoy similar access or to be able to have their literature prominently displayed all over the campus and at the entrance to every residence they are determined that their way is the only right way and that everyone else should follow they are not at all open to listening to us or the historic church teaching yet is surprising that they push all these sexuality issues so intensively into the conference and then blame us for talking about them too much
660726 i am more convinced than ever that none of this will help us those who have stayed away will not agree to it and will continue their ministry in the states and tec the episcopal church in the us will continue to bleat that they won t follow the moratoria while these africans continue to ignore it the draft statement that will be released is so full of generalizations it says absolutely nothing i am deeply dismayed at the spinelessness of the communion

660741 say to the israelites a woman who becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son will be ceremonially unclean for seven days just as she is unclean during her monthly period
660742 when the days of her purification for a son or daughter are over she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting a year old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a dove for a sin offering
660743 these are the regulations for the woman who gives birth to a boy or a girl
660744 speak to the israelites and say to them when any of you brings an offering to the lord bring as your offering an animal from either the herd or the flock
660745 if the offering is a burnt offering from the herd he is to offer a male without defect he must present it at the entrance to the tent of meeting so that it will be acceptable to the lord
660746 if the offering is a burnt offering from the flock from either the sheep or the goats he is to offer a male without defect
660747 if the offering to the lord is a burnt offering of birds he is to offer a dove or a young pigeon

660774 if they can capitalise on pre existing fears the electorate has about obama or hesitations they have about him it can be an effective strategy
660775 senator obama is an impressive orator and its a lucky thing for me that people arent just choosing a motivational speaker
660776 washington is full of talented talkers and senator obama is one of the best to come along in quite a while unfortunately on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things

660811 harry harry pay attention sometimes you are worse than ron i swear
660812 as i was telling you before you spaced out on me ron and i arent going to be able to come over and watch the cannons game with you tomorrow night
660813 molly and arthur have invited the entire family over for dinner every now and then they have the family over beyond the normal sunday lunch it has become a new tradition since the war when we made plans ron and i had forgotten were sorry harry can we come over the next night
660814 as i told the new deputy department head we need to start at the beginning and find a whole new measure to get the entire project back to where
660815 what would you have us discuss then george the latest exploding product from your shop
660816 it would be far more lively than listening to ministry measurement details i know how about we discuss rons little mishap at auror training class today
660817 harry it is so good to see you what are you here for would you like to come in
660818 hermione mentioned a family dinner and that it had become a tradition
660819 i thought i could do this i miss everyone and im tired of being alone but itt too hard i am too scared of being hurt again
660820 you dont have to come back inside harry merlin i wouldnt blame you if you never forgave them at all
660821 if you think there is the slightest chance you can move past this i would come back inside no one expects you to just forget but the longer you wait the harder it will be
660822 no matter what youre still my friend and my brother
660823 i thought maybe i could join you and the family for dinner
660824 i didnt harry weve set your place everyday for almost two years now hoping that you would come back to us
660825 i would like you to see something harry if you dont mind
660826 i thought you would like to see this considering how badly we messed up last time he loved you you know he loved all of us
660827 thank you for showing me he was a great friend
660828 sure percy just dont start on me again or im going to hex you
660829 i would like to offer my sincerest apologies for that day i have no excuses i was still hurting from being separated from my family for so long when i had just got them back we lost fred i know it was not your fault please forgive me for giving into my anger and saying those things to you
660830 im sorry percy i dont like you im not sure i will ever be able to look at you again without getting angry however i appreciate your sentiments ill do the best i can and maybe in the future we can work this out
660831 i understand harry and i look forward to that day
660832 so where is ginny tonight i thought this was a family dinner
660833 we thought you would know better than us she hasnt spoken to anyone in the family in weeks surely she told you this at the flat
660834 i havent seen her at the flat in weeks myself i mean i know she is there
660835 but we havent spoken in a while i think she is avoiding me why has she not spoken to you all
660836 we had a row over some of her behaviour she hasnt spoken to us since
660837 perhaps we have been too harsh should we go check on her
660838 maybe harry can feel out the situation for us can you do that son
660839 i can first however i need to say something though tonight has been great and im really glad that i came i just cant forget everything thats happened its going to take a while and i just need you to know that
660840 i also need a promise from each of you that you wont meddle in my life again for my own good i appreciate your insights and your opinions but you need to understand my life is mine i fought for it i died for it
660841 go behind my back again and i promise you we will never be friends again
660842 ginny you need to go see your mum and dad your whole family actually they miss you and they are worried
660843 how would you know that i thought you hated them
660844 i went to the family dinner tonight and had a long talk with your family including percy weve pretty much made up im not going to say its all perfect or even that i still dont have some anger i realized tonight that they are still my family though
660845 they love you and they want to know that you are alright believe me ginny you dont want to keep yourself from them over arguments and hurt feelings go to them they will forgive you
660846 its not that easy gin things just cant go back to the way they were the only reason im talking to you at all right now is so that youll go see the family i cant talk about anything else with you im sorry
660847 how could it possibly be peeves professor dumbledore said that only really dark magic could have done that to mrs norris
660848 i mean the voice maybe it was his idea of a joke find some way to make only one or two people hear it and lead them off across the castle chasing nothing
660849 doesnt mean anything he can go through walls cant he itd be easy for him to beat us out of the dungeons
660850 why would peeves lead them right to the place where mrs norris had just been petrified
660851 maybe it was just coincidence we dont know exactly where the voice was coming from do we
660852 you were just running down that corridor because you thought it was the right direction
660853 we heard it from there though it wasnt just running along ahead of us it was above us to begin with that was obvious in the pensieve
660854 couldve been loads of places and youd have still ended up there
660855 or maybe it was peeves way of telling someone about the attack you know he wouldnt just float up to dumbledore and say it
660856 if you tell us what youre looking for we can help you find it
660857 its not a detail if youre carrying on like this weve hardly seen you in days
660858 its just i read something in hogwarts a history and now ive forgotten it i hate forgetting things its very frustrating
660859 err why dont you just check hogwarts a history then instead of all of these
660860 i couldnt fit it in my trunk not with all of professor lockharts books and i knew that there were several copies here in the library but theyre all checked out already
660861 all of the books i could remember that were used as references for
660862 but why dont you ask your parents to send your copy
660863 because theyre muggles its easy enough to send them something with a school owl but they cant readily get to any owls themselves if they want to send me a letter they have to write it really quickly and send it with the same owl i used to write to them
660864 but they sent your birthday presents last year and this year
660865 yes and to do that they had to go to london have tom let them into diagon alley and then hire an owl at the post office we havent found a closer post yet if there is one im not going to ask them to do all that unless its absolutely necessary
660866 its just not as easy for us as it would be for magical families
660867 its not your fault why should you think about it youre both from magical families originally anyway and now mostly
660868 she went to your house loads of times over the summer
660869 shes not just a mail carrier harry shes your friend and she obviously thinks for herself it didnt seem fair to ask you to get her to fly all that way just for me
660870 well go up to the owlery and you can ask her yourself if she doesnt want to do it shell tell us
660871 if hermione wants to send a letter or something in future would you mind if she went and talked to you herself ginny and i are always happy to see you and well go along if we can of course
660872 ill have to do it at lunch we dont want to be late for transfiguration
660873 we will revisit the warming draught you were supposed to have learned last year
660874 brewing this potion will require the entire lesson if you work quickly and carefully you should be prepared to drink your own potion at the end of class begin
660875 given the elapsed time since i last checked this potion it is impossible for you to have produced this result by following the proscribed procedure five points from gryffindor
660876 i see that neither of you even reached the final stage of preparation
660877 clearly i should never have allowed you to advance to this level five points each from gryffindor
660878 beverages are not allowed in my classroom weasley clearly you did not listen to me last year or today and you did not bother to read the instructions i am hardly surprised ten points from gryffindor and detention tonight after dinner class dismissed
660879 that water wont last long you need to eat some bread or something to soak up the potion
660880 if you added the mooncalf milk too late you probably just made a sort of highly concentrated hot sauce
660881 when i first saw that i was sure id read something about it somewhere and i thought it was in this
660882 well i wasnt completely sure and i didnt actually remember any of the details so it wouldnt have been much use
660883 well according to this salazar slytherin decided that only students from all wizarding families should be allowed to attend hogwarts godric gryffindor helga hufflepuff and rowena ravenclaw disagreed especially gryffindor and they all got pretty heated about it finally slytherin left the school and never came back
660884 well that parts a legend as dumbledore said but its in the book supposedly slytherin built a secret chamber somewhere in the castle when he left he sealed it so that only his true heir would be able to open it again then the heir would be able to release the monster slytherin left in there and the monster would purge the school of everyone who slytherin thought was unfit to learn magic
660885 its just a legend the book says that no one has ever found any sort of secret chamber
660886 well i suppose it does a bit it could just be a legend though
660887 besides professor dumbledores here even people who dont like him admit that hes the greatest wizard of the century
660888 but im really not sure would the real heir be quite so obvious about it
660889 he got someone else to do the dirty work for him
660890 you dont really think hed do dark magic like that do you
660891 and we saw lucius malfoy in that dark arts shop remember said he was selling stuff and i bet it wasnt his old chocolate frog cards
660892 weve been trying to find one just like everyone else but the swotty ravenclaws are hoarding them all
660893 apparently they all bolted to the library before breakfast on sunday
660894 it figures that slytherin himself started the whole pureblood mess
660895 people whove seen it are telling the story but lots of people want to read it for themselves
660896 do you honestly think that binns would notice if we were late
660897 it doesnt matter ron were supposed to be there and if were not we might miss something really important
660898 not anywhere near you and theyre all trying to get out not trying to get in
660899 you dont but we use them all the time in potions
660900 one of the twins favourite tricks when we were little was to turn things into giant moving spiders
660901 is that what you call it when spiders make you behave like that
660902 just dont make him come over here and dont joke around about the spiders going over there
660903 what are they doing up there anyway ive never seen spiders act like that
660904 i bet the water was coming from in there but im not about to go in and look around
660905 oh dont worry ron nobody ever goes in there if they can help it thats where moaning myrtle lives
660906 yes i suppose we can put up with her long enough to ask if she saw anything
660907 we told them how nice your toilet is and they wanted to see it
660908 no myrtle honestly we just wanted to talk to you
660909 we just wanted to know if you saw anything odd on sunday night a cat was attacked right outside your door
660910 why should i be bothered about some stupid cat im dead you know
660911 is it funny teasing a dead person thats all people ever did even when i was alive myrtles too stupid for magic lets play keep away with her glasses and now its just the same youre dead myrtle did you notice i
660912 what were you doing in there thats a girls toilet
660913 shes the ghost who lives in there no one ever uses it as a toilet anymore
660914 that doesnt matter its a girls toilet and boys should not be going inside its impolite at best and its against the rules
660915 we were just talking to myrtle you know being nice to her you might try it sometime
660916 we were talking to myrtle we tried to be nice to her and percys a raging git
660917 lets just use his name because its easy to say
660918 it could be almost anyone ron and we shouldnt start blaming him until we know a bit more
660919 the secrets probably been passed down through his family for the last thousand years
660920 he and his dad finally decided to try it out or something
660921 who knows they could be trying to scare everyone enough that malfoy can win at quidditch or something else stupid like that
660922 it would really help if we knew it was him hush ron im serious if we knew for sure we could watch him and try to work out how hes controlling the monster if we stop him doing that the rest doesnt matter
660923 there is there is one way i can think of
660924 say malfoy are you the heir of slytherin were doing an article on slytherin bigotry for the prophet here speak into my wand so i can be sure to hear you were the last people hed tell no matter what
660925 hed tell us if he thought we were his friends
660926 look theres this potion called polyjuice potion remember professor snape talking about it
660927 its a potion that allows the drinker to take on the physical appearance of someone else its the ultimate disguise if we look like dracos friends hell tell us anything and if hes not the heir of slytherin he might know who is
660928 im sure its extremely complex but if we could do it
660929 i tried to look it up out of curiosity but the recipe isnt in just any potions book the only one i know for sure has it is moste potente potions and its in the restricted section
660930 no professors going to give us a note to get a book from there
660931 but what if we convinced a professor that we wanted the book as as a reference item you know for background reading
660932 hes always been quite nice to me when ive spoken to him after class
660933 and it wouldnt surprise him at all that you wanted to do a bit more reading would it
660934 learn about some wonky potion he used to whiten his teeth while fighting off hags with his other hand
660935 yeah hed buy that in an instant lets do it
660936 first he had me write i will not ignore instructions on the wall of his classroom a hundred times in everlasting ink then he made me scrub it all off with nothing but a towel and a bucket of water
660937 im never going to get it off of me now
660938 i tried scourgify but all it did was rub me raw that one barely even tickled
660939 isnt there a special charm for removing ink stains from skin though
660940 do you and hermione want to watch the match with us on saturday
660941 i thought you two might want to get away from ron while harrys playing padma and some others are going to be there this time too
660942 want to sit with parvati and lavender for the match we can probably beg off if you dont
660943 is it all right if my friend luna comes too i was planning to meet up with her
660944 shes fun well be there and i bet hermione will want to come along too
660945 new spells to learn the ink removal charm is in there somewhere
660946 i was thinking about the potion you used to make yourself fit in with the yeti
660947 im sure its beyond my ability to brew it of course but im very curious about how the gelatinous ingredients can be saturated with the powdered ingredients without losing their salinity
660948 i wouldnt want to trouble you about it but the full recipe is in this book
660949 there you are after all who am i to interfere with the curiosity of the best student in her year
660950 go on then im sure you want to get to the library just as soon as possible
660951 im so curious about how the gooey ingredients can be stirred up with the ground ingredients without losing their stupidity
660952 id like to get a book from the restricted section i have the proper note here signed by a professor
660953 well get you another autograph lockhartll sign anything if it stays still long enough you could get him to sign your forehead i bet
660954 a potion plan fred showed me how to make it
660955 wouldnt be the first time the twins kept a secret
660956 well we havent done anything yet that really calls for one of these
660957 you start by putting in the potion youre trying to make then you use the instructions and work backwards marking when you need to do the different things required to brew the potion so see an hour before you want the potion to be ready you have to start sprinkling ground lacewing flies into the potion and you do that for the whole last hour
660958 thats if you have all of the ingredients ready to go at the right times if you dont there are stages where the potion can just simmer but then it takes longer overall
660959 seriously malfoy could have attacked half the school by then
660960 there are quite a lot of them but only a few are problematic luckily ive got a bit of bicorn horn that should work boomslang skin though thats going to be pretty tricky to get and of course a bit of whomever we want to change into
660961 how do you expect the potion to know who we want to look like
660962 so if we want to look like crabbe and goyle
660963 we have to put their fingers in there or something
660964 no ron honestly it can be anything most people use hairs
660965 ill have to check to make sure we have the right quantity and that nothings rotted once thats done we can get started
660966 we can leave a cauldron simmering in there for weeks and no one will notice im sure she wont tell anyone no one talks to her to begin with
660967 let us know when youre ready and tell us if we can help
660968 just because they have brand new brooms doesnt mean theyre going to win
660969 knock him off his broom if you can thatd save some time
660970 shes in first year luna these are lavender parvati susan and hannah
660971 but shes down at the pitch saving seats you already know her right
660972 you dont know how hard it is to save eight seats on the front row
660973 i almost had to hex a couple of fifth year boys
660974 we havent before with this many people but i hope we will from now on
660975 the ravenclaws all sit together when theyre playing though and they dont let anyone else sit with them so therell be fewer of us then
660976 anyway i dont think anyone will mind where we sit as long as were cheering for the proper team
660977 were too close to your robes for anyone to believe anything else
660978 we all know what were up against slytherin have got the better kit but weve got the better flyers weve been practicing harder in all weather conditions and we have more experience as a team get out there fly like i know you can and show them that rich daddies dont win quidditch matches
660979 its all down to you harry malfoys new and hes not as good a flier but that broomll be hard to catch your job is to teach him that his broom wont automatically make him a good seeker therere no points on the board yet so just get that snitch before he does or die trying if we dont win this one well have a hard time competing for the cup and i want to keep it in gryffindor where it belongs dont you
660980 and the quaffle is stolen by pucey in spite of a nice switcheroo hold by alicia spinnet of gryffindor
660981 wed always prefer to beat a team that actually played even if it doesnt matter in the end
660982 well leave off were trying to break one of those fancy brooms
660983 hide behind your beater and wait for the snitch to come to you
660984 why arent we getting more bludgers in there to disrupt their offence
660985 one of the bludgers has been after him all game i swear wood its been tampered with
660986 im telling you wood one of them hasnt left harry alone ive beat it off at least a dozen times and it just turns around and comes right back towards him
660987 get her to stop the game and inspect the bludgers
660988 they might reschedule the game and wed have to start all over
660989 i can outrun that bludger but i cant find the snitch if someones always flying around me with a bat let me handle the bludger and you two can concentrate on the slytherins
660990 im sure ginny would say the same thing if she were playing
660991 harry find that snitch as fast as you can but watch out for yourself if that bludger really is enchanted theres no telling what else they might try
660992 once the match really gets going you cant talk to her
660993 thats eighty twenty and it looks like the slytherins might have lost their momentum amazing work by the gryffindor seeker
660994 and its still eighty to twenty with gryffindor in possession again
660995 well i know of one that might work but ive never done it
660996 im pretty sure its a swish and poke spell ive just never tried it
660997 incredible flying no one else at hogwarts could have done that on any broom in the world did you see the look on flints face
660998 did you see it after harry caught the snitch theyre never that fast
660999 i am aware that something was amiss with the bludger
661000 however unless i am sorely mistaken your sister eliminated any possible evidence of tampering
661001 my thanks youve just provided us with a rather oddly shaped doorstop
661002 i just thought it had to be stopped because it couldve
661003 fear not miss weasley clearly there was something seriously wrong with this bludger and clearly it needed to be stopped quickly i would have done the same thing myself we can have it re charmed as it would have undoubtedly needed that anyway
661004 perhaps you should see to your team they appear to be somewhat agitated
661005 there is no evidence to indicate how the bludger might have been tampered with and nothing at all to implicate anyone at this school
661006 well then as much as i do enjoy a good game of quidditch i am always glad when they do not interfere with lunch shall we
661007 brilliant flying and all that but insane absolutely ruddy barking
661008 soon youll be causing mayhem all on your own without us or any mad bludgers to help
661009 at least we got to be part of the adventure for once and we didnt even have to try very hard thats always a good thing now what will you do for us if we dont tell mum and dad about that little stunt
661010 well talk okay but lets go down to the common room that way err you can be comfortable too
661011 ginny and harry potter are too great too clever for poor dobby nothing else worked
661012 what do you hang on you stopped us getting onto platform 9 didnt you
661013 dobby had no idea they could get to hogwarts themselves no wizards can go to hogwarts like that even if they can go to other places how could they do it but they did
661014 dobby would never ever kill harry potter send him to hospital only away from hogwarts but never kill him
661015 you dont have to punish yourself its okay just tell us why
661016 already it has begun danger ginny and harry potter must go away far away from hogwarts
661017 what kind of danger do you mean the chamber of secrets the monster
661018 err is it malfoy draco malfoy you can just shake or nod
661019 obviously you cant talk about any of that stuff forget it okay if were not asking you dont have to punish yourself
661020 i could give you a shirt or something instead of that manky old pillowcase
661021 harry potter is most generous but dobby cannot accept clothes from anyone but his master and his master will never ever give him clothes
661022 surely theyve got a spare shirt lying around at least
661023 if a master gives him real clothes then he is free of the master free to leave the house and do whatever he can think of so no house elf wears clothes master doesnt even hand dobby things for washing he throws them on the floor for dobby to pick up instead
661024 look if you ever want to talk to us again thats fine but send us a note or something if you wake up my roommates while ginnys there well be in loads of trouble
661025 very well ginny and harry potter you is still being too nice to dobby but he will do as you asks goodbye
661026 yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me
661027 for god has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind

661030 when the spirit of god first begins to work in peoples hearts his tendency is to bring them to a conviction of their absolute dependence on his sovereign power and grace he shows them their universal need for a mediator he does this by leading people more and more to a sense of their exceeding wickedness and guilt in his sight to a sense of their pollution and the insufficiency of their own righteousness he strives with them until they realize that they can in no way help themselves and that god would be wholly just and righteous in rejecting them and all that they do and in casting them off forever of course there is a vast variety as to the manner and distinctness of such convictions
661031 i have found that the sermons that have been most blessed are those concerning the doctrine of gods absolute sovereignty with regard to the salvation of sinners he is just and righteous in answering the prayers and ending the pains of natural men out of all the sermons i have offered to my congregation i never found one that could bring about the fruits of salvation as much as the words of romans 3 19 that every mouth may be stopped such a sermon attempts to show that it would be a just action on gods part to forever reject and cast off mere natural men
661032 show that at all times they ought to pray and not to lose heart
661033 the lord longs to be gracious to you and therefore he waits on high to have compassion on you
661034 cast all of our cares on him because he cares for you

661038 our adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour
661039 since you had posted the main points from my message i did want to elaborate a bit on the fourth point i didnt say much on it because i know that there have been several good messages given over the years on that very topic but looking back i wish i had said a bit more than i did i especially wish that i would have pointed out that each prayer that we pray is meaningful and is a step towards the answer in other words if we pray 99 times for something and then that prayer is answered after the 100th time it doesnt mean that those previous 99 requests were pointless god really does take note of all of our requests and each one is a step towards the giving of the answer if you think of a rope tied to a box full of gold i cant think of anything better on top of a building each tug on the rope brings that box a little closer to the edge its not just the final tug that brings the box down that is meaningful but all of the previous tugs were real and necessary steps towards the goal the same is true of prayer and is one of the reasons why perseverance in prayer is necessary in addition the lord will sometimes give partial answers to prayers that we are persevering in these are meant to encourage us to keep pressing on to the granting of the full request oftentimes we have a tendency to quit at the partial answer when god doesnt mean for that to happen he gives the partial answer to encourage us to press on to the full answer think of elijah praying for rain what would have happened if he had stopped when he saw that cloud the size of his hand nothing would have happened no rain would have come the cloud was only a partial answer and elijah persevered on until the full answer was given anyway since i stumbled on the site i thought i would share those brief thoughts
661040 o lord why does your anger burn against your people whom you have brought out from the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand why should the egyptians speak saying with evil intent he brought them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth

661062 high profile directors and ceos meanwhile had approached mr flaherty personally to express their concerns many felt they were being pressed into trusts because of their duty to maximize shareholder value despite their misgivings about the structure paul desmarais jr the well connected chairman of power corp of canada even railed against trusts in a conversation with prime minister stephen harper during a trip to mexico and told him he should act quickly to stop the raft of conversions according to sources
661063 what i find troublesome quite frankly is that i have ceos of banks and leaders on bay street who have said to me privately absolutely it was the right thing to do but they dont go out publicly and say the same thing
661064 it was not that we would have no taxes for foreign investors
661065 was not that we would have no taxes for telus it was not that we would have no taxes for bce it was not that we would have no taxes for foreign investors or no taxes for major corporations it was a commitment to protect the income of seniors
661066 stop the liberal attack on retirement savings and preserve income trusts by not imposing any new taxes on them
661067 we were specifically dealing with seniors in our policy platform
661068 innocent canadians are suffering an economic bloodbath because they believed the prime minister
661069 he gave his word canadians acted on his word he then broke his word
661070 this flip flop by mr flaherty has made our markets a laughing stock
661071 there were no leaks no e mails there were no deals with friends on bay street
661072 there was confidentiality deliberation and the provision of certainty for capital markets in canada finally there was an effort to create fairness for individual taxpayers and their families
661073 in the long term its good public policy and i think stephen harper if anything has a reputation for making the tough choices and the correct policy decisions
661074 the financial times are changing and this was a large and growing fiscal problem and it was creating a fiscal black hole
661075 weve eliminated corporate funding for political parties and we dont think corporations should get away without paying their share and this is the problem

661105 my opponent tony strickland represents the ineffectual policies of the past as exemplified by the bush administration which is why the voters of the 19th district across the political spectrum are supportive of the change that i can bring to the state senate
661106 were delighted that my democrat and independent supporters are being joined by republicans from all areas of the district to bring strong representation back to the central coast the mood of the nation and our state indicates clearly that americans want to see a return of responsible government and sensible policies that will result in greater access to health care better public education and a strong economy
661107 as always i am humbled by the hard work of our incredible volunteer team and by the financial support i have received in this crucial race
661108 we have a long road ahead of us and my campaign will continue to work hard to win the support of the voters in this district

661437 to that end he spoke to several senior iraqi officials yesterday as they near the end of the legislative process both to offer encouragement and stress the importance of getting the law through the final stages of the legislative process
661438 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
661439 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq

661453 i feel kind of free now as though ive broken free of the chains that imprisoned me but people always say that love that can stand the 7 years test will last forever so im disappointed that we cant pass the test even though ive tried my best
661454 oh well the ball is in her court now and if after this she still chooses me maybe then we can last forever
661455 rika if you have anything you can look for me you know i will be your listening ears
661456 she will kill me for this if this is from aya hope not
661457 actually im part of the reason why she became like that
661458 its not your fault you didnt intend for it to happen it just somehow happened
661459 anyway if you want to drink just remember not to get as drunk as this

661496 its the ambition of every player to play in the champions league or the uefa cup which is why i came here
661497 i think weve been building towards the leeds game and the trip to saints as an indication of where we actually are in this competition weve passed one test against leeds but it should be an even bigger one against saints
661498 winning becomes a habit and weve been winning games without playing particularly well which is a good sign

661555 ho il grande piacere di comunicare ha spiegato cazzola come si legge sul sito della squadra che in queste ultime giornate ho raggiunto un accordo con il mio socio il geometra renzo menarini per cedere alla sua societa la cogei la quota in mio possesso vale a dire il 63 di aktiva

661558 quanto e avvenuto oggi e quanto di meglio potesse capitare perche il bologna rimane alla societa che gia ne deteneva il controllo
661559 la proprieta del bologna sara saldamente in mano alla famiglia menarini famiglia di imprenditori che e parte importante della nostra citta

661575 es penoso que esto suceda en el barrio que lleva el nombre de la ley madre pero en el que sin embargo lo que se observa es la anomia y un marco de situaci n de convivencia cada vez m s complicada
661576 las disputas entre estos grupos que pelean por el control de la zona hacen que el barrio est en constante ebullici n adem s hubo un herido de bala que nunca fue registrado en ning n hospital de la ciudad ni del conurbano
661577 esta causa es emblem tica porque pulveriza de manera contundente la infame teor a de los dos demonios habida cuenta de que era un senador provincial sin antecedentes penales profesor universitario sin participaci n en ninguna facci n beligerante durante esos a os
661578 el nico pecado de mi padre fue oponerse al golpe de estado del 24 de marzo de 1976 y haber llevado adelante una investigaci n desde una comisi n legislativa por irregularidades en la polic a provincial que luego fue amparada impunemente por el gobierno de facto de antonio bussi
661579 dif cilmente alg n defensor de los represores pueda seguir sosteniendo en el futuro que entre 1976 y 1983 se vivi una guerra civil esto es una muestra de que el 24 de marzo de 1976 se inici una dictadura con objetivos pol ticos y econ micos adem s del exterminio de quienes se opon an al r gimen

661704 brain scan tests fail to support validity of esp research on parapsychology is largely taboo in academia but two harvard scientists recently set out to settle once and for all the age old question is extrasensory perception or esp real their sophisticated experiment answers no at least not as far as they can tell using high tech brain scanners to detect neural evidence of it

661712 por el tiempo y por la capacidad operativa no era posible abarcar el c rculo completo entonces se deten a al sujeto que estaba vendiendo en la calle y pasaba a control de detenci n no lleg bamos al financista o al laboratorio clandestino de la m sica ni a la imprenta clandestina
661713 en el caso de la primera operaci n de libros que hicimos en la que incautamos 82 mil ejemplares el principal imputado era un ex empleado de una importante editorial en ese caso l ten a mucho conocimiento del comercio del libro de hecho ocupaba dos casas pareadas una de ellas s lo para almacenar ejemplares destinados a provincia sin embargo aparte de este caso no hemos detectado un nexo entre imprentas clandestinas y editoriales
661714 hab a autores best seller como coelho isabel allende y marcela serrano sin embargo el grueso era lectura escolar complementaria lo que nos llam la atenci n a nosotros y a los expertos de las editoriales era la calidad de los libros que era muy buena era muy dif cil distinguir un pirata de un original en este caso el imputado llevaba alrededor de seis meses ejerciendo el comercio ilegal
661715 seguramente otra unidad policial detect una imprenta que imprim a pirater a formalmente de d a y de noche claro que debe haber muchas m s estamos trabajando en eso
661716 casi dos millones de d lares en el valor del precio de los libros originales
661717 no necesariamente por eso el trabajo es m s complejo que incautar lo que est en las calles o en los persas hay que buscar al distribuidor en el lugar donde se acopian existen librer as establecidas que adem s de originales comercializan libros falsificados y los distribuyen
661718 la ley se ala que deben ser destinados al autor que es contactado a trav s del archivo nacional nosotros no podemos donarlo hemos recibido muchos llamados de directores de colegios de provincia pidi ndonos donar estos libros pero por ley no podemos hacerlo ser a como legitimar el pirateo
661719 establecimos que los impresores de libros piratas iban a las librer as a ofrecer libros en mochilas para evitar ser sorprendidos en la v a p blica con una caja grande pero se estableci que los due os de algunas librer as del centro ninguna connotada que venden estos textos contactaban a los ambulantes no es que los ambulantes vayan a la imprenta sino que van a las librer as peque as
661720 en pleno centro las calles santo domingo catedral san diego en provincia es lo mismo es el ambulante el que va a buscar los libros falsificados a determinadas librer as no a al imprenta venden en promedio a 1 500 pesos cuando el precio promedio de los originales es de 6 mil pesos
661721 los ambulantes que venden pirater a en la calle est n coludidos con los delincuentes incluso los defienden cuando la polic a detiene a alguno
661722 lamentablemente aqu en la pirater a tambi n se ocupan menores de edad hay familias enteras que se dedican a la pirater a

661784 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
661785 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
661786 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
661787 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
661788 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
661789 i just want to try and freshen up the mind and get back to playing as a batsman i do believe these could be the best years of my playing career
661790 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket
661791 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game
661792 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
661793 the last thing i want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the team which is why ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration
661794 and telling them that multiplication is repeated addition definitely requires undoing later how much later as soon as the child progresses from whole number multiplication to multiplication by fractions or arbitrary real numbers at that point you have to tell a different story oh so multiplication of fractions is a different kind of multiplication is it a bright kid will say wondering how many more times you are going to switch the rules
661795 multiplication of natural numbers certainly gives the same result as repeated addition but that does not make it the same telling students falsehoods
661796 i can extend integer multiplication to these other kinds of numbers

661801 keith devlin has posted a follow up article its still not repeated addition
661802 what worried me that it was okay to tell students something that is totally and utterly false
661803 as far as his system view argument which is new to his argument and not really presented in the original article well very nice but it is just a view
661804 why not say that there are at least two basic things you can do to numbers you can add them and you can multiply them
661805 and if there is a method for teaching multiplication which will extend to real numbers then we should pay attention to it
661806 i would like to see this discussion move beyond negative reactions to how a person expresses himself
661807 just give me the facts so i can get this over with
661808 an infinite set of ordered things each with a successor
661809 7 6 hm 6 7 hm 5 7 is 35 and one more 7 makes 42
661810 8 apples in this basket 8 apples in this basket 8 apples in this basket and 8 apples in this basket
661811 gives you a super quick way to calculate a repeated addition sum
661812 behaves precisely the same in absolutely every imaginable context as
661813 teachers please dont take dr devlins advice we have far greater problems with education than k through 12 teachers not falling in line with overly pedantic mathematical dogma
661814 joe i dont see how you can say addition and multiplication are the same function
661815 we shouldnt teach anything to students which contradicts the way things really are by which he means the axiomatic presentation of fields integral domains and so on
661816 riding my bicycle gets me to my office in about the same time as taking my car but the two processes are very different
661817 this expansion extension is an inclusive one in that we are not denying what we have previously done
661818 sorry mathematics is not a matter of opinons its either right or wrong and multiplication is not repeated addition on any domain
661819 please make it a mathematical proof not a sidestep a semantic quibble an appeal to some authority or a stamp the foot insistence
661820 however the multiplication of any two integers can always be reduced or thought of or defined by repeated addition
661821 a basket contains 3 apples 4 oranges and 10 walnuts how many items are in the basket
661822 how many groups can we make out of this number of blocks
661823 you cant subtract a larger number from a smaller number
661824 you simply cant escape the fact that multiplication and repeated addition are different operations that they get the same results in the natural numbers is not at issue
661825 but of course when rational numbers are allowed it can be solved it can even be done by a student whose only understanding of multiplication was repeated addition as my own son did to my surprise with a similar puzzle when he was 5yo
661826 for every element of the domain the functions a and b have the same functional values
661827 1 5 without repeated addition or better yet admit defeat at least to yourself and have the dignity to bow out stop trying to call bullshit on something that has been more than amply demonstrated by now
661828 the only thing he seemed to care about was that the two
661829 the axiom of extensionality can be applied to functions as follows
661830 hanggadamai merasa bukan seleb blog apa rumus yang dipakai mas hanggadamai sehingga tiap postingan selalu kebanjiran komentar
661831 i think magicians and cognitive neuroscientists are getting at similar questions but while neuroscientists have been looking at this for a few decades magicians have been looking at this for centuries millennia probably
661832 what magicians do is light years ahead in terms of sophistication and the power of these techniques
661833 our picture of the world is kind of a virtual reality
661834 we tend to take the things that make us smart as human beings and turn those against us
661835 i use them when im actually coming out of the pocket
661836 most people dont understand the extent to which talking on a cellphone affects their driving
661837 the fundamental thing we do every day is ascertain what is reality its this diagnosis of what the signals coming into our eyes are supposed to mean
661838 we say thats a fence i must not walk into it or is that a car coming around the corner
661839 that the best way to grasp the power of deception is to do it themselves
661840 the longer i live the more i realize the impact of attitude on life attitude to me is more important than facts it is more important than the past than education than money than circumstances than failure than success than what other people think say or do it is the more important than appearance giftedness or skill it will make or break a company a church a home the remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day we cannot change our past we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way we cannot change the inevitable the only thing we can do is play on the one string we have and that is our attitude i am convinced that life is 10 what happens to me and 90 of how i react to it and so it is wit you we are in charge of our attitudes
661841 do what you love and youll never have to work a day in your whole life
661842 kivisto was a good trader someone who drew the differentials between say a barrel of gulf oil or midwestern crude
661843 the new york mercantile exchange is a tough fast place and traders there quickly figure out who knows what theyre doing and who doesnt being the old athlete as tom was he enjoyed that its competitive its eat or be eaten the pressure was so enormous
661844 he could help the producers become more transparent with what crude oil was worth by the barrel
661845 he was extraordinarily well spoken and very bright very open and very trustworthy
661846 he has been in very high demand to speak to energy groups legislators and any group interested in the pricing of energy he also has a high degree of integrity and vision and obviously he is experiencing some terrible problems
661847 i hope he can get through it and emerge in a new direction that is both good for him and for tulsa he means a lot to this community and we dont want to lose him
661848 he was competitively jazzed in his experiences in oil trading and he also lamented that koch was getting away from buying oil directly from the well operators
661849 the culture has always been great from the perspective of young up and coming wonderful people
661850 he told us no matter what happens in your personal lives i want you all to have a wonderful atmosphere to come to work to
661851 there were others that have tried to wield certain power and intimidation that would leave certain people with a sting you need to be looking at the top but not the person thats been in the media
661852 tom and his wife julie really care about the community and the company he has always been a straight up person tom was always easy to negotiate with he is a prince of a man a down to earth guy
661853 its another amazing part of an amazing story how did all of them get here how did it go unchecked for so long
661854 he was extraordinarily well spoken and very bright very open and very trustworthy

661858 for vehicles that may be propelled by both a clean burning fuel and any other fuel your deduction is generally the additional cost of permitting the use of the clean burning fuel
661859 deduction limit the maximum deduction you can claim for qualified clean fuel vehicle property with respect to any motor vehicle is one of the following 1 50 000 for a truck or van with a gross vehicle weight rating over 26 000 pounds or for a bus with a seating capacity of at least 20 adults excluding the driver 2 5 000 for a truck or van with a gross vehicle weight rating over 10 000 pounds but not more than 26 000 pounds 3 2 000 for a vehicle not included in 1 or 2
661860 my favourite way to prepare it is to grill a large steak in one piece until rare or medium rare let it rest then slice thinly across the grain to serve
661861 so we have everything from the loin to the shoulder cut to the round cut
661862 if youre starting off with a good quality cut of meat just let the flavour of the meat shine
661863 drilling off our coasts would have no significant impact on gasoline prices not in the short term not in the long term not ever
661864 the last thing coach rick pitino told us was dont foul
661865 i get reminded about it all the time especially since i live in kentucky
661866 ive never watched the game and i dont think about it but during march madness its impossible to ignore the shot always seems to get replayed during the tournament ill get ribbed about it and people will want to talk about it all over again
661867 i liked mike a lot but thought it would be prudent to have the situation fully resolved before we move forward
661868 the ncaa did not think it was necessary to go the route of banning him from coaching i talked to a lot of people in the ncaa about it i talked with mike extensively about it in fact i know he was tired of talking about it hes been out of coaching for five years and i think hes learned his lessons he will come back stronger
661869 i enjoyed working the games for espn much more than the studio work because it was the closest thing to coaching
661870 i missed it more than i thought i missed the competition i missed traveling with the team i missed being in the locker room after wins and even after losses that forces you to come to grips with reality
661871 so you can say the good news is that we have a lot of guys coming back or the bad news is we have a lot of guys coming back im hoping its the first part
661872 once i talked with jarvis i told him i was pulling out
661873 he was easy to talk to hes a down to earth guy he said hes going to help me be a better player and help our team achieve our goals
661874 hes got a chance to be a very special leader
661875 there was no winning tradition there they hadnt made the ncaa tournament since the jfk era there wasnt a strong fan base or a lot of funding
661876 we could have just plugged in the next best xs and os guy but our program is in such a fragile existence
661877 we are fighting for a fan base and looking to promote our program
661878 mike was the best fit of anyone to manage all those things hes part of a church with 7 000 members and a lot of those people were endorsing him hes firmly entrenched in this community he lives in a very nice neighborhood here and has built up a network here
661879 its unrealistic to expect a guy to camp out here for the rest of his career
661880 but obviously we would prefer to get three or four years out of someone mainly we wanted someone with a lot of hunger we really think mike has a chip on his shoulder to get on back on top and to go out on his terms he has a fire in his belly
661881 hes going to have to be very careful not to bow to public pressure and not bow to emotion
661882 many american hospitals are taking it upon themselves to repatriate seriously injured or ill immigrants because they cannot find nursing homes willing to accept them without insurance medicaid does not cover long term care for illegal immigrants or for newly arrived legal immigrants creating a quandary for hospitals which are obligated by federal regulation to arrange post hospital care for patients who need it american immigration authorities play no role in these private repatriations carried out by ambulance air ambulance and commercial plane most hospitals say that they do not conduct cross border transfers until patients are medically stable and that they arrange to deliver them into a physicians care in their homeland but the hospitals are operating in a void without governmental assistance or oversight leaving ample room for legal and ethical transgressions on both sides of the border
661883 i am always working on improving my presentation skills as a member of the pmi i am often required to give speeches at my chapter which i find very helpful in refining these skills
661884 with five years experience working in the financial services industry and my proven track record of saving the company money i could make a big difference in your company im confident i would be a great addition to your team

662043 nou doe je het w r h vertrouw je me niet of zo ik zeg toch dat die weg gewoon nog begaanbaar is waarom luister je dan niet waarom flikker je me niet meteen in de container als je t ch niet naar me luistert
662044 niks nou ja zeg ik zeg heel duidelijk dat jij rechtsaf moet omdat je anders verkeerd rijdt en wat doet meneer zeiken over een duidelijk niet opgebroken weg en rechtdoor gaan nou dan zoek je het maar zelf uit ook
662045 doe niet zo raar zeg zeg me gewoon waar ik heen moet nu

662047 wilde je soms ongelukken krijgen of zo moet ik de auto maar zelf laten keren of zo want vergeet niet dat ik verkeer ook niet zie voor mij is de weg altijd keurig leeg
662048 jij kunt het niet maken om niet naar me te luisteren ik weet hier de weg jij niet dus jij zult precies doen wat ik zeg meneer dus nu keer je heel snel om en ga je vervolgens linksaf die weg in

662075 pflicht jetzt das tibetische volk das sein kulturelles berleben verteidigt nicht zu vergessen

662078 ive had no work for a year doors have been closed and im still on antidepressants and living on benefits i wasnt made fully aware of the potential pitfalls beforehand and i know the others werent either
662079 i am a dead man walking this is my last curtain call i came here to die
662080 i asked to leave and they said no i was under pressure but they didnt step in to help they dont care if youre suffering as long as you have a personality and can help them boost ratings and callers to prime rate phone numbers
662081 i know its like david v goliath but i am very focused and bosses should be worried
662082 the welfare of all housemates is important to us robust procedures are in place to ensure a high level of care for housemates prior to during and on leaving we have not been contacted by shahbaz saying he is now dissatisfied
662083 they were returning from the summit when an avalanche at the bottleneck hit them
662084 our liason officer at the base camp confirmed the death of five
662085 we dont have names of dead climbers but it has been confirmed that one dutch one norwegian and one french are in the tally of dead
662086 according to the rumors from the various expeditions at the base camp there should be nine people dead and four still missing
662087 we were told that some climbers are still returning to the camps
662088 were still discussing the possibilities of an operation because the altitude where the accident occurred is very high
662089 we can take a helicopter up there to drop medicines and supplies but carrying out any operation is very difficult
662090 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
662091 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
662092 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
662093 he told me he had proposed several times but she kept telling him she wanted to give their relationship more time

662103 i think we will see banks non banks and credit unions come up with different products to try to meet that 5 down payment
662104 the vast majority of people who take 40 year amortizations actually qualify for 25 year amortizations but choose the former and accelerate their payments which reduce their amortization to 32 years registering their mortgage with a 40 year amortization helps protect them in the future should they need to decrease their payment
662105 qualifying for a mortgage and being able to afford the cost of home ownership are two different animals
662106 lowering your amortization from 40 years will save you a serious amount on interest over the years just going from 40 years down to 35 on a 250 000 mortgage could save you close to 50 000 assuming a 5 per cent interest rate

662115 when i wake up the only wreath in the house is one of cigarette and marijuana smoke that lazily curls around the naked bulb in the ceiling of our studio apartment
662116 i grew up accepting the inevitability that once you became a woman you were always on a diet being a woman equaled loss as i reached for a bright orange cosmopolitan with an equally orange jessica simpson on the cover i wondered what was i about to give up and what i would eventually gain
662117 getting him to open up or how to interview a brick wall

662281 too many people were restoring otherwise well preserved original cars when they should have been leaving them alone
662282 a profound and irreversible change on it and severs its connection with history
662283 automobiles are made up of disparate materials that often dont live happily together
662284 add to that the fact that they are technological objects that are subject to use and abuse that other collectible objects are not and sometimes the owner is left with little choice but to attempt some form of intervention

662326 its extremely exciting i cant believe its taken this long but ive already started putting the set list together and there are so many songs to play i have been inspired by some intimate shows i have done recently here and internationally and by playing theatres i can be closer to all the people who have taken my record home
662327 you dont feel that connection when people take your albums home theres
662328 i would have liked to tour earlier but im just glad i can finally mtell people the dates when they ask me when im touring next there are lots of songs from over the years people know to sing along with and im going to do some fun covers but i dont want to spoil the surprise
662329 at hoje n o deram nenhuma explica o e tamb m n o resolveram a encosta
662330 when i got back the albums first mix i was in tears because it was the kind of music i wanted to make it was familiar yet modern
662331 the whole thing was a trip im still figuring out how i want to write about it and talk about the last few days that were so amazing i had an extraordinary tour you share experiences with other artists that is almost unfathomable it was about bringing people together and empowering them and making them feel good about themselves it was an amazing time in vancouver i had to stop the show and say excuse me excuse me do you realize what were doing it was like oh my god we are doing this together i hope people feel empowered about it and they got the information they need to achieve what they needed in their life
662332 i was inspired by their humour by their sensitivity by what they wrote about by their energy by tegans zest for her work and her life and the way she looked at things also just the passion for their own work is inspiring i must say that it also changes your own perspective on yourself
662333 unfortunately sometimes ill look on youtube and think oh my god why did i think that looked good why did i wear that so i cant really look at myself and live in the moment and let it go because youll never be who you think you are in your mind in your mind youre much taller laughs and your hair is long and flowing you look completely different
662334 i had done two special projects at last and body acoustic which were great to do but i wanted to get back to making my regular work again and writing
662335 i always love working in a community of artists its always a petrie dish it doesnt always come out the way you like but this one did when i got back the first mix of high and mighty i was in tears because it was the kind of music i wanted to make it was familiar yet modern
662336 i tried not to make every vocal the same i tried to find the character of the story teller i especially loved in raging storm to sing in octaves in one song and the low octave in the next song lay me down it had intrigued me to bend over backwards to find these different characters it was tricky it was like a big old puzzle but we got it together
662337 i was taking pictures like that because at a certain time in history as women we were sold a bill of goods
662338 but this woman in the picture is still holding onto her disco ball her joy shes still having a party wherever she goes and shes going to keep her joy no matter what i thought using props like gnomes and the disco ball and the broom were pretty funny
662339 it was only once we started talking about the idea that it sank in how many singles theres been from what about me right through to loud and in pieces all these songs mean so much to me and showcase a journey that ive been through with my songwriting and recording my career in general its great to have the new songs on the album as they are just a taste of what weve got planned for next year
662340 this is a wonderful charity i am so proud to be part of bringing joy and hope
662341 we are delighted and pleased to have two such exciting artists as jack and alicia who were inspired by our film to join together their extraordinary talents in creating a unique sound for quantum of solace

662423 we have the speed in the race but if i cant get qualifying right then we will always end up like this
662424 we just need to sort out the problems and then we will be fighting for wins
662425 unfortunately we needed to back off we were much faster like with alonso but it is so difficult
662426 it is very difficult to get past you need something special in one corner

662485 we have been in a position to fight for a victory but always something has gone wrong and hasnt functioned correctly today lewis and massa were fastest in race i tried to put pressure on massa hoping he had would have a mechanical failure and it seemed to work
662486 the team went through difficult times but i kept pushing and i am extremely happy to score my first victory
662487 i was catching him quite a big chunk every lap to put pressure on him i did everything to put pressure on him and my car felt particularly good during the last stint
662488 the first two stints i was cautious because at some races i had problems with tyre degradation so i knew if i passed that edge i might struggle
662489 i think we could have done the race a little bit better but we were stuck behind alonso
662490 i was stuck behind him until the second stop so it was a bit late by that point i had a good car and i was able to catch timo but i had to back off in one moment
662491 we were a bit lucky with some of the other guys we have the speed but if we cannot get qualifying then we will have the same problems we have to sort it out
662492 if we can be in front we can fight for wins the guys did a good job but we need to fix the problems and for sure we can be back in the hunt for wins
662493 unfortunately we needed to back off we were much faster like with alonso but it is so difficult it is very difficult to get past you need something special in one corner unfortunately i could not pass him third place in the end after a difficult weekend for me was a good result
662494 i could not believe it when i saw felipes engine go and i was p2 i was under pressure from kimi with soft tyres and i was struggling quite a lot we knew since friday that the soft tyres would be difficult

662500 the concentrated epidemic approach reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the social networks of blacks in america we are experiencing an epidemic with significant transmission beyond vulnerable populations nothing short of a mass black mobilization will be sufficient to turn around the aids epidemic in black america
662501 the u s should understand from its work in countries with similar epidemiological profiles that a more effective approach for black america would include a mix of targeted programs for high risk populations broad based initiatives that mobilize entire communities and efforts to address the role of concurrent partnerships and the rapid spread of hiv transmission in social networks
662502 black women are particularly affected by the domestic aids response and attention to their needs are inadequate lives are lost as a result
662503 as in other parts of the world black women in the u s often face increased vulnerability to hiv due to lack of a perception of power in sexual relationships and low self esteem many cannot insist on abstinence or the use of condoms because of fear of emotional or physical abuse by their partners development of female initiated prevention methods is not only a critical priority for black women overseas but also for black women here at home
662504 among men who have sex with men worldwide blacks in the u s may have the highest hiv prevalence in the u s black gay men experience more than twice the rate of infection as their white counterparts
662505 black men who have sex with men in the u s share important attributes related to hiv risk with their peers in other regions including the experience of severe stigma and discrimination that often impedes hiv prevention efforts amp

662524 a couple of things would ring a bell with people
662525 i follow with deep friendship this great sporting event the most important and awaited on a world level and i wish that it offer the international community a valid example of coexistence among people of different background in the respect of common dignity
662526 each can give their best in the true olympic spirit
662527 to go back into my past and at the same time walk toward the future
662528 there is actually a lot of work out there we constantly get calls from companies and people asking us do you have new comedians do you have people to recommend for a d amp d or a company event i think there is a lot of work out there to be gotten
662529 in singapore we are like a third world country in term of the entertainment the good ones are very successful the not so good ones are its improving
662530 sometimes you still have to fall back on the sexual innuendos the singapore audience likes a bit of that they like a bit of crass a bit of sarcasm sarcasm i think works throughout singapore in whatever form
662531 generally i think what singaporeans feel comfortable with is something with a very local flavour they like it when theres someone up there speaking their lingo who knows their problems and their trials and tribulations
662532 being funny is observing everyday life and trying to bring out the truth about what is happening and people like to see the truth for example if you make a joke about the coe certificate of entitlement for vehicles people laugh about it because it so true
662533 for me its come to a stage where its kinda the same you go up there and have a persona you need a personality and when that comes across for me it really doesnt matter funny is funny
662534 ive grown to realise that my style is i dont get it why like that huh you create your own character after a while im not smart and people dont expect me to be
662535 a man as a man can be funny a woman as a woman can be funny a woman acting as a man not so funny but a man acting as a woman is usually very very funny so too bad women
662536 people are more sophisticated than you think they are theyve been made to laugh many times already and youre one more person out there you really need to find that hook to get through to your audience
662537 i enjoy making people laugh a lot i love watching people roll on the floor to me that is the satisfaction it is really a god send career making people laugh enjoying what you do and getting paid a lot of money for that

662543 former service station sites fuel farms garages workshops gasometers oil spills dry cleaners and factories which used or processed hydrocarbons or explosives are literally everywhere that has been closely settled for the past century or so
662544 it seems like we are going to put him on diet
662545 at last someone whos not just posting to promote themselves
662546 i had to spend fifteen minutes and a jumbo packet of schitoff cleaning up after your last visit now what do you want
662547 no i just mean that she found a way of passing matter through matter without molesting either
662548 if your theory is correct and its one that i find most attractive rather like yourself despite your tail i wonder if we might find evidence of it in the stinging nettle patch that lies just behind this freezer
662549 but havent the police gone over everywhere with a fine tooth comb already
662550 they went over it with size twelve boots the worthless scum all evidence will have been crushed beneath them
662551 what fabulous fun she must be having teleporting herself all over the place like that
662552 i shall join the fight against the oppression unfairness and general ghastliness that i have discovered in this foul land of prannick the wheel is absolutely rotten i dont like it its exponents are total bastards who deserve to either die horribly or get sent to some putrid place of slime and unpleasantness where their fingernails will crack and their reproductive organs will atrophy into uselessness
662553 i just overheard two passing wood mice talking about a stix meeting being held in some place called kinell if cavies get to vote im raising my paw to the suggestion that we get our bored asses outta here
662554 theyre built on opposite banks of the turgid river did they mention which kinell
662555 now how the hell am i supposed to know that
662556 its more than three hop skip and jumps to the woodland track i could barely make out a word of what they said are they north and south or east and west
662557 those sure are dumb names i guess he musta been talkin bout far kinell yeah the stix meetings in far kinell
662558 i know of a short cut there via 96 and old drainage pipe if we move muy r pido we can arrive before the caf con leche and buttered scones are shared out during the intermission
662559 i havent enjoyed the texture of a buttered scone since nanny used one to placate me that time when she was forced to smear an unpleasant balm upon my chafed privates after id indulged in some tactile experimentation inside a chain mail jerkin but lets not get into that right now if its stix time then im ready to do my bit and let no rodent dare stand in my way
662560 oh how i curse those ancient drainage pipe builders for making them so small and regard my brass helmet everyone its got all scratched by the low ceiling
662561 some will tell you that the wheel brings peace and prosperity to prannick that as a direct result of its rule we have equality for all rodents but is this true
662562 it was a rhetorical question flossy we all know the answer to it its no
662563 since youre so keen to slag off the wheel in public what you had to say about what they say about our chattels its a reasonable enough question though perhaps not particularly pertinent
662564 youre bloody right it aint pertinent ya daft old bastard
662565 were supposed to be rabble rousing not having a reasonable discussion concerning the merits of the autocracy that rules us with an iron paw now shut up or go fluff yourself
662566 a hamster after my own heart i like this fellow though not in a sexual sort of way of course
662567 i say i think ive seen this fellow nosing about in the market place 99 does anyone know who he is
662568 listen to him calling me a twerp thats a sure sign of a law master spy i reckon lets hang him up from the nearest rhubarb tree by his scrotum
662569 what and countenance the actions of the wheel we are stix sir we desire nothing more than justice throughout our realm only logic and honest evidence shall convict you
662570 its the forces of the wheel run run for your lives
662571 bring all the known stix to me the rest take them to far kinell town hall incarcerate them with inconsolable misery make their 102 bindings hurt or take away their chairs that sort of thing i want them all to suffer in some form or other empty the snack bar and douse the fire in the range make it all nasty and smoky for them yes and have the toilets blocked too let them wallow in their own filth
662572 fundamentally the issue matrix from 2006 to 2008 has shifted completely steve kagen now is a member of the status quo a member of congress and has refused to allow drilling
662573 the only group of people on the planet who are blocking us from opening up drilling and exploration
662574 its the other legislators who are the dogs that seems to work frankly
662575 trust your heart even when it leads you off the beaten path
662576 youve got to find what you love do what you believe is great work dont settle

662578 apolo you just lost the gold medal how do you feel
662579 rep wood has proven to be an independent vote in the assembly in the time i have known him i have gained a lot of respect for him i hope his district will support him in his bid for re election
662580 imagine joe sixpack going from one committee meeting to another or cheerfully going through the multitude of constituent photo ops and mail picture joe running from one evening reception to another keeping up with all the constituent requests while keeping all of his staff family and constituents happy
662581 visualize a member of congress at home working nine to five in an office environment and then being able to go home and spend the evening with their family or enjoying time off with their friends
662582 the danger would be whether the member would ever come back to washington
662583 assuming we are spiritually fit we can do all sorts of things alcoholics are not supposed to do people have said we must not go where liquor is served we must not have it in our homes we must shun friends who drink we must avoid moving pictures which show drinking scenes we must not go into bars our friends must hide their bottles if we go to their houses we mustnt think or be reminded about alcohol at all our experience shows that this is not necessarily so we meet these conditions every day an alcoholic who cannot meet them still has an alcoholic mind there is something the matter with his spiritual status his only chance for sobriety would be some place like the greenland ice cap and even there an eskimo might turn up with a bottle of scotch and ruin everything
662584 we dont need to sit down we make up a game plan after weve started
662585 this is our first cross platform release using gstreamer as our new media core by default it handles all flac playback on windows mac or you can
662586 the biggest problem with surveying drunks is that alcohol seems to make some people think they are the funniest people on earth
662587 and that we the surveyors would be very interested in hearing all their really interesting stories
662588 judicial discretion is a cornerstone of our justice system but so is consistency transparency fairness and certainty these laws dont undermine the legal principles judges are required to follow in sentencing they merely require judges to be quite clear about what theyre doing
662589 i can say a plea of guilty has a mitigatory effect on sentence and can say it would have been a longer one but thats all i can sensibly say
662590 some of them just cant come to grips with the idea of someone telling them what to do or that the public is entitled to know exactly how they reach their decisions
662591 the brumby government has implemented a broad range of measures designed to combat alcohol related harm ranging from giving police and the director of liquor licensing more powers putting a freeze on any new late night liquor licences and providing more support to victorians experiencing problems with alcohol
662592 the current lockout trial will cease at the start of september an evaluation of its effectiveness will be completed the temporary lockout will cease before any future on going arrangements are put in place
662593 under the current situation there is little for the petrol commissioner to do other than to watch
662594 unless the government gives the commissioner additional powers the position can easily fall into disrepute
662595 the cancer is not life threatening christina is following the recommended treatment and will have a full recovery
662596 im really grateful that acting is the job that was chosen for me
662597 i get really lost when im not working thank god for dance class but acting is what i really have to do
662598 weve spent the day on the phone talking to our family in ireland and obviously our parents are devastated
662599 but we have been heartened and are grateful to so many strangers and friends in melbourne who have been helping us through this ordeal
662600 we cant believe the kindness we have been shown by so many people who have expressed concern for stephen
662601 its not just that he has blond hair and blue eyes and is good looking
662602 baz sat us down and said logan was very believable and had a big future in film he does not have a big part but it is a start
662603 he got very good money but we are not allowed to discuss it
662604 they gave us a big flat in bondi for two weeks and looked after us like kings
662605 how much we miss him we love him we want him
662606 we all wish that he would come back but he has given no indication that he would
662607 deep anxiety about his ability to govern for ordinary australians
662608 this was driven by the view that he was completely out of touch this flowed through to worries about what he would have done with workchoices particularly the view that he would have taken the laws further
662609 part of australias global standing lies in the fact that we have such an enormously competitive nation on the international field of sporting endeavour and the olympics and other elite sports as well
662610 her first words were she was very happy to see very nice people she was ecstatic
662611 the duty of state government is to serve and protect people our first job is making sure we are serving the public and are available to the public
662612 the state director of personnel is currently reviewing telecommuting policies with that goal in mind and we would consider any proposals for a four day week in the same vein
662613 but supervising such an arrangement would take a special level of skills and development of standards to avoid abuse of such a system
662614 we are ready at the last moment the u s is doing much worse than we had thought
662615 but the same goes also for citigroup and general motors and thereby starts a complete meltdown in the u s

662629 although the sales of whirlwind video games have declined over the past two years a recent survey of video game players suggests that this sales trend is about to be reversed the survey asked video game players what features they thought were most important in a video game according to the survey players prefer games that provide lifelike graphics which require the most up to date computers whirlwind has just introduced several such games with an extensive advertising campaign directed at people 10 to 25 years old the age group most likely to play video games it follows then that the sales of whirlwind video games are likely to increase dramatically in the next few months
662630 we suspect the role of a few illegal immigrants in the current case
662631 we are more concerned because they come from poor background and are willing to do anything for money
662632 but they keep coming back and living in ghettos they are better organised and well networked
662633 today there are three crore bangladeshis in india but the kashmiri hindus are forced to live as refugees in their own country they bangladeshis are allowed to live because they are muslims this is nothing but an apparent case of muslim appeasement
662634 they the activists of bajarang dal have been told that the police is verifying details about them the people of unauthorized habitat near the city and if they will be bangladeshis then we will deport them as we have instruction for to do so but our investigation reveals that many of them are native of assams barpeta region they the activists have done wrong therefore we have arrested them
662635 in a statement obama repeated three times he said what george bush and john mccain are going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills when he won the north carolina primary he said mccain would play on our fears and exploit our differences in june he said republicans were going to run against him saying hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black obama hopes to use the racism card to inhibit all criticism of him with the presumed cooperation of the press
662636 happening now john mccains campaigns levels a very serious allegation against barack obama
662637 tonight is obama just touchy after mccain accused him of sleeping with fidel castro
662638 scrapped plans to visit wounded members of the armed forces in germany as part of his overseas trip a decision his campaign said was made because the democratic presidential candidate thought it would be inappropriate on a campaign funded journey
662639 you should be thinking about how can your child become bilingual
662640 but at a time when polls show obama ahead of mccain by 16 points on the economy should mccain be staying closer to home
662641 so why is senator mccain abroad when americans are focused on the economy here at home and losing jobs more and more jobs as bianna just reported
662642 weve seen that over and over again so many want to know other than what you just said why are you in colombia this morning

662651 if there is a lot of sun it is quite hot the temperature difference between the body and the environment is small
662652 typically in such conditions you have more sunlight so the solar generator compensates for the low thermoelectric power
662653 using both power sources you get twice as much power so its roughly half the size
662654 the more portable and unobtrusive the system the more true to life the data will be
662655 if your body can provide the basic power then there are a myriad number of devices ranging from brain stimulation to glucose monitoring systems that become much more practical for long term continuous use

662771 obama is so humble that he doesnt feel the need to pretend not to be proud of his exquisite skill at self deprecation
662772 man cannot live without love he remains a being that is incomprehensible for himself his life is senseless if love is not revealed to him if he does not encounter love if he does not experience it and make it his own if he does not participate intimately in it
662773 when he disembarked and saw the vast crowd his heart was moved with pity for them and he cured their sick
662774 taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he said the blessing broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples who in turn gave them to the crowds
662775 the holy eucharist is the final link in the sacred chain of life giving nourishment reaching from the remoteness of god into the here and now of human existence
662776 the mode of christs presence under the eucharistic species is unique it raises the eucharist above all the sacraments as the perfection of the spiritual life and the end to which all the sacraments tend in the most blessed sacrament of the eucharist the body and blood together with the soul and divinity of our lord jesus christ and therefore the whole christ is truly really and substantially contained this presence is called real by which is not intended to exclude the other types of presence as of they could not be real too but because it is presence in the fullest sense that is to say it is a substantial presence by which christ god and man makes himself wholly and entirely present
662777 johann baptist metz once said that the formula today is no to god yes to religion people want to have some kind of religion esoteric or whatever it may be but a personal god who speaks to me who knows me personally who has said something quite specific and who has met me with a specific demand and who will also judge me people dont want him what we see is religion being separated from god people dont want to do without this sensation of the wholly other this special religious feeling entirely they want it available in many shapes and forms but there is in the end no guarantee of its continuing to be there unless the will of god and god himself are also present in that sense we are not so much in the middle of a religious crisis religions are springing up all over the place as in the middle of a god crisis
662778 all you who are thirsty come to the water you who have no money come receive grain and eat come without paying and without cost drink wine and milk why spend your money for what is not bread your wages for what fails to satisfy
662779 man cannot live without love he remains a being that is incomprehensible for himself his life is senseless if love is not revealed to him if he does not encounter love if he does not experience it and make it his own if he does not participate intimately in it
662780 it is highly fitting that christ should have wanted to remain present to his church in this unique way since christ was about to take his departure from his own in his visible form he wanted to give us his sacramental presence since he was about to offer himself on the cross to save us he wanted us to have the memorial of the love with which he loved us to the end even to the giving of his life in his eucharistic presence he remains mysteriously in our midst as the one who loved us and gave himself up for us and he remains under signs that express and communicate this love
662781 when i was arrested i had to leave immediately with empty hands the next day i was permitted to write to my people in order to ask for the most necessary things clothes toothpaste i wrote please send me a little wine as medicine for my stomachache the faithful understood right away they sent me a small bottle of wine for mass with a label that read medicine for stomachaches they also sent some hosts which they hid in a flashlight for protection against the humidity the police asked me you have stomachaches yes heres some medicine for you i will never be able to express my great joy every day with three drops of wine and a drop of water in the palm of my hand i would celebrate mass this was my altar and this was my cathedral it was true medicine for soul and body medicine of immortality remedy so as not to die but to have life always in jesus as st ignatius of antioch says each time i celebrate the mass i had the opportunity to extend my hands and nail myself to the cross with jesus to drink with him the bitter chalice each day in reciting the words of consecration i confirmed with all my heart and soul a new pact and eternal pact between jesus and me through his blood mixed with mine those were the most beautiful masses of my life

662797 i dont need an american flag lapel pin i have american flag shoulder pads
662798 believe me america when i tell you this is 10 inches
662799 i believe in god the father almighty creator of heaven and earth
662800 in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
662801 and reconciles and unites with himself those who turn away from sin
662802 mysteries that are hidden in god which can never be known unless they are revealed by god
662803 no one knows the son except the father and no one knows the father except the son and any one to whom the son chooses to reveal him
662804 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
662805 radiance of the glory of god and the very stamp of his nature
662806 the only begotten son of god eternally begotten of the father light from light true god from true god begotten not made consubstantial with the father
662807 we believe in the holy spirit the lord and giver of life who proceeds from the father
662808 the holy spirit the third person of the trinity is god one and equal with the father and the son of the same substance and also of the same nature yet he is not called the spirit of the father alone but the spirit of both the father and the son
662809 with the father and the son he is worshipped and glorified
662810 the holy spirit is eternally from father and son he has his nature and subsistence at once simul from the father and the son he proceeds eternally from both as from one principle and through one spiration and since the father has through generation given to the only begotten son everything that belongs to the father except being father the son has also eternally from the father from whom he is eternally born that the holy spirit proceeds from the son
662811 the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the fellowship of the holy spirit be with you all
662812 the father is that which the son is the son that which the father is the father and the son that which the holy spirit is i e by nature one god
662813 each of the persons is that supreme reality viz the divine substance essence or nature
662814 he is not the father who is the son nor is the son he who is the father nor is the holy spirit he who is the father or the son
662815 it is the father who generates the son who is begotten and the holy spirit who proceeds
662816 in the relational names of the persons the father is related to the son the son to the father and the holy spirit to both while they are called three persons in view of their relations we believe in one nature or substance
662817 everything in them is one where there is no opposition of relationship
662818 because of that unity the father is wholly in the son and wholly in the holy spirit the son is wholly in the father and wholly in the holy spirit the holy spirit is wholly in the father and wholly in the son
662819 grace which was given to us in christ jesus before the ages began
662820 the father the son and the holy spirit are not three principles of creation but one principle
662821 one god and father from whom all things are and one lord jesus christ through whom all things are and one holy spirit in whom all things are
662822 he will keep my word and my father will love him and we will come to him and make our home with him
662823 with the father and the son he is worshipped and glorified
662824 the holy spirit proceeds from the father as the first principle and by the eternal gift of this to the son from the communion of both the father and the son
662825 in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
662826 now this is the catholic faith we worship one god in the trinity and the trinity in unity without either confusing the persons or dividing the substance for the person of the father is one the sons is another the holy spirits another but the godhead of the father son and holy spirit is one their glory equal their majesty coeternal
662827 i believe in god the father almighty creator of heaven and earth
662828 it is always in your power to show great strength and who can withstand the strength of your arm
662829 you are merciful to all for you can do all things
662830 i will be a father to you and you shall be my sons and daughters says the lord almighty
662831 in god power essence will intellect wisdom and justice are all identical nothing therefore can be in gods power which could not be in his just will or his wise intellect
662832 the power of god and the wisdom of god for the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men
662833 the immeasurable greatness of his power in us who believe
662834 for he who is mighty has done great things for me and holy is his name
662835 nothing is more apt to confirm our faith and hope than holding it fixed in our minds that nothing is impossible with god once our reason has grasped the idea of gods almighty power it will easily and without any hesitation admit everything that the creed will afterwards propose for us to believe even if they be great and marvelous things far above the ordinary laws of nature
662836 i know that you can do all things and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted
662837 god you show your almighty power above all in your mercy and forgiveness
662838 because of this unity the father is entire in the son entire in the holy spirit the son is entire in the father entire in the holy spirit the holy spirit is entire in the father entire in the son

662846 ronald reagan had no foreign policy experience but according to republicans he was one of the most successful foreign policy presidents ever

662849 just trust us obama makes us feel good dont look at his resume

662938 i think too much is being made even before the film has been released let public watch the film and react and then we will see
662939 the members have reviewed the film and come to the conclusion that the matter should be left to the public to decide raking up unnecessary controversy should be avoided the filmmaker vipul shah had assured us that there will be no negative portrayal of sikhs in the film
662940 therefore we should not straightaway start making hue and cry
662941 we exclude continuous heavy rains before and on the day of the opening ceremony however we dont exclude that on the 8th of august there might be periodic rain
662942 i had the privilege to reside in the olympic village since the 1968 mexico games and i never saw a village like this it is outstanding
662943 even if there is a shower during the opening ceremony the current technology can guarantee that the fireworks effect will not be affected
662944 we will release typhoon prediction and pre warning 36 hours or 24 hours in advance

662982 you pay first at fast food restaurants because if they let people pay at the end after you ate the food no one would pay for this junk
662983 that two weeks has got to be looked at from the point of view that they did take a four or five day break to go and consult
662984 we would like to see the speedy conclusion of the talks and successful outcome so that we can focus in the future our attention around our economy
662985 i think i did the best of the worst if you like in the end
662986 i had no idea about the puncture and the team did a great job to help me back into that race and last year i think i lost the championship because of punctures
662987 but congratulations to heikki who drove a great race and he deserves his win we have taken points from our rivals today and made the best of things it could have been a whole lot worse
662988 i havent stepped back and watched that video too many times or sat back and thought of myself as the fastest man i know if i stop and think about that they are going to catch up
662989 and youve got to be purely focused on yourself not watching other people behind the blocks or swimming other peoples races
662990 even when i play playstation i like to beat people and like to get better and ill sit in front of that until i perfect something and i guess thats what ive tried to do with my racing and swimming im never satisfied with staying in the same place
662991 i think ive done the work to improve again and weve got the race plan intact to suggest i can swim fast but you never know whats going to happen
662992 as long as i put my race plan together on the day and swim my race the way i want to i think theres going to be improvements
662993 coming into this one olympics having one in the bag is going to help with distractions
662994 if it was my first team and swimming all these events 50m and 100m freestyle and two relays and being favourite for the 50m and going into a village where its such a big stimulus to take in and there are so many things happening its quite distracting this time im very prepared for it and know what to expect
662995 its weird to think i was 17 at my first olympics and went in there to have fun and see how i went and i suppose i have a lot more confidence now than i did four years ago
662996 i dont see it as pressure i just want to do well for myself
662997 i always wanted to be butterfly champion susie oneill i remember watching her when i was who knows how old and i wanted to be exactly like her she was winning gold medals and i wanted to be exactly like her so yeah i dreamed about winning gold medals too

663000 we wanted lost tunes to replicate the experience of going to a favorite local record shop where browsing and discovering music is a real pleasure and an adventure we only include music that we love
663001 its looking better and better every day but were going to decide on monday
663002 were working as best we can to be ready if i can get some good days training between now and beijing without any more problems ill be ok
663003 theres a possibility that that time trial spot will be there for him but theres a lot to happen between now and making that decision
663004 we want to see if im good enough to get on the plane first and then well see after that
663005 i dont know whats going through his mind but hes here ready to go in case im not
663006 im a bit sick of being in the limelight to be honest im tired of all the attention
663007 when you go to the tour as a contender for a top 10 or something you sort of quietly tap away at your work
663008 but when youre there in the yellow jersey and fighting for the win its a completely different story and everyone wants to take a photo every time you sneeze or whatever and it can be a bit tiring sometimes
663009 it the lineout effort is not one that we will reflect on with a lot of pride
663010 a bit of a reality check might be good for the guys
663011 it will make us work even though the work ethic is already very good with this team it just reinforces how tough it is to win away from home and we need that heading to south africa
663012 but we know were only at the half way mark of the tri nations and you dont have time to dwell on any losses you just look at the kiwis a week is a long time and you can turn things around quickly
663013 not starting well hurt us in the end but when we scored just before half time we got that confidence back we were then telling each other we were right back in the match we felt if we played smart and got down there we were a chance by trying to build the points however the all blacks kept dominating field position and it was hard to really attack
663014 pinning us down in our own half whereas last week we were able to turn those high kicks and dominate field position a bit more
663015 i still feel we had the right game plan to beat the all blacks but we just werent able to execute it
663016 some of their kicking was contestable and they werent even that effective but we werent accurate in securing it
663017 the bounce went their way they built momentum and field position
663018 its a real learning curve obviously were still a little way off the mark
663019 its there when we were under pressure a bit in the first half we lost our way a bit in the big games when finals come around we want to be better when were under the pump
663020 we scored 34 points but that was on the back of our defence we frustrated them a bit
663021 we know what works and what doesnt we just want to finetune it so when the big games come around weve got a game which were all confident in if your games not right you get torn apart and get beaten
663022 nothing has been said directly but you get hints thats what they the raiders think the pressure to perform its relieved a little bit now ive got it for the rest of the year
663023 id rather be in it the top eight than out but the last five or six rounds have been like this for a few years now since the competition became more even
663024 you can have a big rise on the ladder if you get a good win and one or two other results go your way but you can also have just as big a fall if you lose and results go against you
663025 its like being 14 0 down in a game and getting back to 14 all at half time the game then starts again and thats how it is with us were back to square one and were already thinking about the st george illawarra game youve got to focus on your next game and nothing beyond that and with the middle of the table so tight the size of the wins and losses come into play as well
663026 to lose by just a point means their points differential stays strong
663027 you cant afford 30 point spreads at this stage of the season it does too much damage to your chances
663028 we dont want to be under the pump and relying on other results
663029 we missed out on a place in the finals on points for and against last year so we know how hard that is to take we want to make sure of it through our own performances and take everything else out of the equation
663030 weve been a bit win loss win loss this year but we know that if we keep winning now well be ok
663031 were going to have to win three or four of our last five games to get in so its just week to week now were going to turn up like its a finals game against the dragons on friday night even though we only conceded one try today well work on our defence this week because the dragons have got a lot more attacking weapons than the bulldogs at the moment

663033 whatever issues that arose from his resignation were discussed but the matter is still at the discussion stage
663034 its football season now im trying to put everything behind me and concentrate on the season now its a good thing
663035 i have the support of a great organization and my teammates were all behind me and my family and my wife
663036 its just time to focus on the season now and put everything behind me
663037 thats kind of between me and the team what happened in there is kind of between us
663038 all i can say is that theyre really supportive of me and its a great reflection on what kind of organization were in here they really help their teammates out it was nice
663039 lets just say that if this show increased the sleaze factor by over nine thousand and focused on being about sexy evil space nazi robo bitches youd have my attention
663040 where the bloody hell did you learn to speak like that
663041 mao was responsible for well over 70 million deaths of the chinese in peacetime and he was as evil as hitler or stalin
663042 and he did as much damage to mankind as hitler and stalin
663043 in china we interviewed about 150 of maos inner circle in maos family relatives friends
663044 i did not realize how much of the misery and hardship he caused was done knowingly and so ruthlessly in terms of his own personal interests
663045 he said in his later life i was lying in the litter
663046 whoever linked up with moscow had the communications with moscow and was recognized by moscow as the party leader would be the boss
663047 so at the end of the long march mao is number one
663048 well stalin i think spotted mao as probably the guy in the chinese communist party most like himself
663049 and of course mao also like stalin had long range vision i mean mao could think strategically he was very very smart
663050 and mao didnt want to stop he said for all his projects to take off half of china may well have to die
663051 and when he was shown the report of you know food shortages of peasants starving mao said educate the peasant to eat less
663052 he even said death have benefit they can fertilize the land
663053 it brought trauma misery torture death to hundreds of millions of people
663054 my father was one of the few who stood up to mao and opposed the cultural revolution
663055 and as a result he was arrested tortured driven insane and he was exiled to a camp and died very young
663056 she went through over a hundred of those denunciation meetings
663057 and she was made to kneel on broken glass and she was paraded in the streets where children spat at her and threw stones at her
663058 instead he would have his servants his mistresses wiping him every day with a hot towel
663059 he didnt like to wash his hair either and he liked this slightly itchy feeling
663060 you know we were told that socialist china was paradise on earth
663061 i blamed people around mao i blamed madame mao but i could never contemplate mao
663062 how do you explain the economic miracle thats transformed china
663063 the economic miracles happened because mao died and people had had enough of living under maos kind of rule
663064 they became more equal in you know basically slave labor
663065 if theres one criticism that has come to light in the book is that theres such an unrelenting sort of attack on mao
663066 well one way to answer that would be to say no
663067 should one be even handed about hitler for example i mean mao did what he did
663068 i mean they think he is still the great hero
663069 so the truth of mao really isnt out in the open in china even now 30 years after his death

663087 while we believe that kellys choice of words was inadvertent and that she did not intend them in an offensive manner the words were hurtful and grossly inappropriate
663088 consequently we have decided to suspend kelly for two weeks effective immediately
663089 on friday during our golf broadcast nick faldo and i were discussing tigers dominance in the golf world and i used some poorly chosen words
663090 i have known tiger for 12 years and i have apologized directly to him i also apologize to our viewers who may have been offended by my comments
663091 tiger and kelly are friends and tiger has a great deal of respect for kelly regardless of the choice of words used we know unequivocally that there was no ill intent in her comments this story is a non issue in our eyes

663095 this provision reflects the unprecedented conditions in global credit markets and in particular the rapid deterioration in the united states housing market mr stewart said
663096 unfortunately the worst case scenario might not be too far away from the most likely scenario
663097 continued risk of more provisions on its exposure to us1 1 billion 1 14 billion of cdos
663098 these were sound commercial and credit decisions given the market and ratings data available at the time mr stewart said
663099 now we begin the most important part of our campaign to make a respectful determined and convincing case to the american people that our campaign and my election as president given the alternatives presented by our friends in the other party are in the best interests of the country we love
663100 i was confident we would come back one look at the dressing room shows you how much potential this team has
663101 one look at the dressing room shows you how much potential this team has ive mentioned this before that weve done this in the past this team has been through ups and downs and it has a fair amount of experience and quality theres no doubt that we would regroup and come back hard im really proud of the way we played in this test
663102 people generally say that we dont start well and the results probably show that we had enough time and prepared enough but it the loss at the ssc was one of those games where nothing went right for us
663103 the way weve come back after four days is amazing this group has shown amazing resilience not just once but time and time again
663104 the opening partnerships in both innings virender getting a double hundred and gautam getting us off to fantastic starts in both innings was very important also the way harbhajan singh bowled in both innings and how ishant sharma and zaheer khan bowled today there is quality in this team and it augurs really well going into the last test
663105 you cannot keep looking at one individual to say he can do better everyone can do better
663106 overall if all of us had done better maybe we would have finished the game in three days there is definitely improvement we need to look at as a team and that will be the focus
663107 we had the runs and not many teams have chased 300 in the fourth innings
663108 so it was important that we went in with some positive outlook the way ishant and zaheer started out was brilliant
663109 in these conditions when hes bowling at 140 kph actually i didnt see the speeds but the way the keeper was collecting the ball you could sense that he was in good rhythm and thats a good sign getting three wickets within 40 minutes was critical and put sri lanka totally on the back foot
663110 as the series goes on you try and figure out the best possible ways to handle the spinners
663111 its 1 1 and we need to assess the conditions at the p sara stadium and then we will take a call were really confident of putting up a good show and if we repeat this performance we will get a good result
663112 i dont think two games and two wins makes a career but its two wins and im happy to be a part of it

663116 if you noticed all the nice looking expensive cups were taken up leaving behind the plain and cheap ones while it is but normal for you to want only the best for yourselves that is the source of your problems and stress
663117 be assured that the cup itself adds no quality to the coffee in most cases its just more expensive and in some cases even hides what we drink what all of you really wanted was coffee not the cup but you consciously went for the best cups and then began eyeing each others cups
663118 now consider this life is the coffee and the jobs houses cars things money and position in society are the cups they are just tools to hold and contain life and the type of cup we have does not define nor change the quality of life we live sometimes by concentrating only on the cup we fail to enjoy the coffee life has provided us

663120 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
663121 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
663122 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
663123 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
663124 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
663125 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
663126 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and i think thats great
663127 if prices stay at these levels that could lead to some significant rearrangement of production among sectors and countries
663128 you could have a very significant shock to traditional consumption patterns and also some important growth effects
663129 the cost of moving goods not the cost of tariffs is the largest barrier to global trade today
663130 has effectively offset all the trade liberalization efforts of the last three decades
663131 it would be a mistake a misinterpretation to think that a huge rollback or reversal of fundamental trends is under way
663132 distance and trade costs do matter but we are still in a globalized era
663133 theres just a handful of us left but it has become easier for us domestic folks to compete
663134 this is not just about steel but also maple syrup and avocados and blueberries at the grocery store
663135 avocado salad in minneapolis in january is just not going to work in this new world because flying it in is going to make it cost as much as a rib eye
663136 being green is in their best interests not so much in making money as saving money
663137 green companies are likely to be a permanent trend as these vulnerabilities continue but its going to take a long time for all this to settle down
663138 cannot take a risk that the just in time system wont function because the whole global trading system is based on that notion
663139 they are going to have to have redundancies in the supply chain like more warehousing and multiple sources of supply and even production
663140 baseball is cubas national sport and cuba is the reigning olympic champion so we must do it again this time
663141 but these olympic games are going to be the most difficult ones from a historic standpoint with so many strong teams in competition
663142 i feel a great responsibility on my shoulders but we have made many sacrifices in order to reach that goal
663143 they had learned how to eat the spicy korean food with chopsticks the way it is done in eastern asia
663144 i am not worried about that we do not force anybody to do anything everyone thinks and acts according to their own will
663145 i hope the sky can stay blue like this both during and after the olympic games
663146 this will give foreigners a good impression of the city and leave a legacy to beijing citizens
663147 its much better than i expected theres none of the gunk in the air
663148 there is a little haze in the air but that reminds me of los angeles in 1984 but its nothing like ive been reading about
663149 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
663150 a safe olympics is also a key indicator of the positive reflection of our nations image
663151 protest by athletes doesnt really mar the games because that is something even the ioc would be opposed to
663152 but i think major protests that the chinese put down in front of television cameras particularly if they are foreign protesters that could look very bad
663153 theyre a physical team a big team but we played with a lot of energy it was a big win
663154 even though were so far away from the states it felt like we were playing at home
663155 it has never been done before i doubt it will be repeated this is it weve got a golden opportunity to fast forward our research
663156 i immediately jumped off my seat i thought this is what ive been waiting for i said thank god for the olympics for me this is 10 times better than winning the lottery
663157 if mother nature cooperates i expect there would be an impact but it all depends on the wind directions
663158 its a giant science experiment on air pollution as far as i know its the biggest case where a city that had air quality problems took strong measures to improve air quality theyve taken it very seriously its exciting from a science standpoint
663159 they didnt have to go to quite the extremes that beijing has beijing has had to come a long way further than l a or atlanta
663160 its not just about china its about megacities across the world whats learned here can perhaps be applied to other cities
663161 he was with us last week at our national championships seeing us off and giving us words of wisdom
663162 mark lenzi the 1992 springboard gold medalist and 1996 bronze medalist has also been visiting our training centre and that type of thing
663163 they are really wanting us to win they want us to move forward
663164 they truly want to be involved greg has been a great support hes been to a lot of our training camps over the past three years and mark has most recently got involved because hes back into coaching
663165 both of them have just given us words of wisdom and words of advice and said heres what it is and go do it
663166 i think we have done a better job now of preparing our men than we have in the past years so i think were going to be able to step it up
663167 the chinese certainly are favored they are on their home soil and theyve dominated the sport for the last couple of decades
663168 a dissonant 12 tone piece but youll like it anyway
663169 personally i think we will start formal monitoring of ozone and pm 2 5 from next year
663170 we cannot keep up some of the temporary measures up after the olympic games but they will provide experience for future measures

663199 the altima coupe is more than just two less doors it offers its own unique interpretation of nissans exhilarating driving pleasure the coupes aggressive design driver oriented cockpit and unique styling give it an extensive amount of separation from the sedan
663200 altima coupe is sleek and sporty featuring an aggressive stance and a bold shoulder that adds dimension to the body side
663201 its a car that looks much more expensive than it is both the exterior and interior and feels like it too
663202 the driving performance of the altima coupe is biased toward sporty feel especially when equipped with our award winning v6
663203 handling is also a strong point of the coupe as is the responsiveness feeling provided by the xtronic cvt transmission

663235 terrorists are carrying out a proxy war against india they are aided and abetted from across the border we expected that manmohan singh would question the pakistans prime minister on this issue but he has disappointed

663246 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while

663250 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
663251 we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
663252 some obama backers are right to worry the relentless daily attacks on the candidate will take their toll on the campaign
663253 these types of campaigns which the media often helps todrive as it analyses the effectiveness of the attacks before questioning the accuracy of theinformation will continue from now until election day on november 4
663254 and its time for the obama campaign to build a political firewall by using outside surrogates unaffiliated with the candidate to debunk these misleading attacks
663255 there is some evidence that the balance of enthusiasm has shifted and that young people who seemed to turn out and vote for senator obama in unusually high numbers in the primaries and caucuses are no longer so enthusiastic about him
663256 i think they are cynical and want to distract people from talking about the real issues
663257 im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama im african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia
663258 i think commissioner mick keelty is on record certainly some senior afp managers are on record as saying counter terrorism takes priority over everything drop everything if theres a ct matter on
663259 i believe its left a vacuum in what we considered our priority crime types prior to that
663260 such as fraud against the commonwealth and illicit drug trafficking theyre probably the main two people smuggling came into it when there was a huge boost on that in the late 1990s
663261 where the afp has been hurting most is back in those core areas of expanding activity
663262 the federal government has taken its focus off street crime since 9 11 asking law enforcement to do more with less
663263 its a false choice between fighting terrorism and fighting crime
663264 keelty would say chasing terrorists is now a core job for the afp
663265 id say a core job for the afp is dealing with serious crime now terrorism is a serious crime but on any risk management analysis you would not put 1 billion a year into terrorism
663266 the keelty years have been years which clearly understood that the afps rise to prominence in the policing firmament in australia was dependent on being involved in those high profile operations which had a political dimension
663267 they were in a position as an independent police force to resist that trend and they didnt
663268 the afp is ripe for a review in terms of what its doing and what we expect it to be doing and about how far we want its jurisdiction to extend
663269 countries have gone to war over outrages like this they dont like having their embassies in foreign capitals blown up by terrorists working with spy agencies in neighbouring countries
663270 with details of the pakistani ordnance from wah it was game set and match and gilani was cornered
663271 he had nowhere to go but to back down and agree to a full scale inquiry
663272 but where that takes him is anybodys bet the armys furious about the way the isi is being pilloried president pervez musharraf is outraged the governments on the nose this could turn out to be the crunch in the short and unhappy life of this civilian government
663273 a long running global boom in developing nations such as china and india which is lifting global demand for food and pushing up prices all over the world as a result second the more recent adoption of policies which are subsidising the use of fuel such as ethanol and third six years of drought in australia
663274 organisation for economic co operation and development data shows food prices in australia have grown by 67 8 per over the period from 1990 to 2006 or about 3 3 per cent a year on average yet australias food price growth was less than the average across all oecd countries which was 73 1 per cent from 1990 to 2006
663275 lets not be perverse weve all benefited from the economies of scale of the retail chains as well as from the competition that has accompanied the rise and fall of smaller chains and franchises so we should think carefully before jumping into changes in the way we regulate supermarkets and retail chains
663276 grocerywatch will be like fuelwatch a farce the chains move their prices around all the time put items on special mark prices down to move them have a large range of brands or generics for the same product which ones will the monitors choose for comparison sake

663282 both jess and lisa have had an incredibly difficult week and without doubt i am talking to them and helping them out where i can
663283 from the whole situation with the pictures to lisas break up with dean i cant even imagine how they are coping with it all
663284 what has happened with those images is obviously completely illegal and there are lawyers getting involved
663285 its just such an upsetting situation there is a real tall poppy situation in australia and both jess and lisa deserve more support especially from their australian fans
663286 at the moment they are being advised not to say anything because theyre still getting their head around it themselves its all been pretty crazy
663287 but if things keep progressing between them they wont have a problem discussing it further down the track
663288 politics is a combative industry if you want something youve got to put your hand up and go for it
663289 we are all saying what a terrific bloke he is what a fantastic talent he is how much we miss him we love him we want him
663290 deep anxiety about his costellos ability to govern for ordinary australians
663291 he sculled the first bottle and then some people were egging him on to scull the next one
663292 police have taken samples of the alcohol they were drinking and just want to find out what was in it
663293 hes not quite six foot and hes probably 15 stone id say i was pretty close to my son
663294 he wasnt really into sports hes more into playing on the computer and things like that
663295 we used to talk over the phone or wed meet in the street or go car racing im into racing cars and hes always been there as my pit crew
663296 in this case what police are investigating is that he has died unusually or unexpectedly after attending a party all detectives can say is hed been at a party and had been drinking
663297 it will devastate any small country town and its bound to be quite devastating for virtually everyone
663298 you will find that everyone knew him in some way or another
663299 we unfortunately have a culture among many young people to drink to get drunk and many people believe the more you drink the more popular you will be
663300 the idea came about when my daughters friend needed dental work but there was a 12 month waiting list
663301 it has to be run every year its disgraceful in a country as wealthy as australia
663302 the aim is to try and make a dent in the waiting lists
663303 i commend the dentists who do the work but its not acceptable that any government think the problem is solved
663304 its given them a lazy way out its not a solution

663309 thats why we need a strong partnership between indigenous leadership our major companies as well as the government itself supporting this plan on the way through
663310 we would hope to be able to find sources but whether we will or not i dont know we do get animals that are donated but not enough
663311 we dont believe theres any genuine reason why this source of animals should be stopped
663312 certainly if we lose these sources then our education system will suffer without a doubt
663313 we wouldnt be using them if we could do the same training in an alternative way
663314 virtually everywhere in europe an america they use alternatives which they say are good if not better
663315 you obviously dont operate on healthy humans so why do it on animals
663316 my view is that using animals for scientific testing isnt something we can continue to support
663317 there are more than 3500 policies that will be reviewed and changed
663318 while the queensland gas scheme is not necessarily incompatible with a national cap and trade scheme both schemes are likely to promote the use of gas
663319 therefore its interaction with the carbon pollution reduction scheme needs careful consideration to avoid the imposition of unnecessary cost
663320 state and territory governments are encouraged to discontinue their market based program once the carbon pollution reduction scheme commences
663321 the queensland gas scheme is providing a more environmentally friendly alternative source of energy and we will be working with the federal government to make sure any new arrangements continue to involve the development of our gas industry
663322 most police divisions struggle to put two cars on the road each shift and those crews can have up to 30 jobs backed up on their call sign when they start duty
663323 i would love to be on the road for any entire shift to catch crooks
663324 her only answer to every issue is to pretend its not happening
663325 we need more police presence where young people are active
663326 these youth gangs should be home in bed police have got to have the power to get them home where they belong
663327 they have the statistics but they dont want them released because they are embarrassing
663328 im concerned by advice from the police commissioner that what were starting to see in relation to youth violence is firstly younger teenagers involved secondly more girls involved in this sort of activity and thirdly a higher likelihood that some sort of weapon particularly knives being involved
663329 these are difficult issues for our police they involve responsibility from our schools from parents and from the community and a law enforcement response

663335 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
663336 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
663337 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
663338 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
663339 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
663340 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
663341 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
663342 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
663343 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
663344 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
663345 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
663346 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
663347 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
663348 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
663349 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
663350 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
663351 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
663352 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
663353 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
663354 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
663355 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
663356 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
663357 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
663358 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
663359 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
663360 anyone who knows who and where you are is a security hole
663361 i own a gun i have an escape route if someone comes im ready
663362 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
663363 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
663364 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
663365 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
663366 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
663367 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
663368 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
663369 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
663370 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
663371 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
663372 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
663373 who are open to doing something on the production side
663374 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
663375 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
663376 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
663377 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
663378 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
663379 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
663380 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
663381 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
663382 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
663383 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
663384 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
663385 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
663386 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
663387 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
663388 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
663389 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
663390 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
663391 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
663392 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
663393 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
663394 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
663395 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
663396 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
663397 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
663398 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

663401 part of being on the road means the ability to live a little more luxuriously than at home and that means not having to turn off the lights and the tv
663402 people say they want to be green but they dont want to compromise
663403 said they would suffer discomfort because they would get back to their room and it would be extremely hot
663404 indicated that entering a dark room could be a safety issue
663405 oh my god should i hit the low or high flush button
663406 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
663407 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
663408 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
663409 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
663410 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
663411 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
663412 if you have commented on gosmelltheflowers com earlier you will need to
663413 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
663414 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
663415 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
663416 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
663417 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
663418 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
663419 you just got owned rex i particularly like the bit when she called you a walnut whip
663420 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
663421 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
663422 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
663423 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
663424 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
663425 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
663426 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
663427 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
663428 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
663429 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
663430 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
663431 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
663432 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
663433 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
663434 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
663435 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
663436 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
663437 according to the bible it says that adam came first then eve
663438 yes dear that is true according to the word of god
663439 daddy always told me it is ladies before gentlemen didnt that rule apply during the creation time
663440 he said he felt he had put in the performance of his life so to be given nul points by 22 countries was humiliating especially after he staked in a large amount of his own cash
663441 the result was both a personal and financial blow and as a result handy andy has decided to turn his hand to property developing hes got a few properties hes working on at the moment its not a great economic climate but its marginally better than the music industry
663442 these three men are walking outside when my son is lying dead
663443 these three men didnt get to mykonos to help my son these three men were there to hurt my son
663444 id just like to appeal to all the mothers and fathers all over the world to understand how we feel for the fact that these three men are now walking outside
663445 those ads really were focused on two things they were focused on the fact that sen obama wants to raise taxes and im opposed of it and he opposes an energy policy which would work including offshore drilling so the message there is therere stark differences between myself and sen obama
663446 were not gonna allow racism to come into this campaign in any form
663447 and so im gonna respond if it comes up again
663448 he opposes nuclear power he opposes most every measure incentives to build a battery driven car so im not surprised that hes hedging on this issue but the fact is he still opposes offshore drilling sen obama is still opposed to a comprehensive energy plan
663449 it seems to me the only thing he wants us to do is inflate tires
663450 i am really starting to hate this unctuous double talking creep
663451 well obama wants to raise taxes on the wealthy and has actually proposed bigger middle class tax cuts than you have sen mccain
663452 h e opposes an energy policy which would work including offshore drilling
663453 were not gonna allow racism to come into this campaign in any form
663454 sen obama is still opposed to a comprehensive energy plan
663455 at this point i dont care if obama flips on every single issue i will do everything i can to see this jackass defeated
663456 the aba are going to have to do something come up with something really good
663457 i think if a good deals put in place i could stay until 2012 if nothings put in place to stay amateur then theres no chance but theyve told us they will so well see
663458 uk sport have done everything for us the money tracksuits if people want to get me to stay amateur the aba are going to have to come up with something
663459 its all on the aba if they come up with the goods theyve been promising after the commonwealth games we were supposed to be getting things but its never happened
663460 now aba chief executive paul kings saying hes going to do this and hes going to do that but he hasnt done anything yet
663461 they keep saying theyre going to give us more money youll know after the olympics whether hes kept his promise as to whether ive stayed amateur or not
663462 they have to stick to their promises like uk sport do you hear things from them that havent been kept
663463 we never had tracksuits until recently when uk sport came up with them
663464 you see our opponents walking around in tracksuits and we walk around in our own clothes its not very good uk sport got us one with a days notice
663465 theyve let themselves down really making promises they dont keep id feel like you lose pride doing that
663466 uk sport can only do so much and its been more than enough
663467 ive been approached by nearly everyone and had money put down
663468 but i had a bit of advice off coaches and terry i didnt know what i was going to do but now im glad ive opted to stay amateur
663469 i spoke to someone a couple of months ago and they offered me a certain amount to sign with them before the olympics but i dont want to make any decisions until afterwards
663470 it seemed like a lot of money to me because i havent got much but i havent decided whether i want to go professional yet because of london 2012 so i had to turn them down point blank
663471 they could also try to look elsewhere for sponsorship for us because all these other sports in the olympics seem to be getting good sponsorship deals off major companies
663472 none of us have got personal sponsorship deals and hopefully that could change after the olympics and that would be a big thing to stay for
663473 i want to keep my team very positive and very focused at whats coming forward
663474 whats happened at this present stage is history and we hope that post beijing we can deal with this and we can sort it
663475 what we need to do is to keep our minds on the job in hand instead of being too negative these lads are going to do our country proud thats the main thing
663476 its difficult to keep them i think we have a good youth system which is very important to ajax but its been like this for the last 25 years
663477 its important to keep players for as long as possible maybe with money maybe with other promises
663478 to finish with a birdie was a little bit extra
663479 i kept it together pretty well today but i was emotional on the first tee and coming up the final few holes
663480 i was pleased to play well and score in the 60s i just wish the birdie putt at the last had been for the championship
663481 i saw a sign on the scoreboard saying annika youll be missed and then i was greeted with all the applause
663482 its been 15 great years of golf and i just really enjoyed the moment it was also nice to share it with my caddie terry mcnamara weve been together for nine years and we are great friends so i wanted him to enjoy it too
663483 better to be judged by twelve than be carried by six
663484 bij mama blijven hoor anders kom je onder de auto
663485 zo spaar jij bonen het kwam er erg droog uit en we hebben met zn vieren enorm gelachen om de gespaarde bonen waarschijnlijk niet zo grappig voor jullie maar wij hebben er hard om moeten lachen
663486 oh ik ken ook iemand die daar werkt en nu in de gemeenteraad van katwijk zit
663487 creemos que a diferencia de lo que se ala el gobierno nuestra econom a s est en crisis la mezcla de bajo crecimiento y alta inflaci n es preocupante y todos los sectores pol ticos debemos contribuir con un an lisis sereno y con una actitud constructiva a enfrentar ambos problemas
663488 hey shes ur mother therefore no matter what she does respect her
663489 the eldest sibling in the family must take care and slog it out for the rest
663490 hey strip naked why are u wearing clothes everywhere u go we didnt do that and we lived fine
663491 give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free the wretched refuse of your teeming shore send these the homeless tempest tost to me i lift my lamp beside the golden door
663492 i havent seen anything that tells me it alters the brain chemistry
663493 i havent seen anything that tells me there are real physiological negative ramification from using the internet
663494 its more in like the impulse control category like kleptomania or people who set fires non specified and thats kind of a catch all tv addiction fits in there too
663495 conceptually the diagnosis is a compulsive impulsive spectrum disorder that involves online and or offline computer usage and consists of three subtypes excessive gaming sexual preoccupations and e mail text messaging
663496 these compulsive behaviors can have very serious health and social consequences ranging from fatigue depression social isolation and poor work performance
663497 in some very extreme cases those addicted to internet use have suffered cardiopulmonary related deaths
663498 about 80 percent of those needing treatment may need psychotropic medications and perhaps 20 to 24 percent require hospitalization
663499 unlike in asia where internet cafes are frequently used in the united states games and virtual sex are accessed at home
663500 attempts to measure the phenomenon are clouded by shame denial and minimization
663501 they may be the same people who previously before the internet made contact via telephone to others many times a day
663502 as the internet becomes even more commonplace and affordable more people will have the opportunity to develop an addiction to viewing the internet
663503 i have heard that it can also become quite problematic particularly when pornography is involved and its a substitute for intimacy because the individual who is involved in a relationship because they have his real intimate connection with the other person
663504 my personal belief is if you spend 20 hours behind a computer and not interacting or talking to people youre not going to develop the nonverbal communication skills that is so much in the interaction between people
663505 i think people can stunt their ability to interact appropriately with other people
663506 but doing those things at home without pushing yourself to leave actually worsens it for the folk who are on that path
663507 but if there wasnt any of that stuff there and if it was really troublesome to them you could do one or two things you could do psychotherapy to help set limits and then probably consider some medication for impulse control disorders
663508 i dont have anything to back this up but personally i believe a lot of people blame addiction for a lot of societys ills
663509 internet addiction and pornography addiction and texting addiction and that stuff is really taking it a bit too far in my opinion
663510 if youre working for the short term you go sign somebody in november and thats what you sell from november till april 1
663511 if that is part of a more viable longer term plan then it makes sense but if its only short term to try to motivate people to buy season tickets for one more year thats probably not something that were interested in doing
663512 if we move the fences in is that sort of a backhanded excuse for the fact that we didnt do such and such offensively this year the fences dont have anything to do with a 235 batting average
663513 on the other hand if we brought the fences in would it be more or less entertaining at petco thats what i care about is there a comparative advantage or disadvantage competitively both of those things are a consideration weve tinkered once were not going to blow up petco weve got some constraints weve got concrete walls there are some things were not going to do
663514 what we have to establish in the minds of people is that look this is a good organization weve got a good plan and ive got confidence in them for the long haul
663515 any time you have a year like this that confidence takes a hit
663516 you have a lot more young guys at this point in the season than weve ever had since weve moved into the new ballpark
663517 i would expect them to get two or three veteran guys they dont have to be huge pieces just veteran guys and veteran presence to take some of the edge off of younger players help alleviate those growing pains
663518 up until the 1960s it was assumed that these guys are supermen they dont get depressed they dont have addictions
663519 no one would recognize the pain these guys were having and that they were subject to the same illnesses all of us are when society went to drugs athletes went to drugs they were part of society
663520 there was the old greek ideal sound mind sound body with these physical specimens it was assumed how could they fall prey to cocaine or something like that that was for people with weak wills and no character and these guys obviously were strong people
663521 they get girls pregnant they use drugs more than the average population
663522 is a weakness i can solve my own problems the stigmas there athletes are all about being in control and it scares them that they arent in control and they see it as a weakness and are afraid that if the word gets out when they do seek counseling other athletes will prey on that
663523 basically was educational creating an environment within the organization and the sport that recognized young men need tools other than playing tools to succeed
663524 sensitive to the environment they were in kids are not going to come jumping out of the woodwork to talk to you about their problems
663525 athletes are just young people that have this ability they usually have very little education and generally rely on their physical skills to get them through life and you know how long that lasts
663526 every major psychiatric problem that exists in the book schizophrenia personality disorders dysfunctional families relationship problems sexual problems sexual identity problems theyre no different than anybody else
663527 id say that athletes have the same range of problems as anybody else
663528 however the professional or college athlete has been honed for a specific skill their whole self identity is wrapped up in that one thing they can do very well almost as if they have a part not a whole person functioning
663529 so theyre frequently losing touch with themselves and with other people and probably are at risk of more psychological problems than the average population
663530 it looks better if they bring us in since they already have massage therapists acupuncturists nutritionists and so on
663531 it looks more holistic like theyre trying to help their athletes before they get into trouble drinking getting into risky sexual behaviors gambling situations
663532 to work with these athletes on the human being part because there are a lot of stresses and a tremendous amount of risky behavior as they get more vain and get more money and their lifestyles change in tremendous ways
663533 im very happy there have been various incidents this season that have happened when ive been in a position to fight for a victory
663534 the team have kept pushing and im very glad to get this first win
663535 its fantastic a great moment something ive been targeting for many years hopefully this is the first of many
663536 i couldnt believe it when i saw felipes engine go and i was p2 so this is remarkable after the race in hockenheim and the big crash
663537 ive made the decision to stand down as england captain
663538 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
663539 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
663540 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
663541 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
663542 i think weve been building towards the leeds game and the trip to saints as an indication of where we actually are in this competition weve passed one test against leeds but it should be an even bigger one against saints
663543 winning becomes a habit and weve been winning games without playing particularly well which is a good sign
663544 we havent got a great record against them but theres no time like the present to knock them off
663545 may i be happy may i be at peace may i be free from suffering
663546 may you be happy may you be at peace may you be free from suffering

663551 at first i wanted to stay in the premier league and i had the pen in my hand to sign
663552 then the gaffer called me up about rangers and spoke very well with me and i chose rangers it was very difficult to leave england but i think this was a good choice
663553 i know its a big club last year they won two trophies its a dream to come to rangers because they play in europe every year
663554 its the ambition of every player to play in the champions league or the uefa cup which is why i came here
663555 it is mainly corporations that have the skills to make technological innovations work for the poor

663560 esos cambios me sirvieron como experiencia estaba indecisa me gustaban las materias de bioqu mica pero no me ve a trabajando en eso cursar algunas materias me ayud a decidirme por ser m dica
663561 los datos dejan ver un sistema universitario para decirlo en crudos t rminos econ micos altamente ineficiente lo que muestran es bastante incapacidad para retener a los alumnos estudiando y avanzando en sus estudios
663562 las universidades toman en cuenta alumnos que se vuelven a inscribir aunque no hayan aprobado nada el a o anterior y que son potenciales desertores nuevamente
663563 las universidades son flexibles frente a estos alumnos no todas aplican lo que dice la ley y muchas s lo toman una materia como condici n de regularidad
663564 un factor explicativo es la desorientaci n con que muchos alumnos llegan a la universidad sin saber bien qu quieren estudiar se inscriben vienen a clase algunas semanas y se dan cuenta de que no es para ellos o se anotan y ni aparecen
663565 tampoco puede pretenderse que cursos de un mes o poco m s remedien los graves problemas del secundario
663566 hay situaciones de parar y seguir en la carrera por condiciones familiares profesionales y laborales
663567 all se agrega la necesidad de trabajar de muchos estudiantes factor sobre el cual las universidades tienen muy escasa capacidad de control por la debilidad de los programas de becas y otras ayudas a los alumnos de menores recursos
663568 las razones son las mismas quiz no pueden pagar un a o y vuelven al siguiente o consiguen trabajo y deben abandonar
663569 algunas privadas tienen un sistema de tutores que no siempre es eficiente el fen meno es el mismo que en las p blicas se habla mucho de estrategias de retenci n pero se hace poco en la pr ctica y lo que se hace no es sistem tico
663570 accede a la universidad gente de bajos recursos que trabaja tenemos la obligaci n de estar pensando c mo sostener a los alumnos en el sistema
663571 la universidad no puede ser selectiva el desaf o es dar calidad y hay que ver c mo la universidad se est haciendo cargo de la gesti n pedag gica
663572 la universidad no est preparada para gente que trabaja y en muchos trabajos no te quieren tomar cuando saben que estudi s carreras como medicina tan demandantes porque piensan que vas a pedir muchos d as por examen

663721 mari sekarang kita tanyakan pada ali tentang suatu masalah saja bagaimana jawaban ali tentang masalah itu kita bisa menilai seberapa jauh kepandaiannya bagaimana apakah kalian setuju
663722 dengan begitu kita dapat mencari kelemahan ali namun bila jawaban ali nanti selalu berbeda beda barulah kita percaya bahwa memang ali adalah orang yang cerdas
663723 ilmu adalah warisan para nabi dan rasul sedangkan harta adalah warisan qarun firaun namrud dan lain lainnya
663724 karena ilmu akan menjaga dirimu sementara harta malah sebaliknya engkau harus menjaganya
663725 sebab orang yang mempunyai banyak harta akan mempunyai banyak musuh sedangkan orang yang kaya ilmu akan banyak orang yang menyayanginya dan hormat kepadanya
663726 jelas jelas harta akan semakin berkurang namun bila ilmu yang engkau pergunakan maka akan semakin bertambah banyak
663727 jika pemilik harta ada yang menyebutnya pelit sedangkan pemilik ilmu akan dihargai dan disegani
663728 harta akan selalu dijaga dari kejahatan sedangkan ilmu tidak usah dijaga dari kejahatan lagi pula ilmu akan menjagamu
663729 pemilik ilmu akan diberi syafaat oleh allah subhaanahu wa taala di hari kiamat nanti sementara pemilik harta akan dihisab oleh allah kelak
663730 antara ilmu dan harta manakah yang lebih utama wahai ali
663731 harta akan habis sedangkan ilmu malah sebaliknya ilmu akan abadi
663732 akan dijunjung tinggi hanya karena hartanya sedangkan orang yang kaya ilmu dianggap intelektual
663733 harta akan membuatmu tidak tenang dengan kata lain akan mengeraskan hatimu tetapi ilmu sebaliknya akan menyinari hatimu hingga hatimu akan menjadi terang dan tentram karenanya
663734 andaikata engkau datangkan semua orang untuk bertanya insya allah akan aku jawab dengan jawaban yang berbeda beda pula selagi aku masih hidup

663765 setting the minimum marriage age at 18 has been a proposal since 2000 but the yemeni parliaments islamic sharia codification committee has not yet presented the amendments to parliament for discussion
663766 but amendments to the law in 1999 made it unclear and the law now fails to mention an exact minimum age for marriage it only authorises the girls guardian to decide whether she is physically and psychologically prepared for marriage
663767 but there are extreme groups in society and in parliament which are against amending the law
663768 hormone and physical changes which confuse her body growth and affect her health in the long and medium term

663770 tg why do you doubt it is a consecrated host do you doubt his ability to get one do you doubt his willingness to desecrate one youre grasping at straws
663771 you can find truth by looking at your world with fresh eyes and a questioning mind
663772 making a decent barbeque from it in front of the temple does that not make you feel slightly strange
663773 and still no one has substantively countered my analogies im not surprised

663775 what would he do if catholics and other christians and even sympathetic members of other faiths turned up en masse on his campus simply to pray quietly for him
663776 this whole cracker business is too meaningless and i hope that it will die down soon its hard to believe that either side can invest as many electrons to this business as they have
663777 they are just paper nothing must be held sacred question everything
663778 not that theres any substantial difference between the consecrated and unconsecrated version
663779 i am part of the church and i believe in what it teaches and we are all one in christ
663780 just start subjecting all ideas that are presented to you to this very same treatment
663781 the god delusion is about what we dont believe the eucharist and the koran are symbols of what other people do believe i wouldve preferred a genuine work of science to be among the desecratees vivek
663782 no desecration would have taken place were the host not consecrated and thus no catholic would even bother to notice yet pz claims the host was consecrated let him prove hi8s claim nobody has to believe it is the body of christ for the act of consecration is a public act perfomed by a catholic priest so wheres the proof or is this place not about science after all
663783 nothing must be held sacred question everything god is not great jesus is not your lord you are not disciples of any charismatic prophet you are all human beings who must make your way through your life by thinking and learning and you have the job of advancing humanities knowledge by winnowing out the errors of past generations and finding deeper understanding of reality you will not find wisdom in rituals and sacraments and dogma which build only self satisfied ignorance but you can find truth by looking at your world with fresh eyes and a questioning mind
663784 no way bananas have to be brown to taste right chiquita says so
663785 youre just accepting myers word on faith that it was real
663786 hmm some smart guy talk about being totally stupid i can only think of gods mercy toward this guy is going to be a baseball bat to his head so he finally gets it through that head of his that the eucharist is jesus
663787 in this sacrament is recapitulated the whole mystery of our salvation
663788 for all of you hoping for the long threads of catholics and religious i laugh out of the first 100 ive read there was one maybe a questionable two
663789 suppose your are an embalmer you are busy embalming a person for an open coffin ceremony and you decide to pilfer there lush locks of blonde hair
663790 3 young ladies like to wear an item of clothing called a mini skirt these days
663791 he is still as culpable as someone who chooses to attack say the more benign and watered down religions of quakerism unitarian universalism
663792 fwiw i never read any post that is longer than a screen until i see who wrote it and then i only read the long posts of the regulars
663793 not long ago atheists like yourself and yes they were atheists so dont try your usual canards killed 6 million of them
663794 anyone who speaks a word against the son of man that is jesus will be forgiven
663795 as a usenet discussion grows longer the probability of a comparison involving nazis or hitler approaches one
663796 indeed when religious people quarrel about religion or hungry people quarrel about victuals it looks as if they had not much of either among them benjamin franklin
663797 god is not great jesus is not your lord you are not disciples of any charismatic prophet you are all human beings who must make your way through your life by thinking and learning and you have the job of advancing humanities knowledge by winnowing out the errors of past generations and finding deeper understanding of reality you will not find wisdom in rituals and sacraments and dogma which build only self satisfied ignorance but you can find truth by looking at your world with fresh eyes and a questioning mind
663798 im going to raise a glass of laphroaig in toast
663799 i pierced it the host with a rusty nail i hope jesuss tetanus shots are up to date and then i simply threw it in the trash
663800 they are just paper nothing must be held sacred his emphasis question everything god is not great jesus is not your lord you are not disciples of any charismatic prophet
663801 the university must now take action and apply the appropriate sanction
663802 it is important for catholics to know that the university of minnesota will not tolerate the deliberate destruction of the eucharist by one of its faculty just as african americans would not tolerate the burning of a cross and jews would not tolerate the display of swastikas catholics will not tolerate the desecration of the eucharist
663803 that is meaningless it is just an abuse of the english language what you are in effect saying is that it is both the same and different that is simply nonsensical what properties does it have after consecration that it did not have before if there are no physical differences then there is no difference did you not do science at school or something there is an important concept in science that basically states if you cannot tell two things apart then they are identical
663804 just the mere thought of desecrating the holy eucharist is enough to get one into hell
663805 the out of control catholic spam on this thread is a good example of their fake morality
663806 interesting apparently you view richard dawkins book as a holy text
663807 oh feck now im gonna go to hell bwahahaha well i sure as hell wouldnt want to spend an eternity in feckin heaven with those crazy christians feckin religious edjits
663808 nothing you say will convince me otherwise because it is true
663809 spamming on the other hand is actively disrupting communication and if you are doing it you can kiss my ass
663810 it is important for catholics to know that the university of minnesota will not tolerate the deliberate destruction of the eucharist by one of its faculty just as african americans would not tolerate the burning of a cross and jews would not tolerate the display of swastikas catholics will not tolerate the desecration of the eucharist
663811 you have no arguments you can only cover your ears and scream
663812 i shub niggurath the black goat of the woods with a thousand young
663813 when all the howling gnashing of teeth pontification and squealing is done tis just a cracker live with it
663814 the atheistic nazis killing 6 million jews and 10 million others
663815 i think if i were truly evil i would have to demand that all of my acolytes be celibate but would turn a blind eye to any sexual depravities they might commit if i wanted to be an evil hypocrite id drape myself in expensive jeweled robes and live in an ornate palace while telling all my followers that poverty is a virtue if i wanted to commit world class evil id undermine efforts at family planning by the poor especially if i could simultaneously enable the spread of deadly diseases and if i wanted to be so evil that i would commit a devastating crime against the whole of the human race twisting the minds of children into ignorance and hatred i would be promoting the indoctrination of religion in childrens upbringing and fomenting hatred against anyone who dared speak out in defiance
663816 simply because a handful of homosexual priests broke their vows
663817 everyone wants to go to heaven nobodys in a hurry to get there
663818 what is truth said jesting pilate and would not stay for an answer
663819 okay well let you live but only if you pass a test the first part of the test is to go out into the jungle and collect ten pieces of fruit ill tell you the second part when you get back
663820 okay good job now heres the second part of the test if you can shove all ten of those apples up your ass and keep a straight face you get to live otherwise we kill you

663824 i knew the first thing that would happen is that the loons would claim it is a fake cracker the one i chose to photograph is one that the sender actually provided video documentation of where it came from
663825 i am part of the church and i believe in what it teaches and we are all one in christ
663826 i am part of an criminal organization and i support and encourage its criminal intentions and activities and we are all one in dangerous delusion
663827 take eat this is a symbol of my body take drink this is a symbol of my blood do this as a ritual to remind yourselves of me and the things i have done and will do for you
663828 what a bad thing for the guy to do but the girl was asking for it
663829 i think humans invented religion because they took drugs and saw things they could not explain
663830 hell laughed indeed did god hurt im sure god wouldnt burn in hell but you have chosen to be hahahahahaha you are not posting my comment huh wheres your son tonite
663831 all in all the gesture was as pointless as a man shitting in his own yard it might be unsightly to the neighbors but the stink is yours alone to behold
663832 wait i believed what hmm maybe that is a bit silly
663833 nobody has to believe it is the body of christ for the act of consecration is a public act perfomed by a catholic priest
663834 if theyre spamming you with papal encyclicals you know you must be doing something right
663835 pz said nothing must be held sacred question everything even evolution

663842 by the way heres an fyi for those who blame aids on the catholic church if everyone in the world followed catholic teaching on chastity aids would not exist so if you want to put an end to aids just convince everyone in the world to convert to catholicism and get all of the liberal catholics to return to orthodoxy
663843 opposition to birth control divorce abortion stem cell research all of which are irrational deeply immoral and do materially affect me
663844 first they came for the crackers and i said nothing since i was not a cracker
663845 it does make a difference to people who are on the fence with losing their faith
663846 wait i believed what hmm maybe that is a bit silly
663847 btw if you are catholic and i am atheist does that make me evil nicole and if so do i have to grow a goatee
663848 if we follow your analogy any non christians including atheists who committed brutal acts in the year 1215 or otherwise should be punished today in 2008
663849 the cracker will be kept wrapped in a condom until the catholic church recognises the legitimacy of the golden rule
663850 by the way heres an fyi for those who blame aids on the catholic church if everyone in the world followed catholic teaching on chastity aids would not exist so if you want to put an end to aids just convince everyone in the world to convert to catholicism and get all of the liberal catholics to return to orthodoxy
663851 you should have recycled everything or at least recycled the nail and added the paper coffee banana etc to your back yard composter
663852 i would have others respect my right to privately practice my religion or lack thereof the way i see fit and not go out of their way to interfere with it
663853 isaac does not regard every idea as equally deserving since he clearly considers the atheist idea that the sacraments of his faith are empty foolishness to be an outrage rather what he loves is the idea that everyone else must respect his beliefs no matter what they are and that any disagreement is an insult
663854 i pierced it the host with a rusty nail i hope jesuss tetanus shots are up to date and then i simply threw it in the trash
663855 they are just paper nothing must be held sacred his emphasis question everything god is not great jesus is not your lord you are not disciples of any charismatic prophet
663856 the university must now take action and apply the appropriate sanction
663857 it is important for catholics to know that the university of minnesota will not tolerate the deliberate destruction of the eucharist by one of its faculty just as african americans would not tolerate the burning of a cross and jews would not tolerate the display of swastikas catholics will not tolerate the desecration of the eucharist
663858 please show me the flaw in my argument if everyone practiced chastity outside of marriage we wouldnt have aids this is undeniably true
663859 i have followed the church in giving our party program the character of unalterable finality like the creed the church has never allowed the creed to be interfered with it is fifteen hundred years since it was formulated but every suggestion for its amendment every logical criticism or attack on it has been rejected the church has realized that anything and everything can be built up on a document of that sort no matter how contradictory or irreconcilable with it the faithful will swallow it whole so long as logical reasoning is never allowed to be brought to bear on it
663860 hitler has reported several incidents during the war which proved to him that he was under divine protection the page 11 most startling of these is the following
663861 i was eating my dinner in a trench with several comrades suddenly a voice seemed to be saying to me get up and go over there it was so clear and insistent that i obeyed automatically as if it had been a military order i rose at once to my feet and walked twenty yards along the trench carrying my dinner in its tin can with me then i sat down to go on eating my mind being once more at rest hardly had i done so when a flash and deafening report came from the part of the trench i had just left a stray shell had burst over the group in which i had been sitting and every member of it was killed
663862 no power on earth can shake the german reich now divine providence has willed it that i carry through the fulfillment of the germanic task
663863 when i came to berlin a few weeks ago and looked at the traffic in the kurfuerstendamm the luxury the perversion the iniquity the wanton display and the jewish materialism disgusted me so thoroughly that i was almost beside myself i nearly imagined myself to be jesus christ when he came to his fathers temple and found it taken by the money changers i can well imagine how he felt when he seized a whip and scourged them out
663864 omygod im 20 years old and havent had sex yet and i cant until im married and i cant wait any longer
663865 yet there appears to be none from th coffee grounds on
663866 of course i guess it doesnt matter if you take your authoritys word for it unquestioned for those of us who are real scientists that is anathema
663867 thats a pretty despicable defense of lies and false testimony
663868 if everyone in the world followed sane medical teaching on using condoms aids would not exist so if you want to put an end to aids just convince everyone in the world to use condoms
663869 they say theres a heaven for those who will wait some say its better but i say it aint id rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints sinners are much more fun only the good die young
663870 by the way probably unintentionally this rises to the level of visionary religious art i want to buy a print and donate the money to victims of religious violence
663871 be cheerful jesus will take care of everything let us pay no attention to people who do not know what they are talking about let us trust in jesus and our heavenly mother and everything will work out well
663872 if everyone practiced chastity outside of marriage we wouldnt have aids this is undeniably true
663873 apparently theyre an object of worship for many of your acolytes
663874 to open a restaurant selling the holy body of our creator to infidels equals kidnapping and extortion
663875 it shows a lack of respect for our holiest of all religions
663876 father forgive them for they know not what they do
663877 all dogs are canines a pug is a dog therefore a pug is a vegetable
663878 it seems a whole lot more like paul is being a demagogue for his own personal attention
663879 i wont mince words myers is an evil man and as evil men particularly evil intellectuals tend to be he is also a mad man as are most of his acolytes and followers
663880 please show me the flaw in my argument if everyone practiced chastity outside of marriage we wouldnt have aids this is undeniably true
663881 in fact i bet that just reading that last sentence turned a number of you on sexually
663882 i have carved out a certain area of my life where i choose superstition and medieval beliefs over everything that reason tells me and im going to do that no matter what my senses or my mind demonstrates to me because it makes me feel good

663884 cracker without it fragmenting the communion hots sic are very brittle as anyone familiar with them knows
663885 the victims shouldnt have been selfish and damaged the church the way they did

663888 cracker without it fragmenting the communion hots sic are very brittle as anyone familiar with them knows
663889 because he thought it was good sport because some men are not looking for anything logical like money they cant be bought bullied reasoned or negotiated with some men just want to watch the world burn
663890 a little less convinced about some things than the rest of us
663891 i dont know about other atheists in these blogs but what bothers me are the catholic s who came here and minimized what the scandal
663892 the victims shouldnt have been selfish and damaged the church the way they did
663893 the cardinal and i were otherwise occupied last night enjoying the youth festival so we didnt see the lateline story all ive seen is the reports in the newspapers today happily i think most of australia was enjoying and delighting in the beauty and goodness of these young people and the hope for us doing these sorts of things better in the future as we saw last night rather than dwelling crankily as a few people are doing on old wounds
663894 im attempting to convert can someone post me a link to a christian blog
663895 pz said nothing must be held sacred question everything even evolution
663896 as a christian it is an insult for anyone to call my beliefs stupid shit i have respected every religion and every idea for years
663897 interesting that a nail was used for this whether this was a conscious play on the crucifixion or not it goes to show that christian imagery lingers in the mind long after christian faith has been denied
663898 would i post here if i cared what atheists thought of me
663899 those things are meaningless to them for them there is no meaning human beings have no intrinsic worth so in a way you encourage death threats by your own philosophy
663900 if she didnt want to be raped she shouldnt have been dressed that way
663901 you deserve to die for this you are lucky that catholicism unlike islam is not a violent religion nonetheless watch your back
663902 you must be very hurt and angry but lucky for us our lord is all good and mercy
663903 god is infinitely just but merciful and so no more than myers sincere repentance at any time during his future life will be needed to ultimately erase this event out of history for him and god
663904 its rather the kind of madness that appears in ripping the drawing of a three year old from his parents fridge and tearing it to shreds because its
663905 i know its so funny you get humans when theyre young you tell them with a deeply solemn voice and a straight face the silliest thing imaginable you keep telling them the silly thing day in and day out year after year and when they get a little older they will scream with outrage if someone acts as though the silly thing isnt true
663906 why dont you pick on my crazy brother islam hell kick your ass
663907 serious question why do so many of you assume that we catholics were not outraged by the sexual abuse scandal the sexual abuse of children is extremely evil the catholic church must continue to work to put an end to these atrocities committed by supposed men of god and do whatever it can to help the victims
663908 i think society in general was a little rough in the middle ages not just the catholic church i think people have gotten much more civilized over the centuries most of us have anyway youre obviously still a brutish uncivilized dumb ass
663909 nothing must be held sacred question everything god is not great jesus is not your lord you are not disciples of any charismatic prophet you are all human beings who must make your way through your life by thinking and learning and you have the job of advancing humanitys knowledge by winnowing out the errors of past generations and finding deeper understanding of reality
663910 im agressively stupid and dont know what im talking about
663911 it is far better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt
663912 it is far better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt
663913 many generations ago there were so many different believers in various messiahs that one has to wonder how come christianity and islam and hinduism were selected for successful propagation over their many competitors
663914 thank you your blatant disrespect and ignorance have encouraged me to increase the humble practice of my faith thanks to you i am now a daily communicant and intend fully to pray the rosary and remember you at mass debi
663915 oh sandis back again yay man youre a frigging idiot sandi but you know i really do feel sorry for you you just have no idea how much youre missing out on in life

663917 hey myers thanks for ranting about the catholic church in the year 1215 did you know were now in the year 2008 maybe you didnt get the memo ive heard of long grudges but this is ridiculous maybe youre compensating for your shortcomings in other areas tee hee
663918 you actually think threatening a wafer is the same as threatening or insulting a human being
663919 boy are you gonna get it when dad gets home
663920 it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it
663921 verily i say unto you should an atheist strike you on the left cheek yellest thou loudly at him and raise your voice unto the heavens for his firing shalt thou loudly cry out yea verily also shalt thou threaten his life callest thou all those who do not agree with you morons mock and ridicule them
663922 did you think atheists dont believe that people are responsible for their actions
663923 you have the opportunity to agree with me and not be tortured
663924 the eucharist and see for yourself or plug in l ron hubbard instead of bill donohue or the pope see joyous
663925 evolution is true the bibles a lie gods a ghost
663926 it is not the business of government in our nation to suppress real or imagined attacks upon a particular religious doctrine whether they appear in publications speeches or motion pictures
663927 now any catholics who are capable of seeing the stupidity for what it is have probably already left the church or maybe this little flap will be the deciding factor for some
663928 what has become obvious is that some of you need to believe that an athiest can not become a happy healthy productive and upstanding person on their own that would be a direct assault on your beliefs and so you reject the notion completely
663929 you are truly an evil man and i pray for your soul harming the holy eucharist and jesus body is the most terrible thing one can do and you did it i pray for your conversion
663930 i read an article by a vicar recently who said
663931 woe anyone who would cause one of these little ones to go astray it would be better for them if a millstone were tied around their neck and they were cast into the sea
663932 let the little ones come to me for of such as these are the kingdom of heaven
663933 i cant believe you are a man of god and served in the military and were caught yes he said caught doing this
663934 i am saddened and sickened by your blatant disrespect for others beliefs as well as your mistreatment of christ in the most holy sacrament of the altar especially on thursday the day devoted to the eucharist you will remain in my prayers for a long time may god have mercy on your soul i should not want to be you at the moment of your death
663935 starting today go ahead and eat all the meat you want on friday you wont go to hell for it
663936 he doesnt know the humble god of the universe who he seeks to desecrate posted by dina624
663937 as an aside my father was abused by his priest the local candy store owner a man who also was catholic and his aunt whose family including my grandparents were strict catholics go figure that out
663938 trying to endanger childrens lives is not the same as upsetting people by dissing their religious beliefs i know that to you they are the same
663939 at the end of the event as he staggered sweating and red faced out of the room he hitchens advanced on father rutler in a threatening and physical manner screaming that this beloved pastor and brilliant scholar whom he had never met was a child molester and a lazy layabout who never did a days work in his life his behavior was so frightening that a bodyguard put himself between hitchens and father rutler to protect him several of the event organizers then escorted hitchens to the mens room and when he emerged he continued his psychotic rant repeating the same calumnious and baseless screed as before
663940 thanks for the history lesson pz it amazes me to think that this whole eucharist thing started back with the fourth lateran council of 1215 and involved so much ugly hatred i know i had never heard of them before
663941 bluster splutter well of course i dont condone posting information that could possibly put innocents in danger but gee he had it coming and he kind of asked for it and and and
663942 i feel bad for you as well you really are missing out on alot in life have fun depriving yourself
663943 lisa has it almost right it means nothing except im guessing she doesnt really think that i mean having fun in life means nothing too and yet she thinks its important
663944 you deserve to die for this you are lucky that catholicism unlike islam is not a violent religion nonetheless watch your back posted by inquisitor
663945 1658 he offended and upset and hurt many people by doing what he did just like yelling nigger at a black person is offensive no property is taken in that situation either what jesse jackson said off mike the other day about barrack obama was offensive he used the n word
663946 john you do realize that the point of fish on friday isnt sacrifice right a corrupt pope made that edict after getting bribed by fishermen
663947 may the lord have mercy on the cracker and may god forgive you because i wont
663948 i am now as before a catholic and will always remain so
663949 look at me world and look at how much i hate catholics
663950 trying to endanger childrens lives is not the same as upsetting people by dissing their religious beliefs i know that to you they are the same
663951 professor myers is entitled to his own religious beliefs but not his own facts the belief in the eucharist existed hundreds of years before 1215
663952 lisa all abuse is wrong but to hate an entire class of people because of the actions of a few
663953 hes your savior and lord too whether you believe it or not
663954 they think it is impossible for human beings to avoid having sex with multiple partners in other words they disbelieve in free will
663955 professor myers is entitled to his own religious beliefs but not his own facts the belief in the eucharist existed hundreds of years before 1215
663956 during the concert of the beatles here almost everyone attended the said concert and after the concert they could not believe the great crowd before them so one of them shouted
663957 what he professor myers claims to have done is insofar as it is a highly publicized act a gratuitous disturbance of the social order and of the emotional peace of a good many people
663958 the punishment of those who wage war against allah and his messenger and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is execution or crucifixion or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides or exile from the land that is their disgrace in this world and a heavy punishment is theirs in the hereafter
663959 the only reward of those who make war upon allah and his messenger and strive after corruption in the land will be that they will be killed or crucified or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off or will be expelled out of the land such will be their degradation in the world and in the hereafter theirs will be an awful doom
663960 the punishment of those who wage war against allah and his messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement
663961 weird is this tg also a 911 truther theres nothing remarkable about getting a communion wafer and tossing it in the trash
663962 but i tell you who hear me love your enemies do good to those who hate you bless those who curse you pray for those who mistreat you if someone strikes you on one cheek turn to him the other also
663963 why because some kid disturbed a catholic ritual a mass and took a host to piss off the catholics at that mass so the professor went on a holy crusade to also desecrate a host to show his support of the offending student who caused a scene at the mass
663964 tg do you expect to get a video feed of everything that happened to the cracker from sunday mass to wednesday trash with no breaks or edits its not going to happen so youre just wanking
663965 in psychology cognitive dissonance is an uncomfortable feeling or stress caused by holding two contradictory ideas simultaneously the theory of cognitive dissonance proposes that people have a fundamental cognitive drive to reduce this dissonance by modifying an existing belief or rejecting one of the contradictory ideas
663966 often one of the ideas is a fundamental element of ego like
663967 but a well documented chain of custody might be something in the way of evidence
663968 i descrated both but look how only one causes an irrational outrage consider what that means
663969 and making life miserable for some guy just because he didnt worship it the way he was supposed to
663970 the only person who thinks pz is in any sort of pickle is you as seen by your incessant pointless paranoid ranting and squawking
663971 thanks for giving us your take on the year 1215 did you know were now in the year 2008
663972 no one is forcing you to believe in god to believe in the eucharist
663973 sure no one is forcing you to be heterosexual but if you dont act like it you wont ever make a living and your life will be in danger
663974 if you actually recall the start of this saga it came about because that belief led to a student being assaulted by members of the church and death threats from catholics world wide
663975 his intentions are clear he is specifically attacking and mocking only catholics for their beliefs concerning the host
663976 the golden rule is based on love of neighbor not hate of neighbor what this guy did is in no way an application of the golden rule it is nothing but hate being purposely put on display
663977 am i the only one that got the monty python spanish inquisition skit reference
663978 since when did i say that people who act like assholes are the
663979 i descrated both but look how only one causes an irrational outrage consider what that means
663980 anyway because i see a belief in the supernatural as a silly waste of time i am somehow now letting pz do my thinking for me
663981 his intentions are clear he is specifically attacking and mocking only catholics for their beliefs concerning the host
663982 tg if its such a big attack on all catholics wheres the pope reassuring the faithful
663983 i know its just a cracker its just a cow its just a rabbits foot its just a paper with green ink on it with a portrait of a president and the number 100 but if other people value these material objects whether for religious reasons or not then let them alone for fucks sake theyre not harming you posted by cw
663984 he despises catholics how do you know how far he would go to get rid of them
663985 tg has finally revealed his true colours and his love of huffing furniture polish
663986 he despises catholics how do you know how far he would go to get rid of them
663987 how are they not harming me are they not harming me by taking away my freedom of reproductive choice or are they not harming me by wanting to take away my right to marry another woman im canadian so i currently have those rights despite their most ardent and very vocal objections and as long as they want to strip me of those rights i will just as vocally point out the ridiculousness of their religion and rites rights vs rites seems fair to me but thats just me theres also the millions of people worldwide being harmed by their insistence along with other sects and religions that condom use be left out of the fight against aids and hiv this religion like most other major religions is causing very real very serious harm in todays world so excuse me for not respecting their frackin cracker
663988 pz you should eat your bananas before they turn brown
663989 but his actions in holding a host hostage are beyond irrational
663990 a wedding band tombstone children etc are important and or sentimental so is a cracker but in this case some people worship the cracker holding it sacred mind you this is a violation of the prohibition against idolatry but catholics arent been so good at that anyway
663991 dear honored mullah and esteemed prophet of allah may he bless your camels its been a while since ive written but i just wanted to say sorry about that whole muhammed teddy bear thing and the muhammed cartoon thing and those 2nd 3rd and 6th crusades anyway just wanted to ask a quick favor all my friends are declaring holy jihad on the unbeliever pz myers and we wanted to invite you along hope to see you there love your pal bill donoghue ps you know we were just kidding with all that mean stuff we said about nuking you all after 911
663992 er joe your believers have likened this to rape kidnapping and murder and have threatened violence of a similar level to people for doing it
663993 do you honestly consider this kids stupid stunt whatever his motivations were to be every bit as insane as wanting to physically harm or kill a person
663994 if you do joe then youre exactly the sort of person who pzs actions are intended to reveal
663995 i am not even convinced that he should lose his job over this
663996 oh yeah well catholics are stupid but youre just trying to get famous ergo you suck
663997 they are all demonstrably more than they are its more than
663998 but his actions in holding a host hostage are beyond rational
663999 from the most foul well of indifferentism flows that absurd and erroneous opinion or rather delirium of liberty of conscience
664000 hogwash there are gay catholics and pro choice catholics you strike me as another oblivious one dimensional pseudo skeptic whos only rubbed shoulders with the lunatics of one particular religion and you never bother to think beyond the impression they gave you so therefore the whole religion is a danger to you right poor you you cant go out at night because evil catholic vampires with chainsaws will hunt you down and inquire into your sex life yeah its really that dangerous posted by cw
664001 whos only rubbed shoulders with the lunatics of one particular religion
664002 a more fitting analogy would be if pz had been given a microgram or picogram of your wifes ashes
664003 unfortunately it will be at the expense of himself rather the unfortunate part is that this knucklehead did it when he has a family to take care of i want you to all watch how a man lets his ego get ahead of his responsibilities to his wife and child
664004 he could just put out a book and it would fly off the shelves
664005 we borrow a lot of our attitudes along with a lot of our hymns and not always the best of either
664006 its interesting to note that those people the first scientists were all monks they were all clerics
664007 you do know that pz has the ip you used to post each and every one of these
664008 i gave thinking for myself a try and came to the inescapable conclusion that you are a complete and utter tool
664009 a difference of dress distinguishes jews or saracens from christians in some provinces but in others a certain confusion has developed so that they are indistinguishable whence it sometimes happens that by mistake christians join with jewish or saracen women and jews or saracens with christian women
664010 let me see if i have this right you do something for the sole purpose of pissing off catholics
664011 nothing must be held sacred question everything god is not great jesus is not your lord you are not disciples of any charismatic prophet you are all human beings who must make your way through your life by thinking and learning and you have the job of advancing humanitys knowledge by winnowing out the errors of past generations and finding deeper understanding of reality you will not find wisdom in rituals and sacraments and dogma which build only self satisfied ignorance but you can find truth by looking at your world with fresh eyes and a questioning mind
664012 so someones hand being grabbed by a senior citizen is now
664013 if you really believed in jesus wouldnt you be following in his footsteps
664014 congratulations pz on an eloquent gesture and thank you for including the pages from the god delusion its only a book if i had any doubts about the rightness of what you did they were dispelled by reading the fatuous pathetic ignominious abjectly stupid protests of catholics writing in protest either they really believe the wafer is jesus in which case they are idiots or they dont in which case they are hypocritical hysterics either way they deserve to be insulted congratulations on doing so bravo pz richard
664015 aided and abetted by well known secret sects satanic groups and new age movements
664016 yes i do here you can have it too 70 7 120 67 sprint cellular
664017 and he was carried in his own hands but brethren how is it possible for a man to do this who can understand it who is it that is carried in his own hands a man can be carried in the hands of another but no one can be carried in his own hands how this should be understood literally of david we cannot discover but we can discover how it was meant of christ for christ was carried in his own hands when referring to his own body he said this is my body for he carried that body in his hands
664018 for the conversion of all heretics schismatics lebertines atheists blasphemers sorcerers idolaters
664019 the vision of fatima concerns above all the war waged by atheist systems against the church and christians and it describes the immense suffering endured by the witnesses to the faith in the last century of the second millennium it is an interminable way of the cross led by the popes of the twentieth century
664020 thats right zach silence all who disagree with you coward
664021 is what is moral commanded by god because it is moral or is it moral because it is commanded by god
664022 the first horn of the dilemma i e that which is moral is commanded by god because it is moral implies that morality is independent of god and indeed that god is bound by morality just as his creatures are god then becomes little more than a passer on of moral knowledge
664023 the second horn of the dilemma i e that which is moral is moral because it is commanded by god known as divine command theory runs into three main problems first it implies that what is good is arbitrary based merely upon gods whim if god had created the world to include the values that rape murder and torture were virtues while mercy and charity were vices then they would have been secondly it implies that calling god good makes no non tautological sense or at best that one is simply saying that god is consistent and not hypocritical thirdly it involves a form of reasoning that g e moore classified as a naturalistic fallacy to explain the claim that murder is wrong or the prescription that one should not commit murder in terms of what god has or hasnt said is to argue from what moore classified as a putative fact about the world to what moore classified as a value see is ought problem
664024 the golden rule is based on love of neighbor not hate of neighbor what this guy did is in no way an application of the golden rule it is nothing but hate being purposely put on display
664025 fallacies do not cease to be fallacies because they become fashions
664026 some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again
664027 if there were no god there would be no atheists
664028 thats the kid who predicted wwii after it started right wow
664029 ironically fool you are the one that is wrong 1215 is accepted as the historical beginning of the eucharist
664030 the food which has been made into the eucharist by the eucharistic prayer set down by him and by the change of which our blood and flesh is nourished is both the flesh and the blood of that incarnated jesus
664031 let the bishop give the oblation saying the body of christ and let him that receiveth say amen and let the deacon take the cup and when he gives it say the blood of christ the cup of life and let him that drinketh say amen
664032 thats the kid who predicted wwii after it started right wow
664033 what amazes me is that you have put so much effort into something that you dont even believes exists i myself do not believe in unicorns but it would never occur to me to stab one with a rusty nail nor risk my reputation trying to debunk their existence me thinks thou dost protest too much
664034 this is not a unicorn horn its just a cracker

664038 im lean so i cramp at times when i dont hydrate good enough
664039 we think michael johnson can maybe have a breakout year
664040 certainly physically hes got all the tools you would want
664041 sometimes he may have been missing only one down in a series
664042 there were a lot of times when i was the starter but mike played more snaps in a series than i did
664043 i wouldnt say he doesnt have experience it was just a different type of running he has to prepare for during second or third down you will not get the type of smash mouth running instead more of the zone type running
664044 were going to come out in different fronts and different formations
664045 were not going to be predictable at all were going to have people guessing sometimes well come out with three down linemen sometimes four

664051 you guys are beautiful mr ed obrien on guit yall
664052 wenn ich aber von vorneherein jeden ausschlie e der nicht hundertprozentig auf dem boden des grundgesetzes steht dann kann ich es gleich lassen
664053 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
664054 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
664055 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
664056 i really do believe these could be the best years of my playing career and i can go on and score plenty of runs
664057 it is a difficult job but a fantastic job but not many people get to do it which is a real privilege ive loved every minute of it
664058 its a big disappointment not getting through until next year but theres no point carrying on when you know its time to go
664059 michael led from the front and led with honesty and integrity every step of the way
664060 he took the england captaincy to new heights michael was the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the character he instilled in the dressing room
664061 i am very disappointed for michael vaughan and for england because i thought he was an excellent captain and leader
664062 i said on my radio show last week that i thought he should stay on as england captain
664063 he is a terrific player and like collingwood is probably only one innings away from resurrecting his form
664064 the timing is never right when to resign but it tends to be when you have lost a series i think that pressure from outside has built up sufficient for him to say enough is enough
664065 to finish with a birdie was a little bit extra
664066 i kept it together pretty well today but i was emotional on the first tee and coming up the final few holes
664067 i was pleased to play well and score in the 60s i just wish the birdie putt at the last had been for the championship
664068 i saw a sign on the scoreboard saying annika youll be missed and then i was greeted with all the applause
664069 its been 15 great years of golf and i just really enjoyed the moment it was also nice to share it with my caddie terry mcnamara weve been together for nine years and we are great friends so i wanted him to enjoy it too

664096 politics is a combative industry if you want something youve got to put your hand up and go for it
664097 we are all saying what a terrific bloke he is what a fantastic talent he is how much we miss him we love him we want him
664098 deep anxiety about his costellos ability to govern for ordinary australians
664099 the perception is that the people who are being deported are maniacal homicidal and rapist criminals
664100 in many cases theyre green card holders theyre the family down the street
664101 the bottom line is illegal aliens will not come here if there are no jobs waiting for them
664102 they will not stay here if there is no government subsidy and they certainly wont stay here if they know that if they ever encounter our state and local law enforcement officers they will be physically detained until they are deported
664103 the next question to ask would be whether citizens have taken jobs that illegals used to do
664104 though the lower unemployment rate doesnt in and of itself prove that it does point strongly in that direction
664105 its absurd that theyre working alone we should unite together
664106 they have a lot of power but we have children its unjust
664107 we need more people in government who are hispanic and mexican
664108 the anglo saxons i guess are preferable for the united states
664109 the kid without the three fingers and the one with his hand
664110 the idea came about when my daughters friend needed dental work but there was a 12 month waiting list
664111 it has to be run every year its disgraceful in a country as wealthy as australia
664112 the aim is to try and make a dent in the waiting lists
664113 i commend the dentists who do the work but its not acceptable that any government think the problem is solved
664114 its given them a lazy way out its not a solution
664115 he sculled the first bottle and then some people were egging him on to scull the next one
664116 police have taken samples of the alcohol they were drinking and just want to find out what was in it
664117 hes not quite six foot and hes probably 15 stone id say i was pretty close to my son
664118 he wasnt really into sports hes more into playing on the computer and things like that
664119 we used to talk over the phone or wed meet in the street or go car racing im into racing cars and hes always been there as my pit crew
664120 in this case what police are investigating is that he has died unusually or unexpectedly after attending a party all detectives can say is hed been at a party and had been drinking
664121 it will devastate any small country town and its bound to be quite devastating for virtually everyone
664122 you will find that everyone knew him in some way or another
664123 we unfortunately have a culture among many young people to drink to get drunk and many people believe the more you drink the more popular you will be

664157 this is how i choose to express myself and symbolically show how i am feeling through lyrics
664158 all the circumstances have been proved by the prosecution and lead to the irresistible conclusion that the accused subjected the foreigner to gang rape and killed her after robbing her of valuables
664159 those battles were meant to erase our presence in the gaza strip
664160 when you have palestinians being forced to flee by other palestinians it is a tragedy
664161 hamas might win the battle but this behaviour makes it so much harder to win international support to create an independent state this is the behaviour of a brutal dictatorship not a political party working towards advancing the interests of its people
664162 i have one simple wish that my speeches and opinions can appear in chinese newspapers television and on radio

664164 its a mystery why it is afraid of the sunshine and not the darkness
664165 then they said 2070 and then they said 2050 and then they said 2030
664166 not only do i see the change but its like theyre moving the goalposts toward me and its an amazing thing
664167 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
664168 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
664169 as near as we can tell looking at the historical record theres been ice in the arctic in the summer for at least 16 million years
664170 theres a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 well have an ice free summer arctic as soon as that its astounding whats happened
664171 as the ice recedes its opening up not only the arctic passage but all the resources in the arctic ocean
664172 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
664173 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
664174 the arctic really can feed back into the global climate system
664175 you know what happens when you get feedbacks you get surprises and we dont like surprises
664176 a race has developed between the waning sunlight and the weakened ice
664177 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
664178 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
664179 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
664180 we should care in the sense that what happens here is coming to us and sometimes you know a warning is a helpful thing to mobilise people
664181 this race and this country and this life produced me he said i shall express myself as i am
664182 hey gadge why not wait until a jet plane flies overhead
664183 can either of you think of something that you might be doing something that might motivate the jeering
664184 my daddy was a traveling salesman and whenever i used to wait for him in the car he would always bring me an ice cream cone
664185 it will make archie lee feel silly and doubly humiliated having to cross in front of the guys with a dripping ice cream cone it is a perfect childish prop for you ill shoot archie lees reactions and those of the crowd as you lick the cone and well have our sexual connotations there too
664186 im afraid we will have to shoot it right now or else postpone it until tomorrow because the light is going
664187 we cant wait for you any longer carroll never mind well do the scene without tears
664188 the zionist regime is not strong and the states can obtain their rights through resistance and determination
664189 syria is working to embolden its relations with tehran and is determined to maintain its cooperation and coordination with iran
664190 the liberation of all occupied lands the return of the palestinian refugees the establishment of a palestinian state and the collapse of the zionist regime are not considered by the regions nations to be goals that are unattainable
664191 lebanon its army its people and its resistance hezbollah have the right to take action to liberate lands that have remained occupied at the shaba farms the hills of shuba village and the northern portion of the village of ghajar with all legitimate means possible and to resist israeli aggression
664192 the countdown for the restoration of the shaba farms and the hills of shuba village has begun all means are possible and legitimate to this end
664193 you get back out there and jump right back in the middle of it and make better pitches than you did the night before its a cliche and all that but you just want to get back out there and finish off the game
664194 anytime they walk the guy in front of you to face you its kind of a slap in the face
664195 all you can do is pitch as well as you can no matter who the coach is
664196 its just frustrating to see him pitching that well and have me come in here and lose the game
664197 i timed it right and it went right into my glove i didnt know i caught it i just closed my eyes looked in my glove and was excited i caught it

664218 differences in small animals are much more subtle and so are frequently over looked
664219 the great thing is that dna is as different between two small snakes as it is between two large snakes allowing us to see the differences that we cant see by eye
664220 this is unusual for snakes but seems to be a feature of small animals
664221 if a tiny snake were to have more than one offspring each egg would have to share the same space occupied by the one egg and so the two hatchlings would be half the normal size

664226 giving comprehensible and appropriate information about survival benefit is extremely difficult however the reluctance to address these difficulties and sensitivities may be hampering patients ability to make informed decisions about their future treatment
664227 id like all patients with incurable cancer to have the information they need to make a decision about whether to have this treatment
664228 but this needs nationally agreed and regularly updated statistics and earlier conversations with their doctor about the pros and cons of treatment in the last month
664229 at the moment much depends on the doctor you see
664230 this small but interesting study sheds some light on the particular difficulties in communicating information about palliative chemotherapy treatment decisions

664238 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
664239 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
664240 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
664241 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
664242 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
664243 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up

664279 wir leisteten gestern im qualifying keine ausreichend gute arbeit dies hat uns im rennen geschadet wir k mpften damit die notwendige geschwindigkeit zu finden und es fiel uns schwer mit den toyota und renault mitzuhalten gegen die wir in der meisterschaft k mpfen lasst uns hoffen dass es die strecke ist und wir in valencia wieder zur ckschlagen k nnen
664280 ungl cklicherweise kam ich vor meinem letzten stopp in etwas verkehr was es nick heidfeld erlaubte mich zu berholen
664281 abgesehen davon konnte ich heute nicht mehr tun das auto hatte starkes bersteuern und das heck rutschte herum nun werden wir uns einfach auf das kommende rennen konzentrieren und schauen was wir dort tun k nnen
664282 ungl cklicherweise waren wir einfach nicht schnell genug und dies war ein kurs der uns nicht in die karten spielt unsere dichtesten gegner konnten heute beide respektabel punkten aber wir werden intensiv druck machen um den verlorenen boden in den verbleibenden rennen gut zu machen
664283 i just tried to put pressure on massa hoping something would happen

664285 il non aver differenziato i centri di entrata rispetto a quelli di spesa con laggravante dei trasferimenti statali legati alla spesa storica e non ai costi standard ha determinato non solo unesplosione della spesa pubblica ma anche il venir meno della trasparenza della resposanbilizzazione di chi amministra e del controllo democratico da parte dei cittadini sui propri amministratori nonch un aumento dellevasione fiscale

664287 instead of evacuating our injured they used the ambulances in order to lead additional soldiers to the area
664288 they fired at us with guns mortar shells and rpg i was injured during the first hour and began bleeding but prevented the ambulances from reaching us
664289 i was injured when the clashes began i tried to reach the hospital in gaza but they told us the road was closed and prevented our ambulances from travelling there my brother drove me to the terminal where i waited until they let us in

664299 the establishment of the economic world state by the deliberate invitation explicit discussion and cooperation of the men most interested in economic organization men chosen by their work called to it by a natural disposition and aptitude for it fully aware of its importance and working with the support of an increasing general understanding it is not a project to overthrow existing governments by insurrectionary attacks but to supersede them by disregard it does not want to destroy them or alter their forms but to make them negligible by replacing their functions it will respect them as far as it must what is useful of them it will use what is useless it will efface by its stronger reality it will join issue only with what is plainly antagonistic and actively troublesome

664305 the open conspiracy will appear first i believe as a conscious organization of intelligent and in some cases wealthy men as a movement having distinct social and political aims confessedly ignoring most of the existing apparatus of political control or using it only as an incidental implement in the stages a mere movement of a number of people in a certain direction who will presently discover with a sort of surprise the common object toward which they are all moving in all sorts of ways they will be influencing and controlling the ostensible government
664306 from the outset the open conspiracy will set its face against militarism
664307 refusal to serve in any war as conscientious objectors for the furtherance of its aims the open conspiracy may work in alliance with all sorts of movements and people and restricted movements will attend only to a portion of its program
664308 branching and development with the open conspiracy as consisting of a great multitude and variety of overlapping groups but now all organized for collective political social and educational as well as propagandist action they will recognize each other much more clearly than they did at first and they will have acquired a common name the character of the open conspiracy will now be plainly displayed it will have become a great world movement as widespread and evident as socialism and communism it will largely have taken the place of these movements it will be more it will be a world religion this large loose assimilatory mass of groups and societies will be definitely and obviously attempting to swallow up the entire population of the world and become the new human community
664309 as civilization becomes more complex and as the need for invisible government has been increasingly demonstrated the technical means have been invented and developed by which public opinion may be regimented with printing press and newspaper the telephone telegraph radio and airplanes ideas can be spread rapidly and even instantaneously across the whole of america

664334 if we all work together now our plan might work
664335 weve basically sat around talking for the last hour and we still have no idea what weve been talking about so in order to explain to our superiors where weve been for all this time lets use the next 30 seconds to pound out a few bullet points that we can neatly put into an email for distribution
664336 none of the people talking right now really knows what were saying so to save us further embarrassment in front of our peers lets publicly state that we are going to discuss this topic at another time while silently agreeing to never speak of it again

664341 weve made some decisions for the good of the business in accordance with our strategic plan
664342 were about to lay off a lot of people so hold off on making any big purchases because youre probably better off holding on to your money right now but in the meantime well let you twist in the wind while capitalizing on your fear of being fired by asking you to work an obscene amount of hours
664343 we used to say if you buy our product well give you a good deal and something for free like a toaster or something

664348 jo vi fik en klump i halsen da vi fik landkending ud for den jyske vestkyst s dan m vikingerne ogs have haft det for 1000 r siden det har v ret en rigtig forrygende sejlads selv om vi natten til s ndag m tte gennem nogle kraftige tordenbyger og m tte pumpe 200 liter vand ud af skibet p bare ti minutter
664349 vi har haft enkelte s syge men ingenting i forhold til vores h rdeste tur gennem det keltiske hav tidligere p togtet forklarede han
664350 jeg har besluttet mig for ikke at blive s syg l ngere og hvis du s rger for at v re udhvilet m t varm og t r s kan du holde s sygen v k men vi s i det keltiske hav at en kollektiv s syge kan genereres ved at bes tningsmedlemmerne smitter hinanden
664351 det har v ret en meget fin og hurtig sejlads i dag lige ved indsejlingen ved thybor n gik det s st rkt at vi sejlede en b je ned men vi undgik at g p grund og havnen tog vores lille fejl med overb renhed
664352 it has never been done before i doubt it will be repeated this is it weve got a golden opportunity to fast forward our research
664353 i immediately jumped off my seat i thought this is what ive been waiting for i said thank god for the olympics for me this is 10 times better than winning the lottery
664354 if mother nature cooperates i expect there would be an impact but it all depends on the wind directions
664355 its a giant science experiment on air pollution as far as i know its the biggest case where a city that had air quality problems took strong measures to improve air quality theyve taken it very seriously its exciting from a science standpoint
664356 they didnt have to go to quite the extremes that beijing has beijing has had to come a long way further than l a or atlanta
664357 its not just about china its about megacities across the world whats learned here can perhaps be applied to other cities
664358 hopefully with our data china can see the need to take a dramatic policy strategy to continue the good policies they conducted during the games
664359 i hope the sky can stay blue like this both during and after the olympic games
664360 this will give foreigners a good impression of the city and leave a legacy to beijing citizens
664361 its much better than i expected theres none of the gunk in the air
664362 there is a little haze in the air but that reminds me of los angeles in 1984 but its nothing like ive been reading about
664363 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
664364 a safe olympics is also a key indicator of the positive reflection of our nations image
664365 protest by athletes doesnt really mar the games because that is something even the ioc would be opposed to
664366 but i think major protests that the chinese put down in front of television cameras particularly if they are foreign protesters that could look very bad
664367 when you are the biggest country in the world and youre an illiberal regime and youre hosting the olympics then its bound to be political
664368 these multibillion dollar iconic olympic facilities are meant to show that china is not simply the great wall its modern its powerful its a player
664369 if i dont have written proof of something we have to take for granted the passports that weve seen and have been checked by the ioc are ok
664370 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes
664371 its not the task of the ioc to check every one of the 10 000 athletes
664372 its just as grave and just as brutal like cheating with doping
664373 the international gymnastics federation strictly verified their passports and confirmed that their ages met the age rules for participating in the world championship world cup and olympics
664374 a passport does nothing passports at this point in china is nothing they can do anything
664375 i dont believe you have to be a child psychologist or doctor to look at those particular girls and say wait a minute these are kids they are not 16 years old not a doubt in my mind
664376 you can test for lots of drugs but theres really no carbon dating
664377 other than believing what they say where is the truth if you have to look for some independent source i dont know
664378 we were looking for some new ideas and mr chen has certainly brought those to us
664379 he has taken us from a development level to the top level
664380 my family is really happy im here and they can watch me coach at the olympics
664381 i think they will cheer for both the americans and chinese no problem with that i have so many friends here so it feels like being at home
664382 this is a whole new olympics and we dont know what is going to happen
664383 i still have hope and i still think i have a medal chance if i put all my dives together at the right time i have a chance for gold that would be a great ending to end on a high note like that
664384 now i got my foot through the door and i aint goin nowhere it took awhile to get me in and im gonna take my time
664385 the lord will fight for you you need only to be still
664386 in this new version merlin and arthur are young contemporaries for the first time ever bringing a much loved tale to a whole new generation with a fresh youthful new look and approach for saturday nights this autumn on bbc one i am thrilled to announce john hurt has just been cast as the voice of the great dragon he is merlins mythological mentor and the only dragon left with magic powers it is an absolute privilege to be working with him as he brings real gravity to the series alongside a strong core cast and brilliant guests

664392 he was forceful articulate and had a loud booming voice
664393 we all have a cause we care about whether its finding a cure for cancer saving the environment finding homes for abandoned pets or so many other worthwhile endeavors but what we dont all have is the time or money to support these efforts as much as wed like so what if we could raise money for our favorite charities and schools by doing something we do every day searching the internet goodsearch is a search engine which donates 50 percent of its revenue to the charities and schools designated by its users its a simple and compelling concept you use goodsearch exactly as you would any other search engine because its powered by yahoo you get proven search results the money goodsearch donates to your cause comes from its advertisers the users and the organizations do not spend a dime
664394 no but you also tend to fall for someone you dont know and love them unconditionally
664395 hes working on a movie but hopefully we will be able to co ordinate our schedules so we can spend some time together
664396 the map you recovered in your previous assignment turned out not to lead to jones headquarters after all but to one of the research labs of his chief chemical engineer ludovic bremmer the lab is currently vacated we believe somewhere inside is a briefcase of ours that was stolen by one of bremmers men last week it contains information about our plans to stop jones find the briefcase
664397 if you dont fall for the joke you get to be in on it
664398 lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their computer 2 000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh
664399 you look for someone who is full of it a real blowhard then you exploit their insecurities to get an insane amount of drama laughs and lulz rules would be simple 1 do whatever it takes to get lulz 2 make sure the lulz is widely distributed this will allow for more lulz to be made 3 the game is never over until all the lulz have been had

664405 it was the top of the third and randy johnson led off the inning by flying out to manny in left to repeat randy johnson was the first batter of the inning and had made an out check out how many outs manny flashed to center fielder andruw jones after making the catch
664406 in future years we will likely see more young men blaze the same trail as jennings especially if jennings shows there is a viable path to professional basketball that does not include a pit stop in college and also provides an opportunity to earn money and get their families out of poor circumstances at an earlier date the ncaa should either respond to this fast changing world by letting go of its notion that u s born players should be compelled to attend college for a set amount of years or by enhancing the experience it provides these gifted players
664407 its always good if you can give the kids a bit of attention
664408 they are in a bad situation and hopefully if they are chelsea fans it might give them new motivation
664409 i really hope we do face semi pro inc this season
664410 they havent been challenged so far well provide that challenge when we face them this season
664411 i told you i was going to get anthony from young gunnaz last week

664513 u s economy grows at solid pace in 2nd quarter
664514 much of the improvement came from the one time bump from economic stimulus payments raising prospects of weaker performance in months ahead
664515 looking at it from the government point of view theres a strong political motivation to understate the cpi by understating it keeps cola adjustments down on entitlements which are at this point the largest part of the governments budget and by understating cpi the government can minimize the inflationary impact on things such as rents which are indexed to cpi or wages pensions and a whole list of ancillary costs to artificially keep inflation rates down bottom line the published cpi understates the real inflation rate
664516 while sometimes devastating these global relative price pressures are not the same thing as inflation
664517 the fed remains skeptical that high commodity prices will ripple through the economy leading to broad price hikes and big wage increases
664518 as consumers spend more money for higher priced petroleum and agricultural goods they eventually have less money to spend on other goods and services other relative prices must then fall
664519 fingered exploding inflation as the biggest risk to the economy
664520 products of public policies which deeply affect markets supply and demand consumers producers and speculators
664521 declining capitalist investment in the productive economy the vast increase of capital flowing in the paper economy the huge increases in profits and the grotesque salaries bonuses and payoffs to senior executives totally unrelated to performance
664522 in other words in the contemporary economy inflation benefits the wealthy because they pay their workers in deflated currency while they can take advantage of inflation to further jack up prices and then income thus the upper classes have fortified their economic positions to take account of inflation through their power over prices income and other compensations in a way that wage workers and people on fixed income and other vulnerable sectors cannot bankers protect their loans via adjustable interest rates monopoly resource owners jack up prices to retain profits wholesalers mark up prices to compensate for higher commodity prices large scale retailers squeeze final consumers the great majority at the bottom of the production and distribution chain
664523 in asia particularly pakistan india indonesia south korea philippines nepal mongolia and china hundreds of millions of workers peasants artisans and low paid self employed workers as well as housewives and pensioners have engaged in sustained mass protests as they experience a decline in the quality and quantity of food purchases as prices skyrocket in africa hunger stalks the land and major food riots have occurred from egypt through sub saharan africa to south africa in the caribbean central and south america food riots have led to the overthrow of regimes mass protests road blockages from argentina bolivia through colombia venezuela and haiti

664525 when i was serving a sentence on robben island during the struggle to end apartheid in south africa i never suspected that the end of white minority rule in my home country would be the beginning of yet another struggle for justice this time against the world bank and the international monetary fund
664526 as architects of the global economy the world bank and the imf have enormous power and shape the conditions of peoples lives around the world
664527 i live now in the united states where people so far are relatively unscathed by the reordering of the global economy for the benefit of the very rich
664528 the imf and world bank with the structural adjustment programs saps they impose on indebted countries and their pro corporate development projects are the leading edge of oppressive globalization the policies they have imposed in africa latin america and asia have condemned people to stagnation poverty and death for twenty years and those policies are now being adopted in the countries of europe and north america too
664529 although some of them may have tricked themselves into believing that the neo liberal economic model they defend is immutable like a law of nature most of them probably know that they are perpetrating a fraud of global proportions michael camdessus who retired after thirteen years as managing director of the imf told a group of u s religious leaders that he was willing to sacrifice a generation in order to realize the so called benefits of the macroeconomic model
664530 given the reluctance of india and other developing nations to sacrifice food security measures in the wake of the recent global spike in food prices
664531 the tariff cuts demanded of developing countries would have caused massive job loss and countries would have lost the ability to protect farmers from dumping further impoverishing millions on the verge of survival
664532 we see many of the essential ingredients for a classic asset bubble said edward morse chief energy economist at lehman brothers morse estimated that 90 billion has flowed into the biggest commodity indices in just more than two years and more money has flowed into other exchanges pushing up prices
664533 the cftcs economists are saying that supply and demand seem to be driving this but we have clients in the business that have experienced these markets for many many years and what im hearing from them is that they dont see any change in the fundamentals of supply and demand
664534 is it a matter of institutional investors seeking shelter from the subprime crisis and the credit crunch
664535 i dont know but i do know that speculators as a class do not agree on anything and yet there is almost unanimity of opinion these days and the money to make the opinions matter the fact that prices have been relentlessly trending up suggests a new type of market participant with a mentality that is traditionally more in line with investing in securities than trading in commodities if enough of these wealthy people or funds or other entities with a lot of capital decide to flip out of securities for a little while and go into commodities and theyre all looking for something that is going up and you get enough billions of dollars thinking that way then their wish comes true
664536 the situation now is that the cftc is sitting there looking at one screen one piece of the picture which is whatever is happening on the exchanges meanwhile an increasing volume in dollars is taking place in the form of over the counter activity where no one can see it there is still a blind spot with respect to the true over the counter activity that is going on which represents billions and billions of dollars

664559 the years i have been involved in the camps and the athletes have had an extended stay are the years when the athletes have done worse they have performed below my expectations the years they have done very well are when we have done our own training and arrived at the meeting two or three days before
664560 bolt ensured that that happened since may asafa has been almost reformed it has done wonders for his performance his concern for things that he is supposed to be concerned about
664561 then now and for the future i think we will see what he is really capable of because so far i dont think we have seen it
664562 i think that asafa has not gone into one of these meets in this kind of shape he technically is making very few mistakes right now

664589 we asked mayor jones for permission before we began and we selected him simply because he is mayor

664592 its really vital to ensure youre working to improve regulatory delays planning delays
664593 theres a lot of areas not only in capital cities but in regional areas that have slipped quite a bit
664594 the key to it is getting the planning scheme right and if that is right you dont need to rely on lots of planning provisions when it comes time to getting a planning permit
664595 there are obviously statutory time frames in which to issue planning permits however our targets are set to improve on those statutory time frames
664596 this is a symptom of what has to be fixed

664634 i think some employers are insensitive i dont think they have any understanding of pregnant employees they need guidelines
664635 small businesses have trouble just trying to cope with someone being off on maternity leave hiring someone who is pregnant brings additional complications for them
664636 they look for who can do the job now if the person is leaving on maternity leave in a couple of months and somebody else is there rather than starting all over again they might say this new person has some advantages
664637 this leaves the company with no alternative but to dismiss you

664644 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage

664651 actually im kind of surprised if this is dr libshitzs name your name is your identity hes had this his entire life i think he needs a little bit of personal attention
664652 as a general rule since 2005 verizon doesnt allow questionable language in e mail addresses but we can and do make exceptions based on reasonable requests the one from dr and mrs libshitz certainly is reasonable and we regret the inconvenience and frustration theyve been caused
664653 these people have no trouble putting me in their phone book they send me mail with that name they send me a bill routinely and they cash my checks with libshitz on it they just offended me
664654 but ill never forgive myself if we dont go all the way tonight

664663 these are tough economic times for people of all ages but few are affected more than senior citizens living on pensions and social security
664664 whats the average 401k balance like 60 grand thatll last a year or two at best i have a bad feeling there are a lot of boomers out there that will be hurting a lot of people say that it just means people will keep working but where and no it will not be their houses that save them
664665 problem is the boomers expected it to go on and on forever and theyve done their damnest to try and keep it all propped up and havent planned for any future
664666 this is exactly it most people once they make money think it will go on for ever my landlord made a couple hundred k on his prior rental property so he sold it at the peak and bought a bigger one now he looses 1800 a month when the place is fully rented he says he is a year or two from bankruptcy were moving to a new place this weekend he hasnt rented our unit yet ouch
664667 those stats on seniors filing for bk are nothing short of alarming
664668 how the reic thought it would become typical for seniors to play with houses is another sign of the retirement fetish for all the hype about seniors in az and fl there are many many more like my parents and their neighbors who are only leaving their homes for many their first and only one feet first
664669 was talking to a couple of neighbors the other eve all of us fall into that much ballyhooed boomer age group one neighbor noted that she has around 250k in her retirement account the house is also paid off
664670 and guess what she and her partner arent about to buy if you guessed another house youre right they have no intentions of living for their house payment during their senior years
664671 i consider a paid for house a source of imputed tax free cash flow the amount of rent one would otherwise pay to someone else is instead paid to himself tax free if one were to purchase a tax free bond and use its interest to pay his rent how much would the bond cost
664672 whatever the cost this could be considered the value of his house as measured by the imputed rent the house generates after all expenses
664673 what youre saying here brings up a question i often struggle with pay off the house or keep the cash so far ive been going with keep the cash my thinking being that when cash is king if ive paid off my house i wont be able to get easy access to the cash when there are great land business stock opportunities on the other hand i hate having the mortgage payment
664674 i contend that most of this holding demographic already retired i can only speak for vt and ny but depending on department you can draw on your pension as early as 50 years old and this warped notion gave birth to all the moronic expressions we love to castigate like the boomers are coming rich retirees want to live here blah blah blah
664675 the boomers retiring should do nothing but produce churn in the market
664676 sell your 3000 sq ft home in nj buy a 1500 sq ft home in fl still the same number of homes out there and still one for sale most boomers arent buying a 2nd home at 60 years old they either already own it or will sell their primary residence to buy their retirement home
664677 and frankly most of the boomers arent going anywhere however if the sell then buy does become real it could put extreme pressure on house prices in the areas the boomers are leaving ny comes to mind
664678 my parents were between the boomers and greatest generation they owned thier own primary residences and were re investors over their lifetimes as they grew older they sold their investment properties so they could have less work rentals are a lot of work and more cash on hand
664679 much easier to invest in fixed income bonds cds than to manage rentals especially when you are older this notion that boomers are going to save any market is a sham stocks housing bonds etc will all be sold off as they age this was meant to be what they lived off in retirement they will not be investing new money after they retire imho

664688 wealthy spaniards bought golf shares as an investment in the past decade when they had credit on tap says javier olmos a co owner of madrid based 18golfclub which brokers membership sales that created a price bubble similar to the one in the housing market where prices surged even when renting was cheaper
664689 members also pay monthly greens fees of as much as 300 euros olmos says spains golf industry has surged in line with the housing boom investors bankrolled more than 100 new courses in the past 10 years turning the sport into a 2 4 billion annual business many spaniards started playing after buying vacation homes adjoining courses olmos says

664699 weve always felt that real estate is the most solid investment even with the ups and downs said nancy svelmoe 58
664700 she said the couple is confident that las vegas real estate will recover we feel people moving from california where there is no place to grow and the snowbirds will be part of the upturn in las vegas she said

664710 whats so fantastic is that we found them completely furnished with beds chairs tables communication systems and the personal effects of the soldiers who lived inside
664711 emptied by the danes of their contents after world war ii to salvage the scrap iron and electrical devices that were needed
664712 it was like entering the heart of a pyramid with mummies all around i dug a tunnel through the sand that was blocking the entrance to the bunkers and what i saw blew me away it was as if the german soldiers had left only yesterday
664713 it was a race against the clock because of the risk of looters we lied to keep them at bay saying that there was only one furnished bunker and that it was guarded around the clock which wasnt true but even so there were two attempted break ins
664714 it was surprising to see the soldiers living conditions in the bunkers
664715 in a way this discovery can be compared to tutankhamuns tomb almost a century ago it has to be preserved and to blow up the bunkers as some have suggested would be like denying that world war ii ever existed
664716 disgusted that people want to attract tourists to this kind of garbage
664717 was not from the bronze age what has been found is incredibly authentic and tells us a lot about how they lived in these bunkers
664718 we dont expect contemporary objects like these to be so well preserved maybe its because they were kept for 60 years in the cold and dark like in a big vacuum
664719 world war ii and its memories will not just go away and discoveries like these breathe new life into the story and the fascination that still surrounds this war

664737 the present ownership of lots on the island is in limbo we must have order
664738 there is no order now on land ownership in boracay wetlands are being covered and no build zones are being used we do not want the remaining trees to disappear
664739 if the bill becomes a law it will be economically beneficial to us because lands will be now titled and its market value will surely rise
664740 we must look at it with the greater good in mind

664743 engkau selalu menyebutku di majalahmu ahlu hadits ini sebagai orang terlaknat pendusta pembohong perusak maka aku banyak tersakiti olehmu maka aku berdoa jika aku memang pendusta dan pembohong sebagaimana engkau sebutkan tentang aku di majalahmu maka aku akan binasa di masa hidupmu karena aku tahu bahwa umur pendusta dan perusak itu tidak akan panjang tapi bila aku bukan pendusta dan pembohong bahkan aku mendapat kemuliaan dalam bentuk bercakap dengan allah serta aku adalah al masih yang dijanjikan maka aku berdoa agar kamu tidak selamat dari akibat orang orang pendusta sesuai dengan sunnatullah aku umumkan bahwa jika engkau tidak mati semasa aku hidup dengan hukuman allah yang tidak terjadi kecuali benar benar dari allah seperti mati dengan sakit thaun atau kolera berarti aku bukan rasul dari allah aku berdoa kepada allah wahai penolongku yang maha melihat yang maha kuasa yang maha berilmu yang mengetahui rahasia qalbu bila aku ini adalah pendusta dan perusak dalam pandangan mu dan aku berdusta atas diri mu malam dan siang hari ya allah maka matikan aku di masa hidup ustadz tsana ullah bahagiakan jamaahnya dengan kematianku amin wahai allah jika aku benar dan tsana ullah di atas kesalahan serta berdusta dalam tuduhannya terhadapku maka matikan dia di masa hidupku dengan penyakit penyakit yang membinasakan seperti thaun dan kolera atau penyakit penyakit selainnya akhirnya aku berharap dari ustadz tsana ullah untuk menyebarkan pernyataan ini di majalahnya kemudian berilah catatan kaki sekehendaknya keputusannya sekarang di tangan allah penulis hamba allah ash shamad ghulam ahmad al masih semoga allah memberinya afiat dan bantuan tabligh risalat juz 10 hal 120 apa yang terjadi setelah berlalu 13 bulan 10 hari dari waktu itu justru ghulam ahmad yang diserang ajal doanya menimpa dirinya sendiri putranya basyir ahmad menceritakan ibuku mengabarkan kepadaku bahwa hadrat ghulam ahmad butuh ke wc langsung setelah makan lalu tidur sejenak setelah itu butuh ke wc lagi maka dia pergi ke sana 2 atau 3 kali tanpa memberitahu aku kemudian dia bangunkan aku maka aku melihatnya lemah sekali dan tidak mampu untuk pergi ke ranjangnya oleh karenanya dia duduk di tempat tidurku mulailah aku mengusapnya dan memijatnya tak lama kemudian ia butuh ke wc lagi tetapi sekarang ia tidak dapat pergi ke wc karena itu dia buang hajat di sisi tempat tidur dan ia berbaring sejenak setelah buang hajat kelemahan sudah mencapai puncaknya tapi masih saja hendak buang air besar diapun buang hajatnya lalu dia muntah setelah muntah dia terlentang di atas punggungnya dan kepalanya menimpa kayu dipan maka berubahlah keadaannya
664744 malam ketika sakitnya hadhrat ghulam ahmad aku tidur di kamarku ketika sakitnya semakin parah mereka membangunkan aku dan aku melihat rasa sakit yang dia derita dia katakan kepadaku aku terkena kolera kemudian tidak bicara lagi setelah itu dengan kata yang jelas sampai mati pada hari berikutnya setelah jam 10 pagi
664745 orang kuat itu bukanlah yang menang dalam gulat tetapi orang kuat adalah yang mampu menahan nafsu amarahnya
664746 siapa yang dikatakan paling kuat diantara kalian shahabat menjawab yaitu diantara kami yang paling kuat gulatnya beliau bersabda bukan begitu tetapi dia adalah yang paling kuat mengendalikan nafsunya ketika marah
664747 barangsiapa yang mampu menahan marahnya padahal dia mampu menyalurkannya maka allah menyeru pada hari kiamat dari atas khalayak makhluk sampai disuruh memilih bidadari mana yang mereka mau
664748 tidaklah hamba meneguk tegukan yang lebih utama di sisi allah subhanahu wa taala dari meneguk kemarahan karena mengharap wajah allah subhanahu wa taala
664749 tidaklah seorang hamba menahan kemarahan karena allah subhanahu wa taala kecuali allah subhanahu wa taala akan memenuhi baginya keamanan dan keimanan
664750 dari abu hurairah radliyallahu anhu bahwa seseorang berkata kepada nabi shalallahu alaihi wasallam berwasiatlah kepadaku beliau bersabda jangan menjadi seorang pemarah kemudian diulang ulang beberapa kali dan beliau bersabda janganlah menjadi orang pemarah
664751 aku berkata ya rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wasallam berwasiatlah kepadaku beliau bersabda jangan menjadi pemarah maka berkata seseorang maka aku pikirkan apa yang beliau sabdakan ternyata pada sifat pemarah itu terkumpul seluruh kejelekan
664752 ada dua orang saling mencela di sisi nabi shalallahu alaihi wasallam dan kami sedang duduk di samping nabi shalallahu alaihi wasallam salah satu dari keduanya mencela lawannya dengan penuh kemarahan sampai memerah wajahnya maka nabi shalallahu alaihi wasallam bersabda sesungguhnya aku akan ajarkan suatu kalimat yang kalau diucapkan akan hilang apa yang ada padanya yaitu sekiranya dia mengucapkan audzubillahi minasy syaithani rrajiim maka mereka berkata kepada yang marah tadi tidakkah kalian dengar apa yang disabdakan nabi dia menjawab aku ini bukan orang gila
664753 apabila salah seorang diantara kalian marah dalam keadaan berdiri duduklah jika belum hilang maka berbaringlah
664754 sesungguhnya marah itu dari syaithan dan syaithan itu dicipta dari api dan api itu diredam dengan air maka apabila diantara kalian marah berwudlulah
664755 empat hal barangsiapa yang mampu mengedalikannya maka allah akan menjaga dari syetan dan diharomkan dari neraka yaitu seseorang mampu menguasai nafsunya ketika berkeinginan cemas syahwat dan marah
664756 sesungguhnya orang yang paling keras siksaannya pada hari kiamat adalah orang membuat gambar seperti gambar ini
664757 anas membantu rumah tangga rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wasallam selama 10 tahun maka tidak pernah beliau berkata kepada anas
664758 ya allah aku memohon kepada mu berbicara yang benar ketika marah dan ridha
664759 tiga hal termasuk akhlak keimanan yaitu orang yang jika marah kemarahannya tidak memasukkan ke dalam perkara batil jika senang maka kesenangannya tidak mengeluarkan dari kebenaran dan jika dia mampu dia tidak melakukan yang tidak semestinya
664760 bukanlah puasa itu sekedar menahan makan dan minum sesungguhnya puasa itu adalah puasa dari perbuatan keji dan sia sia apabila ada orang yang mencelamu atau membodohimu maka katakanlah sesungguhnya aku sedang berpuasa sesungguhnya aku sedang berpuasa

664763 after that we will start working on a long term financing
664764 its dead in the water because the concert was a success there was hope of a tour but that was a lot of speculation it would be great if they would but as far as we know that is dead in the water
664765 you go in and take a hot shower and retire to bed and you start what i call zoning down coming back to real life
664766 then you start talking to yourself you did it this was your dream when you were at mcclymonds
664767 its the best feeling in the world when youre the fastest man in the world its like walking around on clouds
664768 my ex wife doesnt know this nobody knows it but i stood there for 10 or 15 minutes crying i had to let it out
664769 they told my wife dont sleep in the bed with your husband they gave instructions to a married woman on how not to sleep with her husband
664770 i slept in the bed and we did what husbands and wives do
664771 i felt fine the next morning because i got such a good rest the other guys were tossing and turning i was in a comfortable place that i was accustomed to very relaxed and i just went out there and ran
664772 i dont even think i did the big picture until 10 years later
664773 im ready for bed im laying down but i was back in that first pitch
664774 it was the first time i sort of enjoyed it at all i remember the feeling and everything clicked
664775 everything you worked for the last 20 years sort of came out in that first pitch i dont know if they clocked that but i know it was freaking fast and it was going to go right down the middle
664776 its just weird its a team sport but when youre in that pitchers circle sometimes you feel really alone
664777 cmon you and me now they televise everything its a good thing they didnt do it then because you would have seen me talking the whole time
664778 i understand why he did it she said of u
664779 but even after the game i was still thinking about how that next pitch would have been better than the last one i threw
664780 i suppose that doesnt let you enjoy it as a whole but the older i get i look back on it more fondly than i did right after the game
664781 i was one of the few to make it through the boycott you have to answer so many questions am i going to win my times made me a favorite but until you step on the blocks you just dont know
664782 the 200 butterfly was a tough race to have hanging over my head because it was so much of a chore for me it was back to business
664783 when youre in the middle of it you almost cant know how special it is
664784 twenty four years later i can definitely step back its different now you definitely realize how special it is and how lucky you are
664785 we were in l a and we had a big party at the hotel afterward
664786 you can imagine as a college junior there were not really any boundaries
664787 sean was 2 months old and we put the gold medal around his neck and took pictures of him
664788 but they were both dreams to be able to share with family and friends there was satisfaction and relief too you feel some pressure representing more than yourself youre playing for the united states
664789 i probably could have gotten home from barcelona without the plane
664790 i remember reminiscing on the flight with assistant coach p j carlesimo how we were going to go down in history
664791 one thing that was for sure you can only do something for the first time once
664792 that medal is a symbol of a lot of things
664793 ill always remember 1996 as the olympics that women took over we showed the world that women are strong competitive and beautiful that was the beginning we went down in history that group was amazing
664794 i just remember thinking what this is crazy at one point i looked up and thought i could see stars twinkling in the sky but it was the lights from all of the cameras
664795 there was this sense of freedom release and joy we were so elated
664796 there was a greater purpose to show the world a level of womens basketball theyd never seen the olympics was a launchpad for womens basketball in the united states we showed people what we already knew for years
664797 whenever you can do something that has a lasting impact
664798 to me an athlete who has an individual sport and theyre on the stand by themselves i can see its a lot more emotional than it is for a team
664799 its very exciting but with an individual you see the tears coming down their face i dont remember anything special we did it doesnt stand out like other things like winning the ncaa title at cal
664800 it was kind of a blur at some point all the guys got to me
664801 the focus was really on me because of what had happened to me they obviously wanted it for themselves but they wanted it for me that was a good feeling i wanted them to know in every way that i appreciated that because i really did i was very happy that they felt that way about me
664802 obviously that wasnt my prime objective not having that 100 detracted a bit but only in the sense that i didnt get to run it

664812 first there was skkull then there was the drone drug continuing on the same path the sound of the drone drug is of a similar relentless minimalistic nature as its predesessor this could be seen as the electronic backbone to last years amazing blood spirits amp drums are singing conspiracy records creating a heavy beast with the most basic and stripped down use of variations in drones and frequencies instead of guitars and percussion monotonous motor humming via drugged out machinery and assaults of feedback attacking with a strong feel of claustrophobia compared to skkull the drone drug evolves more around a grim and abrasive sound constantly toying with lo fi aesthetics and a rough industrial edge the atmosphere created is thick and black bringing up visions of a dystopian society trembling on the edge of the world spreading the disease in a world slowly dying the drone drug is poison and affect you it will on this recording the skull defekts is joachim nordwall and henrik rylander 4 tracks cut by an unsharpened razor total playtime of 52 minutes 4 panel digipack with artwork by daniel fagerstr m

664818 the fourth album by the sample sculptor of finlands oulu features only one long piece of sound slowly and ponderously developing sound mass moves between minimalist ambient and melodic sequences both beautiful and mentally jarring it is both organic and spacy almost at the same time

664835 transmitting from france the soulighters guitars woodwinds keys and percussion offer a stumbling drunken clatter and drone that settles itself upon the listener like a blanket of warm confusion and guides the ear deep into a thick forest of drawn out pulses and reverberations ultimately manifesting itself in a ritualistic ambience with serpentine flashing and circular hum like church music if god were not only real but serious about his head
664836 austin texas produces yet another glorious batch of sublime freaks growing a glooping pulsating garden of acid fried driftetables and deconstructed space blooms vast open vistas of echoed out cosmic tones all given depth and dimension by the wandering lonely wails of human women folk blending all within a dream teetering on the edge of nightmare

664983 our intent is to raise 150 000 pounds of fresh produce on the farm annually and make it available first and foremost locally in the mad river valley and washington county and then also to other food shelves and pantries around the state
664984 its a way for us to sustain a sustainable source of fresh produce for the people we serve often times its the fresh produce that doesnt make its way into the shopping cart of needy vermonters because its unaffordable so they lose access and they lose the nutrient value of produce in their diet
664985 people took notice when the for sale sign went up
664986 they didnt want it developed if it was up a back road or the community wasnt as into it we might not have stepped in but the sense of opportunity became more about what it could be than about preventing development
664987 this farm is right on route 100 its got great access for people to see and drive past and its a gateway to the mad river valley
664988 my feeling has always been that were not taking business from local farmers because the pie is getting bigger as people realize the importance of eating locally
664989 its increasingly unaffordable for us to take fresh produce from outside the state so we need to gather as much locally as we can the short term gain is significant and the long term gain is well continue to have the fresh produce and the educational opportunities to better understand the issue of hunger
664990 youre saving on gas youre cutting out the middle man youre producing it as cheaply as possible and itll give you the food you want its a win win win situation

664998 there is a shift in the market the market has moved from being concerned with inflation pressures to realizing that perhaps growth is slowing enough across the board to eventually contain inflation pressures so they have started to reprice risks
664999 in areas like the u s it does help the central bank
665000 both debt and equity investors as well as policy makers should cheer
665001 further decline in commodities will be equity market friendly to the extent that headline inflation also recedes subsequent fed eases should steepen the u s yield courtesy of a front end rally
665002 this suggests that even with the ecbs higher weight on inflation since the july rate hike a near term rate hike is unlikely
665003 however we expect that with inflation rates around 2 percent in mid 2009 and ongoing weak economic growth the ecb will cut rates eventually
665004 it makes it relatively easier for central banks but it doesnt mean they dont have to hike interest rates especially in places like india or brazil

665024 we werent quick enough we didnt do a good enough job in qualifying yesterday which hurt us in the race we struggled to find pace and it was hard to stay with the toyotas and renaults who were fighting in the championship lets hope its this track though and that we can bounce back in valencia
665025 unfortunately i got some traffic before my last stop which allowed nick heidfeld to pass me otherwise i couldnt do anymore today the car has a lot of oversteer and rear sliding now well just focus on the next race and see that we can do there
665026 obviously it was a very difficult race for us we converted my strategy to a one stopper which was the right thing to do so thanks to the team for that after that though i was running heavy and struggling on the option tyres so had to fight for pace i then made contact with fisichella and lost a position fortunately i was able to regain it when he had to make his final stop that was all we could do today so we need to look into what happened and try to improve for the next race
665027 my first lap wasnt great i was in the wrong place and lost a few positions then during my first pit stop something went wrong with the fuel rig which cost me a couple of decisive seconds and put me behind fisichella my strategy was over then in terms of the heat i didnt have a problem with it weve definitely had worse races this year
665028 i believe we have could have done a bit better but i got stuck behind alonso my car was good and around the end of the race i was able to catch glock but i had to back off in the end
665029 i believe we have the speed in our car but if we cant get a better result in qualifying we will run into the same problems again we really need to sort this out if we are in front we can fight for wins but the third place here in hungary is a good result after a difficult weekend for me
665030 this is a great moment it feels fantastic really this is a moment i have been targeting for many years now and to achieve this goal is pleasing i hope this is the first of many
665031 of course im very happy with this win we have been in a position to fight for race wins this season but there was always something going wrong today lewis hamilton and massa were fastest in the r ace but i tried to push massa hoping he would have a mechanical failure and it seemed to have worked
665032 this is just unbelievable i couldnt believe it when i saw massas engine blow and i was racing in second position i was under pressure from raikkonen and i was struggling quite a lot but i had a really good car it was perfect until the last stint unbelievable in my first year in formula 1

665036 i am really proud of the way we played in this test match
665037 the first test was one of those games where nothing went right for us but the way we have come back after four days its really amazing
665038 i am really proud of the fact that i have this group of players who have shown so much resilience not just once but time and time again
665039 the way viru sehwag got those runs scoring 201 out of 329 is something that is really amazing

665050 resorting to violence to express displeasure over a verdict is something that is completely unacceptable and is counterproductive
665051 this tragedy has deeply saddened new yorkers and all americans my thoughts are with nicole and her children and the rest of seans family during this difficult time the court has given its verdict and now we await the conclusion of a department of justice civil rights investigation we must also embrace this opportunity to take steps in our communities in our law enforcement agencies and in our government to make sure this does not happen again

665068 new zealands law does not go as far as the dmca in the us but it is unjust nonetheless
665069 drm is nearly always the result of a conspiracy of companies to restrict the technology available to the public such conspiracy should be a crime and the executives responsible for it should be sentenced to prison
665070 free software means that people are free to cooperate and control their own computing
665071 you dont find malicious features in free software because the users are in control
665072 non free proprietary software keeps the users divided and helpless divided because each user is forbidden to share it and helpless because the users dont have the source code so they cant even tell what its doing to them
665073 to use proprietary software is to invite the developer to put his boot on your neck its power that nobody should have
665074 i dont have any other specific plans but id be happy to talk with any other free software developers about useful kinds of cooperation
665075 is based on ethical values of freedom and social solidarity
665076 we reject non free software regardless of what practical advantages or disadvantages it may have because one uses it at the price of ones freedom
665077 many geeks who prefer not to think about ethical issues chose the gnu linux system for its practical advantages and some of them also contributed to its development
665078 however they coined the term open source in 1998 in order to talk about the same corpus of free software more or less but without alluding to ethical issues and values
665079 i respect their right to their views but people with their views would never have sought to produce a completely free operating system the reason we have one is because of people who do care about freedom
665080 each software patent is a government imposed monopoly on implementing some computational idea or technique any software developer or computer user that implements the technique can get sued for it thus you as a developer or user can be sued by parties unknown to you over the ideas in the code that you wrote or the system that you set up
665081 the best solution to this problem is not to allow software patents however in countries that do all developers and distributors are likely to be threatened as red hat was by firestar and datatern a dispute settled last month
665082 that is why gpl version 3 requires companies that redistribute to get licences that cover all their downstream users
665083 the megacorporations cross license with each other and can force anyone else except a patent troll to cross license with them too thus they avoid most of the harm and patents give them a sort of control over their field
665084 the us government generally works for the megacorporations so it tries to bully other countries into allowing software patents governments that are inclined to bow down to the megacorporations give in but they shouldnt

665170 within hardly 18 years nearly 2 billion people will inhabit countries and regions where water might seem a far away memory
665171 according to the world water council wwc the number of persons affected by this serious situation will increase to 3 5 billion by the year 2015
665172 many regions in this planet suffer from severe water shortage where the annual rate of cubic meters per person is less than 500 every time there are more and more regions suffering from a chronic shortage of this vital resource
665173 an insufficient amount of the precious fluid necessary to produce foodstuffs the impaired development of industry urban areas and tourism and the emergence of health problems are some of the consequences that derive from water shortage

665180 the deal itself is not expected to close until the end of the year as a result its premature to talk about specific integration plans
665181 while all agencies have initiated efforts to deploy encryption technologies none had documented comprehensive plans to guide encryption implementation activities
665182 as a result federal information may remain at increased risk of unauthorized disclosure loss and modification
665183 when are we going to get serious about protecting data role based and policy based encryption not just device encryption
665184 until were serious about taking a strategic view of data were not going to have a big impact
665185 very well intentioned mandates to secure data and yet the way theyve gone about it is kind of a fallacy
665186 the idea that you can send out a circular from omb and suddenly everything magically gets fixed is a completely wrong expectation
665187 unfortunately im not surprised that despite mandates by omb the federal government is only 30 of the way there making the right investments in cybersecurity today will keep us from paying dearly in the long run
665188 in the past attrition org was approached by quite a few entities in the public and private sectors for input into their studies
665189 the information itself will hopefully become more complete and accurate with community contributions which should lend to more analysis about how and why data breaches occur and possibly and hopefully how they can be prevented in the future

665191 all submissions will be moderated by a core team of volunteers for accuracy

665195 cuando arsa pasa a manos de air comet el contrato estipulaba que la sepi le aportar a mediante interinvest 300 millones de d lares para el pago del pasivo que figuraba en el concurso de la aerol nea a ese dinero se le dio otro fin y hay pruebas de ello en la causa
665196 certific que del monto entregado por la sepi u s 273 millones fueron usados por air comet no para pagar la deuda como fijaba el contrato sino para subrogarse en la posici n de acreedor acceder al concurso y dominarlo
665197 es decir en vez de sanear el pasivo air comet se transform en acreedor de una deuda que deber a haber pagado con fondos p blicos
665198 ese dinero qued en arsa a cuenta de futuras ampliaciones de capital y parte de las acciones compradas con esa plata son las que ahora pasar an al estado argentino

665202 no tendr a que poner un peso por aerol neas porque esas acciones que est vendiendo las ha comprado con fondos que ten an otro destino y porque la deuda de 900 millones de d lares que hoy tendr a arsa es posconcursal

665207 we view this test as anything but successful these filters will wrongly block access to about 3 of the internet if they are forced on australians and while the minister may regard this as an acceptable level of collateral damage we do not
665208 the government needs to provide more information on what they want to block access to because it ranges from child porn to
665209 the upcoming trials are targeting a lot more than child pornography and illegal content
665210 the filters couldnt even block 100 of content that they are designated to block by the manufacturers
665211 with the 1 to 8 false positive rate australians are going to come up against quite a few blocked sites each day that should not be blocked i dont think they will tolerate it
665212 the internet contains hundreds of thousands of websites not appropriate for children by our classification standards and we cant block them all
665213 monitoring your childrens activity and using a local content filter is far better than relying on some bureaucratic blacklist
665214 i have no doubt absolutely no doubt that this will come straight out of the pockets of consumers and will sink small isps

665216 there often is a single networking guru who really does have the keys to everything you have to work very hard to make sure that more people have the keys
665217 unfortunately it is not that uncommon to come into a situation where one or two people have created a situation where not only are they the only ones that know what is going on but they are the only ones that can do anything
665218 requests for access passwords and documentation are frequently taken as hostile acts by those that have been holding the keys to the kingdom
665219 in my experience i have encountered this type of situation on more then one occasion
665220 realised that the pressure to follow processes and procedures was not going to go away despite the protesting
665221 for many organisations security is not a mission critical priority until it has been breached
665222 if you have one person serve as an administrator then have another person audit the administrator and have yet another person audit the auditor you get into a costly and time consuming cycle of inefficiency
665223 there should never be one person who is the only person who knows the configuration or the password

665230 in the future we expect more and more people to use online banking to make payments rather than just checking balances particularly in light of the recent introduction of the new faster payments service
665231 this enables customers to make one off payments over the internet or by phone within hours not days
665232 however we strongly urge banking customers to make sure they remain wary of online scams such as unsolicited emails claiming to be from their bank and to only use a fully protected pc with regularly updated anti virus software and a firewall installed and switched on
665233 yes size matters you want to have a comprehensive collection of documents from across the web but having a lot of documents doesnt mean you are most relevant
665234 with the huge caveat that nine queries are far from letting anyone conclude anything i still didnt come away with a sense that cuil has google beating relevancy instead it has some flaws though is better than many start up search engines appear out of the box
665235 i played with the site a fair bit when it turned on this morning so far it doesnt do much for me
665236 cuils new search engine cheaper than google but not better
665237 if your mission is to beat google in the search market its probably wise to give your upstart search engine a name that people know how to pronounce its also wise to make sure that it appears in the first page of search results for its own name cuil the upstart search engine that debuted today with aspirations of unseating google has apparently done neither
665238 cuil has an uphill battle in getting more consumers to search its site instead of google google wins hands down for brand recognition among us consumers

665261 ahora nos conocemos mejor sabemos la fuerza de los adversarios y la mezquindad de sus reivindicaciones pero tambi n sabemos que somos muchos los que entendemos la pol tica como herramienta de lucha a favor de los m s pobres y que esos muchos estamos representados por un gobierno que con aciertos y errores est dispuesto a realizar una pelea cotidiana a favor de una sociedad m s justa e igualitaria
665262 un polo de referencia para todo el peronismo que se siente herido que ha quedado afuera
665263 si no hay una definici n bien clara de qu pa s y qu estilo pol tico quiere tener ese sector lo nico que va a ser es un sector que de manera oportunista quiera aprovechar la debilidad del kirchnerismo
665264 we would be very interested in assets that arent core to wachovias business
665265 i think youll see a lot of that over the next six to 12 months
665266 i cant imagine that markets like philadelphia would ever be considered noncore by wachovia
665267 they should sell their new york city locations where they have been a total failure
665268 i think from new york south theyre pretty well entrenched
665269 those deposit franchises have a lot of value but my guess is when wachovia talks about the northeast they mean new york and new england from philadelphia they have such a good earnings stream they dont want to cut that off

665290 i saw a lot of what they were doing and saw all the good news they were getting out to the american people
665291 a darkly satirical look at a world of compulsory id cards in britain
665292 this is how we came to grief our protesters were unreasonably arrested merely for entering the carlton hotel in fancy dress costumes the protest was entirely peaceful but clearly id cards have become such a hot potato that campaigners are having to watch every move they make
665293 we were not allowed to attend this so called public consultation on id cards and this is why we were protesting if such matters have now become too controversial for open discourse perhaps it would be prudent for another paradise to learn the lessons
665294 this is probably my favorite activity to do when were here on tour when you get a chance to come out to the hospitals and see the kids and maybe talk to them about tennis which they might not know anything about sometimes i feel like they enjoy learning about it and its fun
665295 this is a tournament thats famous for giving back to their community and the hospitals just one of the entities that they help out to be able to come out here as a representative of the tournament its a good experience for me
665296 this case is not formally linked to the murder but the timing is suspicious
665297 why is it that four days after the murder of his wife they rush forward with these charges the government has rushed forward to go after him when hes vulnerable because of this tragedy
665298 i say luck is when an opportunity comes along and youre prepared for it

665314 documentaries of this nature play an important role in informing the public openly and transparently about the work of the police and uk border agency
665315 the home office do not influence the content of these programmes after they are commissioned and they adhere to ofcoms strict guidelines on this kind of programme
665316 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign

665323 we have compared di caprios photos with those of the younger lenin and the similarity is striking he could play the role without make up

665325 it is common knowledge that di caprio has slavic roots his ancestors on his mothers side emigrated from russia to germany

665329 about 300 tibetan protestors were detained after they tried to breach the police lines
665330 the state administration can confirm that police teams have counted 133 bodies at various hospitals after the tragedy
665331 the death toll could go up as a few more wounded could have succumbed to injuries on the way to local hospitals
665332 the rumours created a commotion that sparked the stampede as devotees on the stairway to the temple tried to push their way causing a collapse of the system of fences
665333 this panic caused a rush between crowds returning from the temple and those going up to the shrine
665334 devotees returning from the temple ran into pilgrims coming up then people tried to outpace each other to find an escape and tried to jump over the fences
665335 coming under immense human pressure the fences gave way and people fell down the slope several women and children who could not jump the railings and remained on the path were trampled upon
665336 i tried to put pressure on massa hoping something would happen
665337 its a great moment and it is a moment i have been targeting for many years
665338 we cant fight them because they are not fighting according to the articles of war they are just popping up out of nowhere and are killing our men

665340 pride goes before destruction and a haughty spiritbefore a fall
665341 i have come that you may have life and have it more abundantly
665342 for we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses but one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin
665343 i have made a covenant with my eyes not to gaze lustfully at a virgin
665344 if my step has turned from the way or my heart followed my eyes if my heart has been enticed by a woman or i have lurked at my neighbors doorway
665345 no temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man and god is faithful who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also so that you will be able to endure it
665346 youre a person of faith good for you how nice and inoffensive i can learn that you have some sort of supernatural beliefs and i can go on about my day without feeling in any way challenged or disturbed i can continue to respect you as an acquaintance because i dont know any specifics about your completely irrational beliefs such as that i am going to hell because i dont believe somebody died on a cross 2 000 years ago and came back to life
665347 is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all
665348 have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female and said for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh
665349 so they are no longer two but one flesh what therefore god has joined together let no man separate
665350 why then did moses command to give her a certificate of divorce and send her away
665351 because of your hardness of heart moses permitted you to divorce your wives but from the beginning it has not been this way and i say to you whoever divorces his wife except for immorality and marries another woman commits adultery
665352 truly i say to you there is no one who has left house or brothers or mother or father or children or farms for my sake and for the gospels sake but that he will receive a hundred times as much now in the present age houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms along with persecutions and in the age to come eternal life but many who are first will be last and the last first
665353 city and all that is within it shall be devoted to the lord for destruction
665354 keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction lest when you have devoted them you take any of the devoted things and make the camp of israel a thing for destruction and bring trouble upon it
665355 there are things under the ban in your midst o israel you cannot stand before your enemies until you have removed the things under the ban from your midst
665356 it shall be that the one who is taken with the things under the ban shall be burned with fire he and all that belongs to him because he has transgressed the covenant of the lord and because he has committed a disgraceful thing in israel
665357 having these promises dear friends let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit perfecting holiness out of reverence for god
665358 in all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight
665359 if anyone is ashamed of me and my words the son of man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the father and of the holy angels
665360 for such men are false apostles deceitful workers disguising themselves as apostles of christ no wonder for even satan disguises himself as an angel of light therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness whose end will be according to their deeds
665361 be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock among which the holy spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of god which he purchased with his own blood

665419 if he wants to change his mind he is entitled to do so in his own good time and he will let us know in his own good time
665420 i would be rolling out the red carpet for him tomorrow if he wanted to stay in the parliament but its all hypothetical because he hasnt given us any indication other than the one back in december that he was going
665421 we all wish that he would come back but he has given no indication that he would

665433 the pilots followed standard procedures which is go back and land safely
665434 the 767 has three hydraulic systems if one fails the other two back it up there was never any safety issue here
665435 this is an additional layer of safety checks over and above the normal day to day checks
665436 if there are significant problems the public has a right to know
665437 we have no issue with this latest review and casa says it has no evidence to suggest that safety standards at qantas have fallen

665440 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
665441 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
665442 as near as we can tell looking at the historical record theres been ice in the arctic in the summer for at least 16 million years
665443 theres a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 well have an ice free summer arctic as soon as that its astounding whats happened
665444 as the ice recedes its opening up not only the arctic passage but all the resources in the arctic ocean
665445 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
665446 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
665447 the arctic really can feed back into the global climate system
665448 you know what happens when you get feedbacks you get surprises and we dont like surprises
665449 a race has developed between the waning sunlight and the weakened ice
665450 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
665451 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
665452 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
665453 we should care in the sense that what happens here is coming to us and sometimes you know a warning is a helpful thing to mobilise people

665549 we do not have enough doctors and enough operational theaters it takes some time before all patients get access to emergency treatment

665580 i had been waiting for a calm day and last night seemed perfect
665581 i paddled out and got past cromer pier then brought the oars in and got down on one knee
665582 it was perfect miriam cried and said yes it was wonderful
665583 i had bought a vintage diamond ring and it fitted miriam perfectly the sun was setting we even had a rainbow
665584 then about 10 minutes later our plans were disrupted when a man on a fishing boat said the coastguard had been called and that he would take us ashore
665585 i was dressed in a tweed waistcoat and bow tie said mr howell who works as a currency designer in london
665586 i have quite a few friends in cromer and thought this is not what i want to be seen to be doing
665587 there were a few cheers when we got back to the beach

665594 i knew that the value of the company was billions of dollars however the deceptive practice of hiding myspace financials by intermix management robbed shareholders of their opportunity to adequately gauge the companys value
665595 before making an application default on we require a few things access to the sites structured data through semantic markup or a data feed a well designed and broadly useful application and positive user metrics
665596 to understand how a searchmonkey app affects user metrics we generally expose a small percentage of our users to a default on experience and measure if and how it changes their usage we started with yelp linkedin and yahoo local because they were among our first partners to share structured data
665597 our tests uncovered that users found these apps useful in fact in some cases we saw a lift in click through rate of as high as 15 percent
665598 huge exodus of work that used to be done in offices and face to face and it is starting to move online
665599 the item youve requested is not currently available in the us store
665600 you may not have noticed but the old back end was getting creaky under the load of 5 million users
665601 weve seen a zillion different confusions and misspellings of del icio us over the years for example de licio us del icio us com and del licio us so moving to delicious com will make it easier for people to find the site and share it with their friends
665602 imagine if two completely separate things your bank statements and your calendar spoke the same language and could share information with one another you could drag one on top of the other and a whole bunch of dots would appear showing you when you spent your money
665603 we have worked on a lot of simplification reducing the clutter and we still need to reduce more twine has a lot of powerful features nobody uses so we are moving some of the advanced features out of the way
665604 the fall release will bring more intelligence and semantics to the surface for example we will let anyone define a new type of thing such as a recipe or baseball team form to author its more like what freebase does and we will also likely integrate with freebase over time
665605 a major focus of our work is on personalization and recommendations
665606 ultimately twine is about interest networking and is a content distribution network people declare their interests add content join twines and connect with people as users work with the system it learns about their interests using artificial intelligence and semantic web technologies to provide more relevance we are not attempting to index the whole web just the best stuff of interest to users ninety nine percent of whats on the web is not interesting to a user so its more about high signal to noise
665607 the goal for twine is to be the place on the web that best understands your interests and represents them to others the key is to give users control and privacy

665613 the rba will be paying close attention to the employment data with any significant fall in employment likely to increase the probability of a rate cut coming before the end of 2008
665614 both jess and lisa have had an incredibly difficult week and without doubt i am talking to them and helping them out where i can
665615 from the whole situation with the pictures to lisas break up with dean i cant even imagine how they are coping with it all
665616 what has happened with those images is obviously completely illegal and there are lawyers getting involved
665617 its just such an upsetting situation there is a real tall poppy situation in australia and both jess and lisa deserve more support especially from their australian fans
665618 at the moment they are being advised not to say anything because theyre still getting their head around it themselves its all been pretty crazy
665619 but if things keep progressing between them they wont have a problem discussing it further down the track
665620 its far better to set some ambitious goals even if from time to time you fall short i commend andrew for his ambition
665621 ive canvassed particularly the leaders and in many cases the owners of those companies and what ive found myself pushing against is an open door
665622 ive been talking up hill and down dale for many years about the scourge of welfare and the deep need for our people to engage in the opportunities of australias incredible economy
665623 it was a complete hit to the solar plexus when andrew proposed not a few thousand real jobs in a timeframe but 50 000 guaranteed real jobs
665624 there is always going to be a lot of attention this is the biggest sports event in the world
665625 for me going for three in a row in the 1500m freestyle i knew there would be a lot of attention and expectation this makes the commonwealth games or the world championships look like a one out of 10
665626 i told them you are going to get emotionally up and you are going to have to bring yourself down quickly
665627 we have 20 million people at home hoping we do very well
665628 this will bring it home to the kids that the whole world will be watching them
665629 the more experienced guys are used to that but the young guys like cate campbell will have walked through very wide eyed
665630 the bank is in very strong shape and at an operating level things are going extremely well but thats a matter for us to sit down and talk to the ratings agencies about and to assure them thats the case
665631 theyre currently rated triple a and double a that is the majority of those investments are rated more highly than the credit rating of any australian company or bank
665632 i guess its understandable from the point of view of taking some losses back in 2004 and taking another loss now at least a provision last week but from the reaction i get outside theres an increased understanding of the difficult state of the world at the moment
665633 people who are familiar with the financial sector understand whats happening around the world and have seen the results in the write downs by banks all over the place far greater write downs fortunately than weve had to make
665634 im not going to apologise for something the ioc is not responsible for
665635 we are not running the internet in china chinese authorities are running the internet in china
665636 we are idealists and idealism is something that is linked with naivety but we fight for causes that we think are important and we want the media to work in the best possible way
665637 if we allow political propaganda its the end of the harmony of the olympic village and the end of the harmony of the games
665638 these are 17 cheats that will not falsify the competition this is not a trend it is a deliberate policy
665639 today we have absolutely no concerns about the organisation no regrets come the ninth of august the magic of the games and the flawless organisation will take over
665640 while the recent credit crunch has obviously had a significant impact on the local money market there is limited evidence to suggest the costs of funding are still increasing
665641 the major banks have not only survived but strengthened thanks to the credit crisis becoming the market price setter for the first time since they relinquished that position to the specialist home loan lenders more than a decade ago

665645 aluka is around three and four months pregnant and with a gestation period of 16 to 18 months we can expect a calf between august and october next year
665646 the new arrival will weigh around 70kg at birth and will reach two tonne in five years
665647 the baby will be the 11th white rhino born at western plains zoo
665648 he winced shaking his fist as if it held a rattle
665649 my dad taught me all these lessons because he was there
665650 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
665651 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
665652 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
665653 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
665654 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
665655 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
665656 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
665657 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
665658 mr jones of the manor farm had locked the hen houses for the night but was too drunk to remember to shut the pop holes
665659 once there were three patients who met in a hospital and decided to live together
665660 when things got too crazy with the cops i suggested to timmy penn that we go to college but he just laughed and said skinheads were working class for life
665661 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
665662 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
665663 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
665664 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
665665 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
665666 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
665667 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
665668 all three occupants of the punto a man and a woman in their 40s and a teenaged boy were taken to hospital critically injured
665669 since then the man and the boy have died from the injuries they sustained the woman is described as being in a serious but stable condition
665670 it is not believed anyone else was seriously injured in the collision
665671 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
665672 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
665673 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
665674 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
665675 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
665676 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
665677 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
665678 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
665679 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
665680 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
665681 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
665682 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
665683 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
665684 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
665685 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
665686 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
665687 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
665688 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
665689 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
665690 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
665691 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
665692 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
665693 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
665694 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
665695 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
665696 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
665697 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
665698 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
665699 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
665700 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
665701 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
665702 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
665703 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
665704 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
665705 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
665706 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
665707 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
665708 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
665709 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
665710 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
665711 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
665712 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
665713 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
665714 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
665715 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
665716 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
665717 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
665718 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
665719 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
665720 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
665721 has zero to do with education and sends a message intolerance and bigotry to students faculty and the community
665722 weve seen people jumping into the water far too often its very dangerous there are rocks and strong currents its lucky that we had the rescue boat on the water and that we were there to help
665723 the fire service would always stress the dangers of jumping into or swimming in lakes and reservoirs in summer
665724 there are good reasons to go through pregnancy the ability to breastfeed for one and also the pair bonding hormones that flood your body during and after birth
665725 you can only bring a horse to the water you cant make it drink
665726 location based mobile social networking revenues will reach 3 3 billion by 2013 but successful business models may differ from what many observers expect
665727 while location based advertising integrated with sophisticated algorithms holds a lot of promise the current reality rather points to licensing and revenue sharing models as the way forward for social networking start ups to grow their customer base and reach profitability recent evidence the agreements between gypsii and both garmin and samsung similarly loopt has established partnerships with all major us cellular carriers

665771 although abu khabab is gone he left behind him a generation who will seek revenge and punishment with gods help
665772 and while the expert is gone he left behind experts who were taught and trained under his hands throughout the years

665774 some of these training manuals were recovered by u s forces in afghanistan
665775 mao was responsible for well over 70 million deaths of the chinese in peacetime and he was as evil as hitler or stalin
665776 and he did as much damage to mankind as hitler and stalin
665777 in china we interviewed about 150 of maos inner circle in maos family relatives friends
665778 i did not realize how much of the misery and hardship he caused was done knowingly and so ruthlessly in terms of his own personal interests
665779 he said in his later life i was lying in the litter
665780 whoever linked up with moscow had the communications with moscow and was recognized by moscow as the party leader would be the boss
665781 so at the end of the long march mao is number one
665782 well stalin i think spotted mao as probably the guy in the chinese communist party most like himself
665783 and of course mao also like stalin had long range vision i mean mao could think strategically he was very very smart
665784 and mao didnt want to stop he said for all his projects to take off half of china may well have to die
665785 and when he was shown the report of you know food shortages of peasants starving mao said educate the peasant to eat less
665786 he even said death have benefit they can fertilize the land
665787 it brought trauma misery torture death to hundreds of millions of people
665788 my father was one of the few who stood up to mao and opposed the cultural revolution
665789 and as a result he was arrested tortured driven insane and he was exiled to a camp and died very young
665790 she went through over a hundred of those denunciation meetings
665791 and she was made to kneel on broken glass and she was paraded in the streets where children spat at her and threw stones at her
665792 instead he would have his servants his mistresses wiping him every day with a hot towel
665793 he didnt like to wash his hair either and he liked this slightly itchy feeling
665794 you know we were told that socialist china was paradise on earth
665795 i blamed people around mao i blamed madame mao but i could never contemplate mao
665796 how do you explain the economic miracle thats transformed china
665797 the economic miracles happened because mao died and people had had enough of living under maos kind of rule
665798 they became more equal in you know basically slave labor
665799 if theres one criticism that has come to light in the book is that theres such an unrelenting sort of attack on mao
665800 well one way to answer that would be to say no
665801 should one be even handed about hitler for example i mean mao did what he did
665802 i mean they think he is still the great hero
665803 so the truth of mao really isnt out in the open in china even now 30 years after his death
665804 the object of the bombardment seemingly was demoralization of the civilian population
665805 the whole of it was a horrible sight flaming from end to end
665806 in the united states prominent americans from all walks of life and a large portion of the press joined in a denunciation of the monstrous crime of guernica while congressional leaders renewed their appeal for the application of the neutrality act to berlin and rome
665807 a deliberate effort to use air power as an instrument of terrorism
665808 deeply deplores the bombardment of the civil population in the spanish civil war wherever it may occur and whoever may be responsible
665809 a chorus of protest in the house of lords over the atrocity
665810 there is no precedent in the history of civilized nations for anything like the bombing of guernica
665811 achieve the maximum effect on morale by striking at the most sensitive part of the german population namely the working class
665812 drop their eggs well into the middle of the town generally
665813 aerial bombardment for the purpose of terrorizing the civilian population of destroying or damaging private property not of military character or of injuring non combatants
665814 the bombardment by naval forces of undefended ports towns villages dwellings or buildings
665815 no excuse can be made for such acts which have aroused horror and indignation throughout the world
665816 the view that any general bombing of an extensive area wherein there resides a large populace engaged in peaceful pursuits is unwarranted and contrary to principles of law and of humanity
665817 soldiers women children cattle rivers lakes and pastures were drenched continually with this deadly rain in tens of thousands the victims of the italian mustard gas fell
665818 britain will never resort to the deliberate attack on women and children and other civilians for the purpose of mere terrorism
665819 similar treatment of the germans is the only thing they will understand
665820 a new and intensified hatred of germany in the people of london
665821 should now be focused on the morale of the enemy civilian population and in particular of industrial workers
665822 i suppose it is clear that the new aiming points are to be the built up residential areas not for instance the dockyards or aircraft factories
665823 there is one thing that will bring hitler down and that is an absolutely devastating exterminating attack by very heavy bombers from this country upon the nazi homeland
665824 operations should now be focused on the morale of the enemy civil population
665825 6 000 acres of smoking ashes and rubble 41 800 people killed and another 37 000 injured
665826 definitely not you are to look for and aim at military targets only such as war industries ship building facilities power plants and the like there is absolutely nothing to be gained by attacking residential areas
665827 to the point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened
665828 during the day the u s a f bombers attacked military and industrial targets in the dock areas and in particular the shipyards and submarine yards
665829 i noticed uneasily that there were no suffering and dying enemy civilians under all those proud promises of bombs no civilians at all in fact
665830 we were not bombing tenements for the sadistic pleasure of killing as the nazis did but blowing to bits carefully selected targets factories shipyards munitions dumps
665831 nothing and no one was safe combatants civilians women children cities churches the great historical monuments
665832 no physical or moral boundaries would be able to check the spread of slaughter
665833 to examine themselves concerning their participation in this carnival of death
665834 the realities of what is being done in our name in europe
665835 commander of the strategic air force obliged by ordering the eighth air force to strike berlin not the industries of berlin not the marshalling yards of berlin but the city center the heart of german government and an area of high population density
665836 protested that such an attack would be terrorism without any justification on military grounds spaatz however wasnt prepared to discuss it he insisted the attack go ahead
665837 an increased interest in attacks directed specifically at the german people
665838 the most striking moral paradox of the war years was the willingness of ostensibly liberal states to engage in the deliberate killing of hundreds of thousands of enemy civilians from the air
665839 these bombardments create the impression that the whole world has gone totalitarian
665840 it marked the first all out effort to burn down a great city and destroy its people
665841 a single bomb of this type carried by boat and exploded in port might very well destroy the whole port together with some surrounding territory
665842 roosevelt consistently supported the manufacture and use of the atomic bomb atomic bomb or a bomb weapon deriving its explosive force from the release of atomic energy through the fission splitting of heavy nuclei see nuclear energy the first atomic bomb was produced at the los alamos n mex laboratory and successfully tested on july 16 1945 this was the culmination of a large u s army program that was part of the manhattan project led by dr robert oppenheimer
665843 at no time from 1941 to 1945 did i ever hear it suggested by the president or by any other responsible member of government that atomic energy should not be used in the war
665844 for making the tremendous decision to go the length of spending 2 billion in developing the atomic bomb
665845 at a meeting with stimson on december 30 1944 fdr approved the production and testing of the bombs and the training of the crews of the 509th composite bomber group
665846 prior to the war i had the illusion that up to a point the american government was different
665847 are guided by considerations of expediency rather than by moral considerations then during the war without any explanation we began to use incendiary bombs against the cities of japan this was disturbing to me and it was disturbing many of my scientific friends
665848 horrible and destructive as this weapon was described to be
665849 the decision to use the atomic bomb to compel the surrender of japan was never an issue there was unanimous automatic unquestioned agreement around our table nor did i ever hear the slightest suggestion that we should do otherwise
665850 it might perhaps after mature consideration be used against the japanese who should be warned that this bombardment will be repeated until they surrender
665851 the final decision of where and when to use the atomic bomb was up to me
665852 so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children
665853 it wasnt necessary to hit them with that awful thing
665854 in my opinion it was for one very simple reason it saved lives a land invasion of japan would have cost both sides hundreds of thousands of casualties
665855 we scorched and boiled and baked to death more people in tokyo on that night of march 9 10 than went up in vapor at hiroshima and nagasaki combined
665856 but to worry about the morality of what we were doing nuts i can recognize no more depravity in dropping a nuclear weapon than in having a v 2 rocket equipped with an orthodox warhead and shooting it vaguely in the general direction of london as the germans did no difference whatsoever

665871 timo dein erster podiumsplatz in der formel 1 was ist das f r ein gef hl
665872 es ist einfach unglaublich zur halbzeit meiner ersten saison auf dem podium zu stehen es war f r mich ein perfektes wochenende
665873 hattest du in den letzten zwei runden die h nde noch am lenkrad oder hast du versucht dich mit der einen hand zu kneifen
665874 ich habe irgendwann den funkspruch bekommen dass kimi langsamer gemacht hat man hat mir dann auch gesagt ich soll ein bisschen langsamer fahren und das auto nach hause bringen
665875 das podium ist genial super f r das team sehr wichtig f r die konstrukteurs wm
665876 es ist dann meistens schwierig sich weiterhin zu konzentrieren und keinen fehler zu machen ich habe das aber in den letzten zwei runden einigerma en hinbekommen und konnte es in der letzten runde immer noch nicht glauben das podium ist genial super f r das team sehr wichtig f r die konstrukteurs wm mein auto war von anfang bis ende perfekt ich kann es noch gar nicht glauben in meinem ersten jahr so ein erfolg
665877 wir haben einige funkspr che geh rt wie oft hat es denn das kommando push gegeben
665878 das kam schon ein paar mal ich habe im ersten und zweiten stint viel gepusht und habe nat rlich gewusst dass wir mit dem harten reifen viel zeit gutmachen k nnen weil wir mit dem weichen einfach probleme hatten speziell ich ich habe das ganze wochenende nicht das gef hl f r die weichen reifen bekommen als felipe massa ein paar runden vor meinem boxenstopp vor mir rauskam haben wir gesagt dass wir ein paar runden fr her reinkommen da war die strategie ein bisschen ein chaos felipe hat mich aufgehalten da sind wir dann auch fr her zur box gegangen zum schluss waren wir aber safe
665879 mit kimi wurde es noch einmal schwierig denn er war um eine sekunde pro runde schneller da dachte ich schon oh wei ich habe versucht noch einmal zu pushen habe aber sofort den reifen berfahren es war so schwierig ich war dann ehrlich gesagt ein bisschen froh als ich felipe stehen sah nat rlich hart f r felipe aber gut f r mich weil kimi dann ein bisschen zur ckgedreht hat
665880 was ging dir durch den kopf als kimi r ikk nen im r ckspiegel immer gr er wurde
665881 im gp2 rennen steckte ich im vorjahr mitten im feld fest ich hatte ein gutes auto konnte aber niemanden berholen und in der formel 1 ist das berholen noch schwieriger ich habe ihn also im spiegel gesehen und wusste dass ich jetzt halt keinen fehler machen darf
665882 ich h tte nie gedacht dass ich von platz f nf auf das podium fahren k nnte
665883 h ttest du nach dem guten qualifying mit rang f nf gedacht dass das rennen f r dich noch so viel besser laufen k nnte
665884 ich h tte nie gedacht dass ich von platz f nf auf das podium fahren k nnte aber ich hatte einen guten speed bis in die endphase des rennens als ich mit meinem letzten reifensatz dann unter druck von kimi geraten bin ich hatte schon in hockenheim ein gutes auto in der rennabstimmung das ich an meinen stil angepasst hatte das konnte ich hier im qualifying und im rennen best tigen
665885 in deiner heimat im odenwald steigt eine formel 1 party was ist da heute los und wie wirst du heute feiern

665922 we tell the enemies of god that god has saved those who will be even more painful for you
665923 as abu khabab has gone he left behind with gods grace a generation of faithful students who will make you suffer the worst torture and avenge him and his brothers
665924 it has never been done before i doubt it will be repeated this is it weve got a golden opportunity to fast forward our research
665925 i immediately jumped off my seat i thought this is what ive been waiting for i said thank god for the olympics for me this is 10 times better than winning the lottery
665926 if mother nature cooperates i expect there would be an impact but it all depends on the wind directions
665927 its a giant science experiment on air pollution as far as i know its the biggest case where a city that had air quality problems took strong measures to improve air quality theyve taken it very seriously its exciting from a science standpoint
665928 they didnt have to go to quite the extremes that beijing has beijing has had to come a long way further than l a or atlanta
665929 its not just about china its about megacities across the world whats learned here can perhaps be applied to other cities
665930 hopefully with our data china can see the need to take a dramatic policy strategy to continue the good policies they conducted during the games
665931 at the time it was built it was the most elaborate warsaw pact protective structure outside the soviet union
665932 president bush has been working with the iraqis to encourage them to work out their differences and get the provincial elections law passed
665933 to that end he spoke to several senior iraqi officials yesterday as they near the end of the legislative process both to offer encouragement and stress the importance of getting the law through the final stages of the legislative process
665934 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
665935 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
665936 it was a democratic process why did they reject it
665937 we arabs are against any new resolution that could affect our presence in this city
665938 i hope the sky can stay blue like this both during and after the olympic games
665939 this will give foreigners a good impression of the city and leave a legacy to beijing citizens
665940 its much better than i expected theres none of the gunk in the air
665941 there is a little haze in the air but that reminds me of los angeles in 1984 but its nothing like ive been reading about
665942 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
665943 a safe olympics is also a key indicator of the positive reflection of our nations image
665944 protest by athletes doesnt really mar the games because that is something even the ioc would be opposed to
665945 but i think major protests that the chinese put down in front of television cameras particularly if they are foreign protesters that could look very bad
665946 when you are the biggest country in the world and youre an illiberal regime and youre hosting the olympics then its bound to be political
665947 these multibillion dollar iconic olympic facilities are meant to show that china is not simply the great wall its modern its powerful its a player
665948 if i dont have written proof of something we have to take for granted the passports that weve seen and have been checked by the ioc are ok
665949 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes
665950 its not the task of the ioc to check every one of the 10 000 athletes
665951 its just as grave and just as brutal like cheating with doping
665952 the international gymnastics federation strictly verified their passports and confirmed that their ages met the age rules for participating in the world championship world cup and olympics
665953 a passport does nothing passports at this point in china is nothing they can do anything
665954 i dont believe you have to be a child psychologist or doctor to look at those particular girls and say wait a minute these are kids they are not 16 years old not a doubt in my mind

665957 the bank is by stanford mall that is a good bank to hit because it is so close to the freeway
665958 this case is not formally linked to the murder but the timing is suspicious
665959 why is it that four days after the murder of his wife they rush forward with these charges the government has rushed forward to go after him when hes vulnerable because of this tragedy
665960 if theres a way to make them have a healthier lifestyle so i dont pay for it i would be open to it
665961 the profession and the rest of us are better off if sources know that they run the risk of being unmasked if their mendacity is egregious enough to become newsworthy in its own right
665962 id say that part of ross re reporting ought to include a full explanation of exactly who was peddling the bentonite lie in the first place and why they were doing it
665963 in practice most journalists refuse to identify their sources under any circumstances at all even when its clear that those sources deliberately lied to them
665964 that details of the interception first published in a newsweek cover story were leaked by none other than colonel north himself
665965 the whole game of reporters and their confidential sources has gone so far in washington that too many of us have forgotten our first obligation its not to the oliver norths of the world and the reporters protecting them its to readers and viewers and yes to the truth
665966 many other reporters were mad at me but some commentators rightly pointed out that some values the obligation of reporters to their readers superseded the reporter source relationship and that if you used that relationship as a cover for lying you broke the implicit contract
665967 in this instance where the source publicly accuses someone else of leaking a story for devious purposes its incumbent upon you to set the record straight
665968 if a shield law is put in place irresponsible journalists can print anything and get away with destroying lives

665972 there is some indication and i dont have the conclusions but some of this anthrax may and i emphasize may have come from iraq
665973 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program

666005 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
666006 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
666007 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
666008 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
666009 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two

666048 dairy and other foods that are rich in calcium are thought to be important for the growth and strengthening of bones in children and adolescents
666049 in the us dairy products tend to be the preferred source of calcium since diets that exclude dairy are often deficient in this important nutrient the new findings show that for those children who have inadequate calcium intake increasing dietary calcium has a significant impact on bone development since most children dont get enough calcium meeting calcium recommendations may help to prevent future osteoporosis
666050 the evaluation of randomized controlled trials was critical to understand the effects of calcium and dairy on childrens bone health
666051 the literature has been unclear in this area because of the different ways researchers have measured bone health or inconclusive because many studies examined the effects of supplementation in children who were already consuming adequate amounts of dairy foods
666052 its never too early to make bone health a priority these findings continue to support the research that shows milk is an important source of calcium which helps build and maintain strong bones muscles and teeth in children
666053 consuming 3 servings of low fat or fat free dairy foods each day gives children not only the calcium they need but also eight other essential nutrients including potassium phosphorus and protein

666395 we fought hard today and we were on the pace with a car that was working well which is encouraging for the rest of the championship we scored some important points which is satisfying even though we could have maybe been on the podium we must now continue working hard but todays result shows that we are moving in the right direction
666396 i am happy with my result this weekend i scored some valuable points which is promising for the rest of the season i made a good start but unfortunately i made a small mistake on the first lap which meant that i lost the two positions that i had made up it shows that at this level you cannot afford to make the smallest error i am continuing to learn and i am determined to continue building on this progress when we go to valencia at the end of the month

666409 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
666410 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
666411 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
666412 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
666413 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two

666486 ive got a decision to make and its one im keeping close to my chest at the moment
666487 obviously it was a very difficult race for us we converted my strategy to a one stopper which was the right thing to do so thanks to the team for that after that though i was running heavy and struggling on the option tyres so had to fight for pace i then made contact with fisichella and lost a position fortunately i was able to regain it when he had to make his final stop that was all we could do today so we need to look into what happened and try to improve for the next race
666488 my first lap wasnt great i was in the wrong place and lost a few positions then during my first pit stop something went wrong with the fuel rig which cost me a couple of decisive seconds and put me behind fisichella my strategy was over then in terms of the heat i didnt have a problem with it weve definitely had worse races this year
666489 what an incredible feeling i couldnt believe it when i saw felipes engine go and i was p2 to get such a good result in my first year is fantastic so a huge thank you to all the team including the engineers mechanics and everyone at the factory i knew from qualifying that we had good speed and weve looked strong all weekend today i made a good start and gained a place into the first corner i had a really good car and everything went perfectly until the last stint on the soft tyres i was struggling a lot and soon i had kimi behind me but i knew from last year here in gp2 when i was stuck in the midfield in a really good car how hard it is to pass here so when i saw him in the mirrors i knew i couldnt afford any mistakes this result more than makes up for hockenheim and now we must keep picking up regular points until the end of the season
666490 this is a very good result for us and to pick up ten points is great for the constructors championship im glad for timo because he has had a very good weekend and fully deserves this result this could have been better for me too despite my problems in qualifying i was quick today but i couldnt push because i only had one lap that was clear of traffic in the whole afternoon i gained one position early on but overtaking is practically impossible here around the second stops i was also stuck behind lewis holding me up further still im delighted that we are showing such strong form and i just hope we can carry on in good shape and with such good results
666491 i really cant find the words to celebrate this result the best of our season we had a few difficulties in practice but during qualifying the drivers pushed themselves to the limit and things got better and better today timo did a fantastic race we saw immediately that his car was quick and and his third stint was almost perfect he was under threat from kimi but he was quick in the third sector and he was able to fend him off jarno was quick as well and pushed hard but he was blocked for most of the race he couldnt show his pace until briefly in the last stint so this is a stunning performance and my thanks go out to the whole team and everyone working in the factory im very appreciative of all their hard work and next we will aim for the centre of the podium
666492 this was a difficult race we were very slow and i was struggling with the overall grip of the car i had massive oversteer and could not really push i was trying hard to keep the car on the track anyway one point is better than nothing
666493 my start wasnt perfect but okay as i had hoped i was able to overtake three cars on the first lap but later it became more difficult than expected to race with the heavy car we went for a one stop strategy so my car was almost full of fuel at the start and i also had to take care of the tyres i couldnt match the pace of the cars in front of me now we have to analyse todays lack of race pace normally this is one of our strengths
666494 we were completely off the pace during the race neither driver was able to do the lap times we expected after the sessions on friday and saturday it was the same on both tyre compounds the reason for that is currently not clear but we shall analyse everything congratulations to heikki kovalainen for his maiden win in f1 and of course timo glock for his strong weekend crowned by finishing second

666500 india is one of the biggest aid donors to afghanistan
666501 from a geopolitical and aid stand the issue for india will be about how to improve security as ties grow closer
666502 looking at the weekend as a whole we have made good progress and can take a lot away from here unfortunately the race was frustrating i made it tough for myself with a poor start which dropped me down to p14 after the first couple of corners i got boxed in at turn 1 and had a lot of wheelspin out of the corner which allowed a few people to get past on the outside i was able to get past rubens on lap three which was fun but after that i quickly came up to the back of heidfeld he was very strong on the last two corners so i had no chance to overtake on the track and he was on a one stop strategy however in clean air our pace was good so this weekend is a definite step forward and i am reasonably happy with the outcome
666503 after a good start where i made up four positions on the opening lap unfortunately it wasnt a very exciting race for me we decided to start with used front and new rear tyres which proved to be a problem as the car was out of balance for the first stint then at my first pitstop we were unlucky to have the problem with the rig which resulted in a small fire and a long delay whilst we got fuel into the car using the second rig after that my race was effectively over as the number of blue flags made it impossible to make progress we decided to drop the revs on the engine and do some testing with the tyres as we had overheating problems over the weekend and it was good to collect some data on this for me the actual race was one to forget really
666504 todays race was never going to be easy from our grid positions from the first lap both drivers were held up by heidfeld who was running on a different strategy and this prevented them from using their true pace the new developments that we brought to hungary have definitely helped us to improve the performance of the car as is always the case though the rest of the field isnt standing still and we do not yet have the pace to score points on our own merit
666505 we werent quick enough we didnt do a good enough job in qualifying yesterday which hurt us in the race we struggled to find pace and it was hard to stay with the toyotas and renaults who were fighting in the championship lets hope its this track though and that we can bounce back in valencia
666506 unfortunately i got some traffic before my last stop which allowed nick heidfeld to pass me otherwise i couldnt do anymore today the car has a lot of oversteer and rear sliding now well just focus on the next race and see that we can do there
666507 a disappointing race unfortunately we just werent fast enough and it was a circuit that didnt play to our strengths our nearest rivals both had respectable scores today but well be pushing hard to recover lost ground in the remaining races

666558 the palestinians are raising doubts over their readiness to establish an independent state and this is how the palestinian people are portrayed in the world

666572 we would not need a surge and we would not have lost the lifes of 4 000 soldiers if they would have just done their jobs in washington
666573 lies lies and more lies i am so sick of them
666574 posse comitatus act prohibits what mccain is saying the military is not allowed to enforce civilian laws this is the law that protects the us from becoming a military regime

666578 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move
666579 my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
666580 at the end of the day your reporter was in the wrong place i do not know why the other reporters were not moved the rest of the local press should have been moved as well

666585 he looked in good touch when he was with us but he got out early in a couple of tests and it is just a matter of him spending time in the middle and hopefully he will be able to do that with us and get back on track
666586 i dont by any means think that it is the end of his career it seems he wants to go on playing but i have not yet spoken to him
666587 michael vaughan is a quality player and you dont become a bad player overnight it will be great if he can come back and score runs for us
666588 i am very disappointed for michael vaughan and for england because i thought he was an excellent captain and leader
666589 i said on my radio show last week that i thought he should stay on as england captain
666590 he is a terrific player and like collingwood is probably only one innings away from resurrecting his form
666591 the pickup in unemployment reduces employee bargaining power suggesting slower wage growth in the near term
666592 this should relieve some of the inflation pressure but also hinder consumers
666593 more must be done to prime the economys pump and put america back to work
666594 our economy continues to work its way through current challenges
666595 the resiliency of the economy given all the shocks we have sustained is noteworthy
666596 i didnt really know i was what the show was looking for
666597 i had watched in the past and never seen a rocker win the show and to me it was kind of like if somebody like bo bice or somebody like chris daughtry cant come on here and win it what shot do i have
666598 i dont know what my last name is i assume its archuleta
666599 we love coming to ohio weve been there several times
666600 before i got married i was like i wanna have kids right away and then i got married and i was like no it might have had something to do with wearing the preggie pad for two months so thank you house bunny
666601 shes my idol i voted for her from the start of the show and now i get to see her
666602 help is on the way 14 blame it on the movies
666603 we need to come back strongly in the next test
666604 three hundred and seven on this wicket was a gettable score but the middle order couldnt get it together after the three quick wickets at the top
666605 credit to the bowlers but its the batting that let us down
666606 we have come back before we have quality in the team there is no doubt about that
666607 there are couple of areas to improve but overall very satisfied with the result the review is a good system there are couple of areas to look into and captains will sit together to discuss
666608 it is like assisted evolution if you gave evolution long enough we would adapt to have smaller stomachs and bowels this just produces it more quickly
666609 this is a procedure that can transform lives it can cure diabetes people may say it is an expensive operation but in reality it is cheap because it pays for itself in three years through reduction in illness
666610 we are facing lot of problems due to the curfew there is no conveyance available for us to go back the government has done no arrangements for us
666611 we had taken nine vehicles full of people and when we were just a few kilometers away from katra some people attacked us and asked us to go away as they were planning protests even though curfew was clamped in the city we came back with great difficulty after saving our lives
666612 of course i feel a bit sorry for felipe because what happened to him has happened to me a few times this year
666613 but im very happy today of course after working through all the hard times along with my team
666614 massa and lewis were very fast today but halfway through things were working better for me i just tried to put pressure on massa at the end and try to make something happen which it did with what looked like a mechanical failure
666615 basically the torch symbolizes hopes and aspirations of tibetan people this is being organized by all the tibet support groups around the world and then this we want to shift the spotlight at the moment when the whole media attention is at china and we want to take this as a platform to highlight the issue of tibet and to show the reality that is happening behind all these closed doors
666616 today is the seventh day six hundred hunger strikers who are participating in this campaign to represent the six million tibetan people and they are here with five demands and several appeals to the international community we are demanding immediate end to the brutal suppression of tibetans by the chinese government we also demand immediate end of dumping of liquor and other toxic wastes in tibet
666617 open minded and open source volunteer supported by people who love lj
666618 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
666619 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
666620 i have never felt self congratulatory in any way about my involvement because it did precipitate a conflict which eventually claimed 3 500 lives and that is inescapable
666621 it would be very cruel to say that what we have ended up with is a twilight home in east belfast for retired gunmen but are relations today between the communities really that different
666622 im just not convinced that the outcome we do have is any better than what we wouldve had had the march not went ahead
666623 the thought that this would lead to a re emergence of militant irish nationalism which would in turn bring about the resurgence of militant loyalism would simply never even have occurred to us
666624 what this was about and what it has returned to was equality of citizenship history will record the provisional iras campaign as a continuation of the civil rights movement by inappropriate means
666625 between the pomposity of bew and the extravagance of mccann i might look like the sane one
666626 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing children
666627 a new duty will be placed on local authorities to promote democracy local leaders will be expected to do more to help residents understand how the democratic process works and how they can get involved residents can expect to see information campaigns and town halls being opened up to councillors to hold surgeries new civic champions council staff or former councillors who will go out into the community and work with residents and community groups to increase understanding about how they can raise awareness about civic roles they can take up whether thats volunteering standing as a governor a councillor or becoming a magistrate
666628 in our own informal way weve acted more as a critical friend than fawning acolyte or jaded oppositionalist
666629 wed like to highlight the good things that are happening right now in northern ireland and the awards will aim to reward effort and interactivity with a pat on the back from the blogosphere
666630 i have left the party and the press office as i feel that the current programme for government of the stormont administration will put working class communities under increased pressure at a time when the current global credit crunch is already hurting this vulnerable group in society i also feel that the partys left wing credentials have been damaged by the above and by a continued courtship with the american administration
666631 one of the bad things about the internet is that you pay attention to your commenters
666632 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
666633 yes its a rap about particle physics yes it mentions antimatter and the bbc report an
666634 criminal and anti social elements who are using this bonfire as a cover for other activities
666635 while the provincial man looks to the opinion of the metropolis the parochial is never in any doubt about the social and artistic validity of his parish
666636 these cases are due to come before the tribunals and will be strenuously defended by ofmdfm in the circumstances it would be inappropriate to comment further
666637 if the whole world followed you would you be pleased with where you took it
666638 if ever the world actually needed a book like lost girls its probably around now
666639 in the right hands sargent that could be a deadly weapon
666640 in the right hands sargent that could be a deadly weapon
666641 yes but in the wrong hands it might be even more deadly
666642 the jews gt should have offered themselves to the butchers knife
666643 they gt should have thrown themselves into the sea from cliffs
666644 relentlessly seeking relevant and the latest information constantly looking for new leads
666645 was a politically motivated action to disrupt anwar ibrahims political career
666646 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
666647 deep fried centipedes crickets grasshoppers scorpions silkworms and starfish most of these snacks were neatly arranged kebab style on wooden skewers
666648 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
666649 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
666650 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
666651 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
666652 sie waren gut versorgt aber niemand wollte in die geschlossene abteilung gehen
666653 sie hatten ein eigenes zimmer da mussten sie sich die ganze zeit aufhalten
666654 elizabeth drive durfte die tageszeitung erst haben wenn alle anderen sie gelesen hatten und sie besa einen kleinen fernseher das war die einzige verg nstigung ihres lebens sie bekam nie besuch
666655 dass die frauen eine bedrohung der ffentlichen gesundheit darstellten ist bertrieben
666656 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
666657 a grand salon a throwback to new york of old
666658 ask the average guy if he knows or has heard of rubin chances are he has but not rattner
666659 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
666660 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
666661 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
666662 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
666663 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
666664 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
666665 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
666666 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
666667 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
666668 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
666669 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
666670 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
666671 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
666672 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
666673 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
666674 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
666675 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
666676 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
666677 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
666678 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
666679 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
666680 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
666681 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
666682 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
666683 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
666684 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
666685 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
666686 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
666687 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
666688 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
666689 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
666690 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
666691 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
666692 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
666693 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
666694 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
666695 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
666696 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
666697 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
666698 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
666699 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
666700 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
666701 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
666702 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
666703 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
666704 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
666705 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
666706 it was made into a bad movie in the 1970s starring the admirable george c scott
666707 but i have always been convinced that theres a great movie in this book and this is the one we are going to make
666708 i said from the start if we got the boat right then the rest would fit into place it has to go from being a fishing boat in the first half of the film to a war vessel in the second half it was vital to me that it was genuinely built before the second world war so the hunt was on from the moment we got the go ahead for the movie
666709 its a 38ft american motor cabin cruiser a wooden hull 11 ft beam 3 ft draught a perfect match to the boat hemingway described
666710 it used to have a four cylinder flathead chrysler diesel engine but someone replaced it with a v8 general motors gasoline car engine it turned the boat into a virtual bomb it looked like a bucket of rusty bolts so i sent some guys to move it to a good boatyard
666711 it was 12 knots on a boat which was not seaworthy after a nine hour journey we navigated in by torchlight to the new yard
666712 we will then take her to an undisclosed location and protect her like an unborn child
666713 but it means that you will see 27m of the 32m on the screen there are certain things that are meant to be and if youre lucky enough in life to eventually get there then that is a great achievement this is the project that is meant to be for me
666714 i put a lot of myself in to those roles
666715 in the valley of elah was an important film because we were looking at how the iraq war impacts on local communities across america with the loss of family members its a tragedy that carries on
666716 he is so focused tommy never wants to waste time and sometimes we were having a bit too much fun for him
666717 my belief is that we should never waste a day
666718 and when you are working and acting is our work there should be total concentration on what you are trying to achieve anything less than that then you are cheating yourself and short changing others
666719 in the end i didnt think i could make it as a professional sportsman so i thought that acting could make a great alternative life
666720 its still sport of a kind with winners and losers you also have to be fit to survive its not that first or second part or even big role which is so difficult its maintaining it over years
666721 no im a private person i hate everything about this business that intrudes on my life including these interviews but i do them to promote the movies because it helps people im fond of
666722 there is a terrific battle between an 11 year old boy and a 1 000lb blue marlin which i am looking forward to filming that is when the boat comes into its own
666723 this movie might be set in the past but it is about you and me now
666724 it is not a chick flick not a thriller killer not a quirky romance
666725 i want it to be a really good movie exciting from minute to minute frame to frame this is for people who want to see something different
666726 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
666727 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
666728 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
666729 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
666730 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
666731 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
666732 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
666733 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
666734 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
666735 keeping the sales droids from trying to configure wifi or networking while at a clients location priceless
666736 you know that you cant take that seat at the front of the bus if you cant afford the bus fare you cant live in an integrated neighborhood if you cant afford the house and it doesnt mean a whole lot to sit down at that lunch counter if you cant afford the lunch
666737 id be delighted to have you because i expect that in the next administration the white house will be the peoples house
666738 people who do the work in america will never be invisible to the democratic party
666739 under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again and is going to help grow the economy right here in brevard county
666740 my commitment is to seamless transition where were utilizing the space station in an intelligent way and were preparing for the next generation of space travel
666741 ive been working barack telling him its the i 4 corridor of florida that will make a difference
666742 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
666743 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
666744 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
666745 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
666746 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
666747 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
666748 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
666749 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
666750 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
666751 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
666752 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
666753 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
666754 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
666755 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
666756 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
666757 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
666758 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
666759 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
666760 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
666761 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
666762 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
666763 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
666764 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
666765 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
666766 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
666767 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
666768 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
666769 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
666770 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
666771 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
666772 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
666773 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
666774 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
666775 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
666776 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
666777 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
666778 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
666779 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
666780 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
666781 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
666782 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
666783 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
666784 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
666785 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
666786 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
666787 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
666788 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
666789 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
666790 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
666791 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
666792 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
666793 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
666794 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
666795 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
666796 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
666797 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
666798 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
666799 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
666800 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
666801 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
666802 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
666803 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
666804 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
666805 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
666806 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
666807 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
666808 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
666809 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
666810 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
666811 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
666812 i object to the gentleman from california vote being counted he came down and voted late he said he was not in the chamber when his name was called and therefore hes not entitled to vote
666813 cleve youre wrong chet was back there behind the rail and i was standing by him when he answered his answer just wasnt heard

666820 ive always said this document and the holy bible theyve been all the guidance i need
666821 much to be thankful for theres not much i wouldnt do over
666822 we just ask that in the end gods grace shines upon us

666824 i would never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels
666825 it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
666826 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
666827 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
666828 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
666829 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
666830 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
666831 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
666832 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
666833 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
666834 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
666835 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
666836 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
666837 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
666838 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
666839 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
666840 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
666841 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
666842 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
666843 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
666844 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
666845 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
666846 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
666847 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
666848 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
666849 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
666850 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
666851 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
666852 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
666853 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
666854 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
666855 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
666856 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
666857 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
666858 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
666859 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
666860 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
666861 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
666862 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
666863 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
666864 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
666865 you dont see where all the carbon goes so there is a misconception that woody species such as trees and shrubs store more carbon thats just not the case
666866 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
666867 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
666868 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
666869 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
666870 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
666871 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
666872 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
666873 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
666874 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
666875 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
666876 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
666877 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
666878 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
666879 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
666880 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
666881 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
666882 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
666883 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
666884 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
666885 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
666886 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
666887 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
666888 a political promise to do something 40 years from now
666889 because everyone knows thats meaningless ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit the target
666890 are the very same measures needed to renew our economy
666891 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
666892 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
666893 in one month than an average american family uses in an entire year
666894 burned through enough electricity to power 232 average american households for a month
666895 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
666896 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
666897 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
666898 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
666899 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
666900 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
666901 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
666902 will attend a weekend meeting with irans chief nuclear negotiator the meeting is part of ongoing efforts to persuade iran to stop its nuclear program
666903 abba and pierce brosnan thats the best movie i have seen in a long time
666904 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
666905 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
666906 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
666907 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
666908 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
666909 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
666910 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
666911 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
666912 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
666913 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
666914 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
666915 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
666916 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
666917 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
666918 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
666919 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
666920 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
666921 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
666922 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
666923 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
666924 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
666925 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
666926 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
666927 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
666928 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
666929 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
666930 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
666931 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
666932 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
666933 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
666934 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
666935 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
666936 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
666937 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
666938 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
666939 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
666940 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
666941 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
666942 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
666943 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
666944 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
666945 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
666946 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
666947 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
666948 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
666949 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
666950 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
666951 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
666952 i am because we are a new documentary she produced about malawi orphans id kill to hear the audio from her appearance
666953 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box
666954 and we need and i need michael moore in my life
666955 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
666956 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
666957 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
666958 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country
666959 a 90 percent chance that the us has contributed 2 degrees f of temperature increase in the last 50 years
666960 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
666961 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
666962 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real
666963 first canis focaccia no cheese is italian pizza is american
666964 america is a deeply racist society and whites are to blame for all of the social problems befalling blacks
666965 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
666966 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
666967 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
666968 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
666969 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
666970 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
666971 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
666972 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
666973 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
666974 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
666975 we are borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
666976 i for one do not believe our country can withstand 10 more years of the status quo
666977 we need to change the debate in this country from what we cant do to what we can america has led every major technological shift in the last 100 years and we can lead the next one as well the problem is not technology it is political will
666978 mr gore has moved a long way from the solutions recommended in
666979 we couldnt come close to his goal of producing all our electricity from solar wind and geothermal energy in 10 years without coercive even authoritarian government
666980 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
666981 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
666982 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
666983 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
666984 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
666985 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
666986 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
666987 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
666988 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
666989 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
666990 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
666991 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
666992 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
666993 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
666994 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
666995 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
666996 we tell the enemies of god that god has saved those who will be even more painful for you
666997 as abu khabab has gone he left behind with gods grace a generation of faithful students who will make you suffer the worst torture and avenge him and his brothers
666998 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
666999 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
667000 they have to settle all their differences otherwise it will lead to a crisis in all iraqi cities
667001 it was a democratic process why did they reject it
667002 we arabs are against any new resolution that could affect our presence in this city
667003 christina applegate was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer benefiting from early detection through a doctor ordered mri the cancer is not life threatening christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
667004 im really grateful that acting is the job that was chosen for me
667005 i get really lost when im not working i dont know what im supposed to do with myself thank god for dance class and the new york times crossword puzzle and american idol but acting is what i really have to do
667006 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
667007 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
667008 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
667009 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
667010 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
667011 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
667012 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
667013 those ads really were focused on two things they were focused on the fact that sen obama wants to raise taxes and im opposed of it and he opposes an energy policy which would work including offshore drilling so the message there is therere stark differences between myself and sen obama
667014 i think we should be in a post racial environment
667015 i think sen barack obama has done an admirable job of that i dont think he has race baited i think he has been very good about that
667016 the presumptive republican nominee has embarked on a bare knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling mr obama
667017 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
667018 sitting at home in his mothers basement and ranting into the ether between games of dungeons amp dragons
667019 sen john mccain of arizona is the only republican who promises to end the george bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small angry fringe
667020 mccain is still i think upset about the op ed not being printed
667021 a lot of the maverick positioning is now turning into more conservative positioning and some of that includes not being afraid to go negative not being afraid to call a liberal a liberal and not being afraid to go after a newspaper
667022 latte drinking sushi eating volvo driving new york times reading
667023 has really become a symbol for a lot of conservative grievances
667024 for starters their editorials are decidedly liberal thats a no brainer and there are often complaints that even their general reporting is biased in subtle and not so subtle ways the new york times has come to be associated with the northeast liberal establishment
667025 yo no veo un iphone m s peque o pero como siempre prefiero esperar a que apple me sorprenda
667026 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
667027 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
667028 eine sanierung der campa ag geht nicht damit sind die anteile der eigner weg
667029 das attentat in istanbul passt nur schwer zur pkk sowohl die technik des anschlages als auch ort und zeit deuten eher auf einen islamistischen oder innert rkischen hintergrund
667030 wir wissen dass islamistische terroristen auch in der t rkei am werke sind als teil eines globalen dschihad eines weltweiten krieg gegen alle die als ungl ubige gelten
667031 you know its not about you its about your country
667032 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
667033 gee i guess we ought to drive a bit less
667034 we need more onramps and parking lots and big box stores to fuel our auto centric lifestyle and bring in more tax revenue
667035 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
667036 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
667037 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
667038 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
667039 i love colour and try not to fall into the black trap as i call it i love to feel super feminine i love dresses and skirts and dislike jeans

667042 she thought they could make a fresh start now it looks like pete has overcome his addictions
667043 the problem she always had with pete was his addiction to drugs but that looked to be in the past she never expected pete to announce he is still in love with kate
667044 the news hit her like a bombshell lisa is heartbroken and embarrassed
667045 dont mention the b word everybody asks whether im going to be next or whether im trying at the moment
667046 i hate to disappoint people but the answer is no everyone thinks that because im 34 and in a serious relationship im desperate to start a family
667047 but im not i love kids and one of the best bits about touring with the spice girls this time round was getting to know everyones babies
667048 i think people expected me to start feeling broody but i didnt and i still dont im sure at some point babies will be part of my future but i dont think theres anything wrong with feeling happy without them
667049 its great the other girls are mothers but we all have different paths in life and mine doesnt include babies right now

667056 basically the torch symbolizes hopes and aspirations of tibetan people this is being organized by all the tibet support groups around the world and then this we want to shift the spotlight at the moment when the whole media attention is at china and we want to take this as a platform to highlight the issue of tibet and to show the reality that is happening behind all these closed doors
667057 today is the seventh day six hundred hunger strikers who are participating in this campaign to represent the six million tibetan people and they are here with five demands and several appeals to the international community we are demanding immediate end to the brutal suppression of tibetans by the chinese government we also demand immediate end of dumping of liquor and other toxic wastes in tibet
667058 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
667059 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
667060 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
667061 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
667062 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer

667078 providing low interest loans could help domestic automakers survive because they now have very poor credit ratings making it more expensive for them to borrow and invest in new technologies still magliano doubts congress will offer such help if he had to guess the outcome i would bet against it he said the industry just doesnt have the political clout it used to have automakers are getting a cold shoulder because there is a feeling the industry brought on its problems itself by staying with big trucks for too long rather than moving towards more fuel efficient vehicles he said

667084 its with great pride and a lot of joy i announce today we have found proof that this hard material really is water ice and not some other substance
667085 what this tells us is we found what were looking for
667086 this tells us that weve got water ice within reach of the robotic arms which means that we can continue the investigation
667087 it was the previous evidence for ice that sent us to that location but theres a difference between expecting it and finding
667088 if they had found no ice which was a real possibility that would make this much harder
667089 im anxious to see the results of the chemical analysis
667090 we dont know the form of the water beyond the fact that there is too much there to be explained solely by water bound in minerals
667091 so chunks a layer etc are all possibilities the phoenix observation is an important advance in our understanding of water on mars and continued sampling will undoubtedly add to the story
667092 just the fact that theres ice there doesnt tell you if its habitable
667093 with ice and no food its not a habitable zone we dont eat rocks we have to have carbon chain materials that we ingest into our bodies to create new cells and give us energy thats what we eat and thats what has to be there if youre going to have a habitable zone on mars
667094 now we know for sure that we are on an icy surface and we can really meet the science goals of our mission at the highest level
667095 i am just sitting at the edge of my chair waiting to find out what the tega and meca can tell us about these soils
667096 as for the ice we were expecting to find it but science is full of the unexpected so until they actually found the ice and can begin to study it there are real questions about whether or not the hypothesis was correct
667097 the real excitement will come when they start to study the ice in detail and attempt to learn how it formed and how old it is

667100 but if the government undertakes to control and to raise wages and cannot do it if the government undertakes to care for all who may be in want and cannot do it if the government undertakes to support all unemployed workers and cannot do it if the government undertakes to lend interest free money to all borrowers and cannot do it if the state considers that its purpose is to enlighten to develop to enlarge to strengthen to spiritualize and to sanctify the soul of the people and if the government cannot do all of these things what then is it not certain that after every government failure which alas is more than probable there will be an equally inevitable revolution

667125 the way viru sehwag got those runs scoring 201 out of 329 is something that is really amazing

667155 i felt pretty crummy about 10 laps from the end because we started to wonder if wed done the right thing
667156 i must say the team did an excellent job today
667157 mike johnson did a great job with the strategy the guys did a super job in the pit stops had it run yellow for long periods we would have not had that position at the end to win is outstanding were over the moon hopefully well keep fighting for the championship in the last couple of races
667158 i knew we would be short of fuel if the race went green but when the no 57 and no 70 speedsource mazda were the only cars to come down pit lane i was worried with 5 laps to go i began apologizing to the team that i cost us a good finish but as the first car came into the pits with three laps to go i knew we had a chance we got beat by late yellows at barber after leading most of the race and this weekend we won because there wasnt a late yellow and after having only led for about a half mile it just goes to show that its never over until its over
667159 i couldnt be more proud of the stevenson motorsports team for this thrilling victory
667160 we worked very hard trying to maximize our progress with the plentiful practice time that we had on thursday afternoon the car was working nicely at the end of practice enabling us to put the no 57 pontiac gxp r up near the front on the time sheets despite the progress made the crew stayed up very late on thursday night making changes to improve the car further heading into qualifying i was confident that we had a car that was capable of starting up front we were able to place the car on the inside of the second row for the start of the race and so began one of the most exciting races that i have been a part of in quite some time
667161 mike johnson made the call during the race to bring us in during a mid race caution period for fuel it seemed like the right call but we were surprised to see that most of the front runners opted not to pit i was quite worried with about five minutes remaining because it looked like those in front were not running out of fuel however the last two laps were simply amazing finding us on the top step of the podium
667162 the celebration in the pits was out of control we were jumping up and down like mad men on the pit lane we were in complete disbelief of how the race came to us on the final straight
667163 we seem to do really well when the rolex series races outside the united states so hopefully they will add some more international races to the schedule in the future

667193 esos temas se pueden discutir pero en un ambiente distinto no es en este momento cuando la corte suprema de justicia viene haciendo su tarea como la tiene que hacer

667205 this jump in incarceration rates represents a massive intervention in american families at a time when the federal government was making claims that it was less involved in their lives
667206 these kinds of rates were not historically true 30 years ago today we are giving people custodial sentences that we wouldnt have in the past for victimless crimes our justice system has become more punitive
667207 we usually dont think of the prison system as something that is a policy shift but the public health risks and the effects on migration and fertility show that it has had fundamental consequences for all of us
667208 it is in our own self interest to be concerned and certainly from a fiscal standpoint we have an interest in times of financial difficulty we have a fixed amount of money and for every dollar we spend on incarceration we have one dollar less to spend on education and other things this is a challenging public policy question
667209 isnt it great to be living in the 21st century
667210 two years ago was a horrible election for republicans in a horrible environment the environment is now worse for republicans than it was two years ago and that means the election results could be as bad or even worse
667211 theyre a physical team theyre a big team they did a good job on the offensive boards which kept us out of the open court for a little bit
667212 but in the second half i thought we did a much better job being the initiators and playing with a bit more energy whether we scored the ball or whether we got a defensive rebound we played with more energy and pushed the ball up the floor
667213 this was a really good win for us because russia put the ball in the hands of their two best players holden and kirilenko and when they do that theyre a really good team and a tough team to defend
667214 i thought our defense was excellent and on offense we seemed a little bit out of synch
667215 what im really pleased with is it didnt come easy offensively for us and it never had a negative impact on our defense and thats a really big thing
667216 the bushite arctic freeze is thawing nationally but in texas were still iced in fight em on the ice

667218 are we playing high school with you know 5 000 nuclear warheads in our arsenal yeah we are were playing you know whos the first guy to run off the highway with us and iran
667219 one has to play according ot needs of the team not according ot his whims and fancies i would prefer a player who atleast is consistent even though he doesnt score triple hundren rather than this guy who blasts his way to triple hundred and then for the next few innings is useless identify one player in any international team who has such an attitude
667220 this decision is an insult to all police officers and is nothing more than a green light for those evil thugs who have a complete disregard for life itself and think nothing of killing a police officer
667221 granting an evil calculated killer any kind of dispensation is criminal and leaves the judiciary with blood on its hands
667222 i urge you to do whatever is needed to reverse this travesty of justice
667223 this is shockingly disrespectful to his memory and illustrates the utter travesty of our criminal justice system where the rights of a cop killer outweigh the rights of a fallen officers family friends and colleagues
667224 this heinous murderer is subject to imprisonment for the rest of his life and will be nearly 80 years old before there is any possibility of parole providing he poses no risk to the public
667225 police officers like judges serve the rule of law which protects everyone

667229 my bet is the authorities wont let them out until after the olympics
667230 not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
667231 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
667232 the chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the games
667233 it is a new low for the international community to see all these state leaders going to beijing without saying anything about the repressive environment in which the games are being held
667234 thousands of people including petitioners who have gone to beijing seeking justice from the government have been swept up in efforts to clean up the city before the games
667235 they said they were hired by the hospital and surveillance will last for the next four months it is said the olympics are approaching so they worry about us petitioners
667236 the police come to my place waiting outside and i do not know what they want to do with me
667237 because of the olympics approaching people like me nothing more than a rights defenders wife are being specially protected by the government

667271 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat

667278 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation

667339 differences in small animals are much more subtle and so are frequently over looked
667340 the great thing is that dna is as different between two small snakes as it is between two large snakes allowing us to see the differences that we cant see by eye
667341 this is unusual for snakes but seems to be a feature of small animals
667342 if a tiny snake were to have more than one offspring each egg would have to share the same space occupied by the one egg and so the two hatchlings would be half the normal size

667425 this was a difficult race we were very slow and i was struggling with the overall grip of the car i had massive oversteer and could not really push i was trying hard to keep the car on the track anyway one point is better than nothing
667426 my start wasnt perfect but okay as i had hoped i was able to overtake three cars on the first lap but later it became more difficult than expected to race with the heavy car we went for a one stop strategy so my car was almost full of fuel at the start and i also had to take care of the tyres i couldnt match the pace of the cars in front of me now we have to analyse todays lack of race pace normally this is one of our strengths
667427 looking at the weekend as a whole we have made good progress and can take a lot away from here unfortunately the race was frustrating i made it tough for myself with a poor start which dropped me down to p14 after the first couple of corners i got boxed in at turn 1 and had a lot of wheelspin out of the corner which allowed a few people to get past on the outside i was able to get past rubens on lap three which was fun but after that i quickly came up to the back of heidfeld he was very strong on the last two corners so i had no chance to overtake on the track and he was on a one stop strategy however in clean air our pace was good so this weekend is a definite step forward and i am reasonably happy with the outcome
667428 after a good start where i made up four positions on the opening lap unfortunately it wasnt a very exciting race for me we decided to start with used front and new rear tyres which proved to be a problem as the car was out of balance for the first stint then at my first pitstop we were unlucky to have the problem with the rig which resulted in a small fire and a long delay whilst we got fuel into the car using the second rig after that my race was effectively over as the number of blue flags made it impossible to make progress we decided to drop the revs on the engine and do some testing with the tyres as we had overheating problems over the weekend and it was good to collect some data on this for me the actual race was one to forget really

667487 in the last 6 olympic games there had been an average 19 12 increase in the hosting countries stock indexes in the six months following the games in the 12 month after the olympics the stock indexes had a strong 26 14 average increase
667488 these factors caused the increase on the stock market 6 months after the sporting event
667489 the infrastructure construction system establishment and environmental protection among others for the olympics gave a lasting boost to the hosting countries economy therefore although gdp growth in those hosting countries showed a certain degree of slow down generally speaking the hosting countries economy maintained a relatively high speed of growth whats more the reduction of bubbles in the post olympics capital market has typically ensured steady and benign growth history clearing indicates that the lasting winner of the beijing olympics will be the beijing economy

667525 protest by athletes doesnt really mar the games because that is something even the ioc would be opposed to
667526 but i think major protests that the chinese put down in front of television cameras particularly if they are foreign protesters that could look very bad
667527 to do something that has a big budget a great scope with a great director and great actors that has the quality and level of writing and the level of production design is a once in a lifetime opportunity

667550 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar

667553 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
667554 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
667555 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to

667561 it was devastating for my mother to lose one of her breasts and have to go through all that
667562 it is a very personal cancer for the women it affects this is about womens womanhood its one of the aspects of our femininity
667563 as crazy as that sounds to say i wish i was still with my wife
667564 there have been rumors that maybe this divorce was a ploy to protect your assets
667565 if this is a ploy her being intimate with a 19 year old kid is pretty good acting
667566 for me to be able to handle my 50 year old wife sleeping in a bed with a 19 year old boyfriend and using my gym and driving my cars and living in my house i guess weve got a pretty good act going on cause thats a lot to take on
667567 it wasnt an argument it was hey i dont love you i dont want to be with you i dont want to see you anymore it was the real deal

667577 do something soon well probably see that we dont really need to do anything really dramatic and then the window for radical social change will be closed
667578 the public thinks that this company hires anybody off the street doesnt care if theyre legal or illegal and that we know nothing about them
667579 well they got a drivers license issued by the state of rhode island and they got a social security card issued apparently by the social security administration if those things are fraudulent well thats the criminals fault not the employer
667580 other than have an immigration officer here every day i dont know what else i can do
667581 of course its not our fault it was an issue of their having to verify their payroll of employees versus their independent contractors
667582 from an industry standpoint we do see employers from time to time try to avoid having employees because it is less costly for them
667583 youll avoid paying insurance youll avoid paying payroll tax and any benefits you pass on to them
667584 management company billing agent for a number of franchisees subcontractors
667585 these individuals are more often than not husbands and wives who operate their own cleaning companies

667589 nowhere in the cleaning contract is there an indication that the cleaning is performed by independent third party contractors
667590 were caused by the failure of tristate to clean the floor in a reasonable prudent manner or to warn tenants their employees and others of the wet slippery condition of the floor adjacent to the ladies room or properly supervise its employees
667591 not the employer of any individual who may have cleaned the premises
667592 no one can force you to sign this form when you sign this form you are stating that you are an independent contractor and in the event of injury are not entitled to workers compensation
667593 pay our taxes we do everything but we cant find a job
667594 we would be employees they were going to put everyone to work that same day thats why they said show up at 5 p m
667595 is critical that employers correctly determine whether workers providing services are employees or independent contractors self employed
667596 there is no magic or set number of factors that makes the worker an employee or an independent contractor and no one factor stands alone in making this determination factors that may be relevant in one situation may not be relevant in another
667597 were absolutely delighted that hes come back into the team and scored a goal
667598 it was great for him that he was up at the end with our fans as well for his goal you can see he relates to them and they relate to him
667599 he plays with a smile on his face and we were all delighted when we saw the ball rest in the back of the net
667600 hes going to be a real plus for us this season and weve got big hopes that hes going to come back and be bigger faster and stronger
667601 we made an enquiry for the player but we couldnt reach an agreement so we move on i would suggest it is dead in the water
667602 my philosophy when youve got an interest in a player is that you know what your value of that footballer is if it cant be done it cant be done and you move on
667603 at first i wanted to stay in the premier league and i had the pen in my hand to sign
667604 then at the last minute they said that the chairman wasnt here and i had to wait so i said okay i would come back tomorrow

667615 in 1980 i signed my letter of intent with the university of oregon i chose oregon over other schools because it was the only college that would sign me as a middle linebacker while dressing down for the first practice i thought how strange it was that i was no 75
667616 after practice the coaches pulled me aside and explained that my future might be on the offensive line the dalai lama once said that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck the point im trying to make here is that nobody starts out wanting to play the offensive line position its just where we end up

667645 ive made the decision to stand down as england captain
667646 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
667647 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
667648 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
667649 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
667650 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
667651 i will take a break from the game so i wont be playing at the oval
667652 i just want to try and freshen up the mind and get back to playing as a batsman i do believe these could be the best years of my playing career
667653 thats the one thing i want to get back doing
667654 in new zealand i had a few thoughts that i might go
667655 it is a fairytale to captain your country but it hasnt had a fairytale ending i know that it is the right time because my mind told me it was my body is working well but my mind is not
667656 i wish whoever gets the job all the luck in the world its a great privilege
667657 michael led from the front and led with honesty and integrity every step of the way
667658 he took the england captaincy to new heights michael was the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the character he instilled in the dressing room
667659 paul feels this is the best decision in terms of benefiting the england team and his contribution to the team
667660 we are extremely grateful for way paul led the one day side since last year
667661 the selection committee is currently considering the squad and captain for the fourth test and natwest series these squads along with the captain will be announced tomorrow monday
667662 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket
667663 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game
667664 i feel the england captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team
667665 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
667666 the last thing i want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the team which is why ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration
667667 i will continue to make myself available to england for all forms of cricket and look forward to playing a significant role in englands future success
667668 i am really proud of the way we played in this test match
667669 the first test was one of those games where nothing went right for us but the way we have come back after four days its really amazing
667670 i am really proud of the fact that i have this group of players who have shown so much resilience not just once but time and time again
667671 the way viru sehwag got those runs scoring 201 out of 329 is something that is really amazing
667672 and also taking that forward to the second innings is never easy it was brilliant batting our opening partnerships in both innings were very important for us
667673 for a 19 year old to crank it up like he sharma did was something special
667674 i thought chasing 307 on a fourth day pitch was a good score to chase but its important you get a good start in any run chase
667675 we didnt get that and being 10 for three was obviously not ideal were very disappointed with those last two sessions
667676 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate because hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
667677 michael vaughans decision is his own decision but i cant believe that paul collingwood made that decision off his own back
667678 clearly they want to unite the job and get one bloke in there and theyve given paul a gentle nudge to say that this is in the best interests of the team
667679 hes been a wonderfully successful captain englands most successful in terms of test match wins and is surely one of englands greatest ever captains
667680 in terms of playing captaining leading decision making michael vaughan is the best man for the job
667681 its a wonderful job but its also a job that becomes all consuming he said hes not been himself at home and wanted to get back to being me
667682 the job gets on top of you its a great job but youre thinking about it all the time
667683 when youre supposed to be at dinner with friends or the wife youre thinking about who should be opening the bowling the next day and how to tell your mate hes not in the next team
667684 that pressure eventually bears down on you and if youre not getting runs as well then it becomes very difficult

667698 hes our quarterback and hes the guy not only the offense looks to but the entire team
667699 you have to understand the position that the program is in and position youre in

667702 its about what you do for your team and how you prepare week in and week out that kind of got me through things

667720 finally i was at a loss to explain how this box improves upon the time warner dvr he already has except for tivotogo and a number of minor features that allow him to pull video off of the tivo for later use which is really all he wanted to do all i could recommend was getting the humax dvd burning tivo not a rousing advertisement for the dt sure it has an ethernet port and sure the little wireless adapter they sent us to play with is cool looking but i cant recommend this as an upgrade for current tivo users nor can i recommend this to a first time tivo user the analog rf cable tuner is just not useful enough to consider this an upgrade tivo users are a long suffering and patient lot they accept buggy annoying installs and land line dial up setups they play with tv inputs so they can record one show and watch another at the same time they change cable channels so they can watch hd content and record it at the same time they work around tivos many limitations and still stand by the product like a battered hillbilly yelling at the police on cops to leave her man be he wouldnt hurt nobody give us series 3 or give us death for many far too many in fact the cable companys hd ready dvr is getting more and more tempting and that is a sad sad fact

667729 breezed through the most quiet and efficient airport ive ever seen how is this possible
667730 masked people wandering aimlessly around the airport presumably in search of some germs and a virus airport cops trundle along like toy soldiers in packs of no less than 3 for some reason in their perfect white gloves and oversized 1970s action man suits the guns seem awkward on their hips almost comical
667731 gulliver has arrived in tokyo exhausted confused but here at last

667742 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
667743 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
667744 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive

667817 as other discovered texts proved the hittite pantheon was in fact borrowed from or through the hurrians
667818 mitra ash uruwana indra and the nashatiyanu gods the very mithra varuna indra and the nasatya gods of the hindu pantheon
667819 zoroaster 628 551 bc was probably a priest of the old aryan religion for he calls himself a zaotar indian hotar in the gatas yasna 33 6 he also retained the old poetic form for the meter of his gathas is similar to that of the vedas he further exalted the concept of asha truth the rta of india and further used words in the same sense as in the vedas
667820 the deity is like a partner in discourse with the prophet and this is new with zoroaster
667821 the adherents of the old aryan religion were more rites centered and the adherents of zoroaster perhaps to be designated as aryan reformers more belief centered
667822 the ethics taught by zarathustra were based on the social life of the husbandman the good man is one who looks after the cattle and tills the soil in peace and neighborliness he is upright and has a burning regard for the truth it is his duty to keep away from those who worship the daevas and to resist them with force if necessary angra mainyu the great evil spirit threatens the farmers life
667823 zarathustra zoroaster was the son of a priest of a pastoral tribe
667824 the god whom he addressed as ahura mazda had attributes both ethical and celestial of the sky god varuna a focal figure of vedic religion but the indigenous religion of early iran entertained belief in a host of other gods and spirits mithra vayu yima the fravashi and so on zarathustra equated the gods with evil spirits who seduced men from the true worship of the one spirit he often mentioned druj the lie which was an evil force waging a struggle against ahura mazda the chief evil spirit in the service of druj was angra mainyu

667827 levi and brian do free running and parkour and they did great these must be good ways to train
667828 oh they are just good atheletes and were training before that
667829 even when it seems all hope is gone carry on
667830 now i know everything are you ready for me world
667831 lower susceptibility to the problem of conceptual condensation extreme depth of subject matter knowledge that makes it difficult to see subjects from the students perspective
667832 often translates into difficulty for the young teacher to gain respect from the students
667833 most law professors at elite schools anyway come into teaching with only a few years of practice experience
667834 being bottom man on a deal or litigation team doesnt translate into meaningful knowledge
667835 if you come to copenhagen i will show you a christmas snow a real christmas snow the snow that fell between 1 b c and 1 a d
667836 i can also show you a sample of the very last snow that fell right at the end of the last ice age which was 11 700 years ago
667837 how would you like to see the air samples that contain the sulfuric traces of the mount vesuvius volcanic eruption
667838 that s impossible i ve got to see this for myself
667839 shes a very tough opponent she proved that this week
667840 she beat some very good players but its another match i just want to focus on myself playing my game being aggressive and lets see whos going to be stronger sunday
667841 we crawled to the border that was our solution and i think we stayed at the border for two or three hours until the army let the injured enter
667842 i used to go up there 30 years ago and then my boys went up there when they were teens
667843 now you wonder if the memories are so bad that anyone will go out there anymore
667844 im sad this incident happened because it interrupted a beautiful and loving party im happy none of my people or friends got hurt and the party continues

667847 we wanted to know whether a drug specific for ppar delta would have the same beneficial effects
667848 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise
667849 we knew what gordons strengths were when people like me nominated him and supported him and it was his profound understanding of what this country needs
667850 anything that gets in the way of all of us as a team putting that message across effectively is a distraction from what needs to be done and is in danger of letting david cameron win by default
667851 we desperately need to find a way out of this mess and to end the personal dog fighting and to help restore some dignity to the standing of the labour party and our government

667853 i suppose its like playing the nab cup for the next four weeks and then heading into round one
667854 the positive is that we are going down with a few young kids and are learning in the process
667855 at the moment we are not good enough against the better teams in the competition
667856 at the moment we are probably just not good enough to play against geelong and collingwood and the bulldogs
667857 but i think you have to be realistic about where you are at
667858 theres no point stumbling into the top four and unless we start winning games of footy we are not going to be there anyway
667859 all that does now is put us four games clear of fourth with four games left
667860 its proof what will happen if you give too much possession away they took their opportunities and they scored some good points it was a real learning curve for us out there
667861 you win three games and everyone is talking you up as top eight top seven top six
667862 i thought canberra was tremendous actually but defensively we dismantled them
667863 they kept throwing plenty at us but our defence was tremendous i think there is a long way to go for our attack yet but what we do know is the chemistry is there it is just a matter of getting the right mix now
667864 we have enough strike power across the ground with justin back to get to the try line
667865 if we get the things right that we need to get right over the next five weeks you get closer to where you want to be and give yourself a chance of beating somebody that is good
667866 i think everyone is over the whole thing i certainly am
667867 we need to move on as a club and i dont think the players today were thinking i wish sonny bill was here
667868 we prepared as well as we could and i thought the atmosphere was ok pre game in the dressing room
667869 but we just went out and fell into the same traps weve done the last couple of weeks and conceded 30 points in the first half youre on a hiding to nothing there
667870 morales down and theres a lot of blokes who have been in this club since sonny was 16 so its not just about losing a great footballer
667871 ive said to some of them its ok to feel a little upset you could be sad you could be missing him so let them all come out and well deal with it
667872 some blokes are really angry some blokes are really frustrated it will mean different things to different people
667873 a lot of blokes looked up to him particularly the younger guys and they probably felt hes let them down and its a bit hard for them to get on with it now theres no doubt thats an influence and when you take your marquee player out of your team its going to hurt you
667874 its a difficult time for the club its a difficult time for me personally and for all the players and fans its difficult
667875 theres no radical cure for it we know we just need to keep punching theres no answer in the short term
667876 i think at the end of this your club comes out much stronger i dont think theres any quick way out but you find out a fair bit about the players on your roster when things like this do happen
667877 you find how much theyre willing to fight and how hard theyre willing to fight to get out of something like this
667878 when i got off the plane in switzerland last monday and my knee was swollen id say my chance of competing at the olympics were 0 1 out of 10
667879 now i give myself a six out of 10 chance maybe seven
667880 absolutely i give myself a chance of riding at the olympics its feeling better all the time but i want to get it to eight out of 10
667881 i want to do what is the best thing by the team
667882 were hoping he will be in the road race and certainly hell be competing in the time trial
667883 ive had a little too much drama over the past two weeks
667884 what happened at the function was that the floor was wet and i slipped
667885 it was an accumulation of fatigue and sitting on a bike for three weeks which from a posterial and physical point of view is not good for your body
667886 my orthopaedic surgeon told me people have done a lot worse injuries by slipping in their own baths
667887 national coach shayne bannan called me with the time trial news and i was on the table getting treatment with my knee all bandaged up in ice and an electro stimulator attached
667888 he said weve got that second place i looked at my swollen knee and thought oh good for you
667889 every day im doing the physio and treatment on my knee and every day its getting better but well decide on monday morning whether i go or adam hansen goes in my place
667890 for me to go and start the time trial id have to have a pretty stellar ride in the road race
667891 i dont want to go unless i can do a good result for myself and the team or contribute to a good result for the team
667892 so if i dont recover from my injury and am not close to my best i dont mind staying at home
667893 treatment on cadels knee has been going well and were hopeful that on monday hell get the all clear to fly to beijing
667894 its a really tough time being at the club and playing football is your life and it is hard when you have it all taken away from you
667895 its like your world gets turned upside down you go from it being your life to not being able to train or be part of the team its a spin out
667896 hes a great player and it would be great to get him back for the semis everyone knows how good he is but in the end it is up to the club it is their decision
667897 of course it would be good to have him back but thats not our decision its up to the club
667898 herbie marc herbert has come in and done the job so far it isnt tough for me because herbie and i have played a lot of football together in the lower grades
667899 we know each other well so thats not a big issue
667900 you have to get something out of the first game whether its a win or a draw because that keeps you in the rest of the tournament
667901 in 2004 we got through to the quarter finals on goal difference i dont care how we get through but id say youll need four points
667902 were striving for nine points were here to be confident every games a new game for us and we want to win every game
667903 were physically prepared for the conditions were nearly tactically ready and the fact weve played in asia over the last two years our players know exactly what were in for
667904 we want to see how argentina perform in these conditions which hopefully will be in our advantage
667905 i promised my fans back in australia that i would win by knockout and i delivered on the promise
667906 i dont want to just become undisputed champion i dont want to stay too long in this weight division i want to fight for other belts
667907 im 32 i want to move because i can feel big power
667908 i can fight any opponent taller than me and i feel powerful and every day the power is getting more and more
667909 i was very focused for the fight what the fans saw today was a stronger smarter and very focused fighter
667910 i sparred and trained with russians i knew their style
667911 his performance today reminded me very much of how kostya tszyu stopped zab judah inside two rounds in las vegas seven years ago
667912 if i was one of the fight judges i would have rated vics performance as a perfect 10
667913 whore drunk people should realize im not amused but they dont cause theyre drunk this is also unfortunate though honestly as the sole sober member of the outing there wasnt a whole lot i could do about it as i walked up and down 57
667914 why cant my girlfriend of the week be more like you
667915 i want to find a girl just like you but not you
667916 and were just one mistake one bad moment from being a dawsons creek episode
667917 people that came were also different back then you see some interesting people come see the fest this time none

667932 wed tried pepsi and virgin cola and various others too
667933 but they werent really a positive alternative they were acceptable but they werent coke and people really want coke
667934 given that most of the cubes customers come because they like the places diy attitude
667935 one way of doing that was to make the cola ourselves
667936 the caramel had to be sourced direct from dd williamson a large operation based in manchester which actually provides the caramel for all the coca cola manufactured in the uk and the caffeine we found at
667937 unfortunately none of us had any scientific knowledge whatsoever and its quite a scientific process
667938 we spent half our time running out to get ingredients that we didnt have and we kept having to go round to the local post office to weigh things on their parcel scales
667939 we managed to destroy a whole series of kitchen mixers completely trashed them the gum arabic scoured the sides the blades snapped it was really violent and very distressing
667940 wed bought ours from the local indian food shop but it wasnt particularly homogenous so each time it was giving us different results
667941 do hope that along the way well help produce a small reality shift its social change through science and baking sort of diy aesthetic meets the wi
667942 as the saying goes imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
667943 but our product is unique anyone with a selection of ingredients could make a type of cola but there can only be one coke
667944 1 walk in the door the hardest part no matter how tired make 2 or 3 days a week mandatory in the gym when doesnt matter just do it before you get home in the evening gotta start with commitment 2 warm up 5 to 10 minutes on the elliptical or bike 3 do less forget about 3 sets one set of 10 to 20 with enough weight to tire the muscle not to the point of pain or strain this yields 90 of the benefit of 3 sets in 1 5 of the time less boring too 4 limit yourself to 6 to 9 machines and 20 to 30 minutes 5 rotate among upper body core mid section and legs keep moving no rests 6 work major muscle groups curls not needed arms are worked indirectly by chest back or shoulder exercises 7 the slower you move weight the better if you rush youre not working the muscle over its full range 8 hop on the elliptical for 10 to 20 minutes and optionally switch to the treadmill for another 5 to 10 work hard enough to sweat no reading allowed once youve settled into a routine intersperse with 1 or 2 minute intense intervals interval training where you push your heart rate an extra 10 or 20 bpm cool down for a few minutes stretch at the end of the workout 9 reward yourself with a few minutes in the steam room or sauna 10 go home and eat mostly veggies with some fruit and protein protein portion only a deck of cards needed skip the health really candy bars and protein drinks 11 on days you skip the gym do something even if just a 10 minute walk or two

667956 we heard chrome amp throbbing gristle amp thought they were pop bands so maybe that gives you some idea of what im gettin at
667957 you always have to believe in yourself and your ability to do whatever it takes i think i can win a medal but obviously it is going to be very tough just to get into the final first
667958 my goal is definitely to make the final and i will be going into that final wanting to win to give it everything i have
667959 i think i am still a pain to coach at most times i am always pretty grumpy
667960 it is a really hard time at the moment because we both want it to be perfect and when it is not you are always asking why am i doing this or that wrong
667961 we are both on edge at the moment because there is only a couple of weeks to go when i am at training and do something wrong i just snap really quickly because you want it to all go perfect at every training session if it doesnt work that is why i get angry you want the best all the time
667962 i dont feel pressured in any way i am just focusing on what i have to do to get there
667963 i have just been eating more healthy focusing on it more this year than in the past it is an olympic year so you have to be in your best form ever
667964 i told them i wasnt interested now but maybe later its a very interesting situation over in france at the moment
667965 it will be interesting to see how sonny bill goes
667966 i think he will make it but im not sure what position he will play
667967 you knew to a point what they were going to do
667968 we started really well last week and our confidence grew as robbie deans said it was probably a mirror of last saturdays game we were in it the boys didnt put their heads down but it was just that accumulation of pressure
667969 they had a lot to play for the last game at eden park before it is reconstructed for the 2011 world cup and obviously not being embarrassed again they stood up and did really well
667970 we just had to get down there and the thing is we couldnt get down there they didnt allow us
667971 the only set plays we had at that point we scored points off we scored that penalty matt giteau and then we scored that try adam ashley cooper
667972 it was frustrating in the sense that we couldnt get down there but they didnt let us
667973 we have beaten them already but they are a 10 to 15 point better team over there
667974 we got shown up in auckland and that wont happen again we have to play harder than we did in perth when we beat them we have to try and take the crowd out of it first and foremost they really get off on the crowd and how much they pump them up
667975 earlier on in the week i asked the boys for a special effort for me today and they came through they really did come through
667976 sometimes these things go the reverse of what you want them to so i was just hoping the player group would be focused
667977 i didnt want them to go over the top they were cool calm and collected and in the first quarter pav matthew pavlich and luke mcpharlin just unloaded with three goals each and made my day a lot easier
667978 milestones and last games i havent got the stats on them but they can certainly go either way because of the fact youve got a lot of things to lose and the opposition prey on it
667979 its a day the fremantle football club will never forget its very important you send off your players in the right manner and we did that today
667980 it meant the world to me to be able to say goodbye to the fans
667981 they have been terrific they supported me through thick and thin
667982 probably retire it for life i would have thought or a week
667983 i was one of the people that when he hurt his knee for the second time thought that was going to curtail his career
667984 to see him out there today is an amazing effort of what hes done and how hes gone about it
667985 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
667986 and one of the challenges moving forward is to expand and bring in more talent people from other campaigns and other places and still maintain that culture we began with i think its happening but its a process and it fights the normal physics of national politics
667987 specifically sought out people who are going to play by those rules
667988 no estamos preocupados por la seguridad de qantas ni hemos encontrado pruebas de fallos en la seguridad de sus revisiones pero han tenido lugar un par de incidentes recientemente y es importante de que nos aseguremos de que todo funcione correctamente
667989 if you notice there are a lot of similarities in our affidavits but in major issues we differ so its up to the people to decide who is telling the truth
667990 at that point i was shocked that he had a very low regard for me he was treating me like there was a price on my person i could not describe my feelings i was stunned but at the same time hindi ko rin magawang bastusin siya i could not afford to be rude to him because i had known him since 1993 and this was the first time that he had ever treated me like this or shown that he believed i could be bought
667991 we are studying the possibility of charging him of attempted bribery perjury for lying and libel
667992 i want to protect him i thought he was a friend kaya nga di ko binanggit pangalan niya kasi kawawa naman siya thats why i didnt mention his name because i pitied him but he violated my person so i have to come out he made it difficult for me
667993 pero ngayon but now after what he has done i have to protect my name because it does not only involve my integrity as a justice but the integrity of my family
667994 i did not ask for that money nor was there any agreement between us that he would give the same as a matter of fact mr de borja offered that money after the conclusion of the deal and without me having to ask or saying anything when i agreed to advice there was absolutely no expectation of receiving i did not violate any law you can check all the statute books on that
667995 he was still a sitting judge in the rtc he had no business advising on legal disputes
667996 judges shall ensure that not only is their conduct above reproach but that it is perceived to be so in the view of a reasonable observer
667997 if you will insist on assuming the chairmanship after you have been told of the p10m offer what will i think of you now why should meralco insist on you assuming the chairmanship and have me ousted
667998 is it because they are certain of your loyalty and they are uncertain with mine
667999 can you blame me now if i will think that you are a part of this whole scheme or shenanigan
668000 does not the timing alone stink of corruption after they failed to convince me of their offer now they will use you to oust me
668001 why did they meralco actively participate in the hearing on the 23rd and never raised any question regarding the supposed irregularity of my presiding over the hearing
668002 why do you insist on assuming the case are you not aware that several days after the issuance of the tro respondents gsis filed a motion for inhibition and motion to lift the tro who then has the right to resolve such motions
668003 under the circumstances do you expect me to give way to you
668004 i am afraid that they will file a case of non feasance against me
668005 integrity is essential not only to the proper discharge of judicial office but also the personal demeanor of judges
668006 judges shall ensure that not only is their conduct above reproach but that it is perceived to be so in the view of a reasonable observer
668007 in the judiciary moral integrity is more than a cardinal virtue it is a necessity

668093 for me to play at real madrid is a dream and if this agreement is eventually sealed i will be a happy man
668094 it was a very good club who are waiting for me
668095 for the moment im still a hamburg player but i hope things can be settled soon and that the two clubs can find an agreement
668096 for us its just a fact we have to face that we are not reaching the same level as we did do even in the early part of last season we have to get our performance up we have to get our standards up and play very quickly in the first half hour of the game against kaunas on wednesday we were not up there but after that we were ok weve got a bit to do to pick up on and we need to do it quickly
668097 there was a balance to be achieved there in the sense of bringing an edge to our game for the champions league games
668098 but if you look at the result we would probably have been better not having a game it was a friendly so i dont think morale for tuesday will be a problem the basic problem we have is getting back to the level that will allow us to compete in a better manner
668099 weve got to wait to see what will happen in the transfer market with regard to signing a new striker but what wayne did last season was staggering

668110 ive spoken to celtic about jim obrien and i await their answer to my proposal
668111 i think he has really got a lot of work to do however the way we play and the system we play would accommodate and suit him which would be a value to us
668112 i think if he signs were going to have to work very hard with jim and hes going to have to work very hard with us
668113 in saying that he has got great energy hes as fit as anybody which allows him to run all day over and above that hes got pace and has a trick or two in his locker
668114 it will be our job if he signs to get it all under control and get the very best from him if we can do that then i think weve got the potential to acquire a very decent player
668115 weve got to decide on whether or not we can accommodate another midfield player it may prove a luxury that our finances cant stretch too but we certainly like maman
668116 seyfo soley didnt play in our last friendly against preston because this was our last game and we felt it vital that our back four and goalkeeper got a full 90 minutes

668118 well osama is still on this side of the dirt so yeah hubs is prolly going back

668209 we welcome the opportunity to provide software and services to becta as we have in the commercial sector but we are yet to see how becta intends to make a viable climate for both paid for and free software providers
668210 we hope an open source company is included in the final list because it will benefit both the open source community and children
668211 becta is seeing the light but as an organisation that is supposedly a technology innovator it should have moved into open source three or four years ago

668213 he looked good and it was good to get him back out there
668214 he had an mri and the mri said he was ready to go i look forward to seeing him with the pads on today
668215 this is a big year for me personally and we have a great team
668216 i just feel like this is the year for me to establish myself as one of the elite tight ends which i feel like i am and i think my coaches feel like i am i just feel like the sky is the limit for me if i stay healthy
668217 i didnt need a rest and now im just trying to work my way back into things
668218 i feel good enough to come out here and practice i want to get my rhythm and establish a good relationship with donovan mcnabb i didnt play any preseason last year so i want to come out here and have a good preseason last year was a wasted year for me i was in and out training room missing games and i wasnt healthy until three quarters of the season and then i missed the last few games of the season everybody should take a vacation and get away but for me it was work
668219 everybody around me was saying that every year they have one person they slap the franchise tag on and they chose you i should feel positive and feel appreciative about that
668220 wed tried pepsi and virgin cola and various others too
668221 but they werent really a positive alternative they were acceptable but they werent coke and people really want coke
668222 given that most of the cubes customers come because they like the places diy attitude
668223 one way of doing that was to make the cola ourselves
668224 the caramel had to be sourced direct from dd williamson a large operation based in manchester which actually provides the caramel for all the coca cola manufactured in the uk and the caffeine we found at
668225 unfortunately none of us had any scientific knowledge whatsoever and its quite a scientific process
668226 we spent half our time running out to get ingredients that we didnt have and we kept having to go round to the local post office to weigh things on their parcel scales
668227 we managed to destroy a whole series of kitchen mixers completely trashed them the gum arabic scoured the sides the blades snapped it was really violent and very distressing
668228 wed bought ours from the local indian food shop but it wasnt particularly homogenous so each time it was giving us different results
668229 do hope that along the way well help produce a small reality shift its social change through science and baking sort of diy aesthetic meets the wi
668230 as the saying goes imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
668231 but our product is unique anyone with a selection of ingredients could make a type of cola but there can only be one coke
668232 but i feel for those guys because i know how hard it is to go through those things to bust your butt in the off season and then to get injured in training camp i know how it is
668233 he looks strong and fast and quick i think hes playing very good right now we want him to maintain that and hes going against the first team offense its a good gauge of what hes all about right now and it looks like hes doing ok
668234 its just a lot of hard work finally paying off for me
668235 hes back healthy and thats just exciting to see that because hes been through so much

668238 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice
668239 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
668240 because i know what to do with gods fame with gods visibility with gods influence to jesus be the glory
668241 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
668242 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
668243 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
668244 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
668245 in my youth i watched every game i could i studied all the great players lambert ham bobby bell and many others
668246 its tough we hit every single play if we get up at 6 oclock in the morning were hitting at 7 you have to be a man about it
668247 we get together in the huddle and just say lets go
668248 coaches get comfortable with the guy thats there they get used to what hes good at
668249 you dont just have another guy show up and throw him in there and expect him to pick up where he left off thats why were out here for a month before the season starts
668250 i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
668251 this morning everyone got up and youve never seen so many grown men so excited
668252 it was like they were 10 years old and it was christmas
668253 we didnt try to cram something in there when we werent prepared and they werent prepared
668254 i would have definitely been part of the conspiracy if someone would have done that
668255 i thought it was good that they could all feel like they were 30 plus today
668256 both are highly contagious things so weve put him in a separate room and just kind of kept him away from everything
668257 i want to get him back in but i want to make sure hes healthy at the same time
668258 im anxious to get him back in there and going
668259 well just have to see how this rehab goes and how hes doing
668260 were able to work on some specific areas of the game and really focus in and slow it down and teach them and at the same time get some good film on it so we can use that also as a teaching tool
668261 its like your regular defense but just with a lot of safeties in there you have to make sure everythings straight
668262 i feel that if i bat janish second hell see some good pitches to hit with griffey batting behind him
668263 groupo calle 8 and currently touring the u s performing live shows in new jersey miami washington and virginia clubs
668264 i had to give the cornel jerry some face time today ugg i cant stand that man i am sorry
668265 he was pitching really really well until the sixth inning his pitch count was down at 75 pitches then it just started piling up on him
668266 i just want to be able to keep us in games
668267 te puse donde hab a y no lo tomaste idiota
668268 a new phase of life thats emerging between the end of midlife career and real old age
668269 like working retired thats kind of like walking dead nothing aspirational about it encore career is a radically optimistic notion you wont make more money or become more famous but you might be doing the most essential work of your life with heart and soul
668270 life skills compassion are as important as a pile of letters after your name
668271 the bridge from midlife careers to encore careers remains almost invisible to many
668272 i dont know what ive done here and i didnt know about kendrick
668273 everybody else knows the numbers but i dont worry about them
668274 who said im not enjoying it i enjoy baseball and whatever comes good or bad i enjoy the game ive done a lot of good things a few bad things
668275 people dont understand that this is the era where hype is everything
668276 ive seen hank aaron willie mays sammy sosa and junior
668277 and i saw jay bruces first one and hey who knows
668278 i tell him he sounds just like my damn dad same age same stories they had to walk to school 12 miles uphill both ways
668279 is sometimes embarrassing because i never believed this would happen my dad was who i wanted to be like and i thought if i had a career like him that would be great
668280 i mean here was a guy who looked like me acted like me laughed like me and took care of me
668281 i never thought id be better than him even though he told me i would when i was 14 sometimes dad does know best even when you dont want to listen when youre 14
668282 i worry about what i need to do today and let tomorrow take care of itself i havent discussed that im still having fun and as long as youre having fun you still want to play im playing and still teaching the young guys how to play
668283 all ive been taught is dont embarrass your organization your teammates or your family
668284 we need some pitching help bad so we couldnt wait we put fogg on the dl and called up majewski
668285 well come up with somethng we have a few days before we have to come up with something there are a couple of guys lined up
668286 be quiet man every time i look in the paper its like oh my god thats why we have to get our pitching together
668287 score early play hard play defense close out games you are supposed to close out dont let it get into your head ive seen it get into some teams heads and the law of averages are on our side
668288 ill tell you who is fast becoming a good ballplayer is that johnson kid for atlanta second baseman kelly johnson
668289 all i know is i see him running around the bases a lot

668308 es wurde deutlich dass die fraktion der npd gut vorbereitet in die sitzungen geht die gesch ftsordnung kennt und sie anzuwenden wei
668309 die sachbeitr ge bleiben in den meisten f llen oberfl chlich und auch in den aussch ssen in denen die mandatstr ger der npd sich nur vereinzelt zu wort melden wird ihre mangelnde kompetenz in sachfragen offenbar
668310 sie strebt danach mit legalen mitteln durch wahlen und vor allem durch ihre politische basisarbeit in den kommunen ihre rechtsextreme ideologie mit dem ziel zu verbreiten dass diese zur normalit t in den k pfen wird um letztendlich das system zu berwinden

668316 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain i panicked when a pakistani high altitude carrier fell straight onto my back with his entire weight
668317 i was terrified that he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
668318 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people
668319 that two weeks has got to be looked at from the point of view that they did take a four or five day break to go and consult

668321 why do you have to buy the 3000 dslr when you can spend 600 or the others eos 40d 1300

668323 we fear that change will be much harder and longer than many might believe
668324 the dysfunction at dhs goes deep down to the bone
668325 this failure is appalling on many levels not least because ms walkers job was to supervise five employees to make sure that they completed their investigations
668326 if she did not do this what on earth was she being paid for
668327 workers like poindexter to continuously ignore reports of children being abused and neglected
668328 instead of supporting supervisors who tried to hold poindexter accountable ms poller covered up for him for his lax supervisor janice walker and for herself
668329 we heard from the dhs workforce find ways to get rid of the bad workers because it brings us all down
668330 and wed wait until the grand jury finished its work
668331 expectations need to be made clear to the workers and im very very focused on accountability
668332 some people are going to have to go as we move forward
668333 im prepared to make those decisions and its clear from the report that other people who sat in my seat were not

668339 fans of both hard and softer psychological sf will welcome veteran niven and newcome coopers well written tale of a 60 000 year layover in space in which physical challenges of world building are matched by the social challenges of collaboration among disparate groups
668340 i am really proud of the way we played in this test match
668341 the first test was one of those games where nothing went right for us but the way we have come back after four days its really amazing
668342 i am really proud of the fact that i have this group of players who have shown so much resilience not just once but time and time again
668343 the way viru sehwag got those runs scoring 201 out of 329 is something that is really amazing
668344 and also taking that forward to the second innings is never easy it was brilliant batting our opening partnerships in both innings were very important for us
668345 for a 19 year old to crank it up like he sharma did was something special
668346 i thought chasing 307 on a fourth day pitch was a good score to chase but its important you get a good start in any run chase
668347 we didnt get that and being 10 for three was obviously not ideal were very disappointed with those last two sessions

668392 this is a devastating blow to everyone who has enjoyed seeing these beautiful creatures we know that bottlenose dolphins are in danger of disappearing from cornish waters as gradually one by one their numbers are dwindling
668393 we know the animals are reproducing so its particularly worrying that their numbers are in decline
668394 i was thrilled when i turned over that rock and found it
668395 after finding the first one we turned hundreds of other stones to find another one
668396 differences in small animals are much more subtle and so are frequently over looked
668397 the great thing is that dna is as different between two small snakes as it is between two large snakes allowing us to see the differences that we cant see by eye
668398 this is unusual for snakes but seems to be a feature of small animals
668399 if a tiny snake were to have more than one offspring each egg would have to share the same space occupied by the one egg and so the two hatchlings would be half the normal size
668400 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
668401 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body
668402 but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
668403 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
668404 it was under a rock we got two of them

668548 all those who stood against iran over the past years have now reached a conviction that in this issue there is no other way but to involve into dialogue and consultation
668549 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks and planting doubts about people
668550 what we have got to do is make sure that we are very clear to the american people about how my policies will make a difference in their lives
668551 i think its important to be honest that youre pregnant im not ashamed of it but its made finding a job very difficult were young and we need a double income to have the baby pay off the mortgage and bills it all adds up
668552 i think some employers are insensitive i dont think they have any understanding of pregnant employees they need guidelines
668553 small businesses have trouble just trying to cope with someone being off on maternity leave hiring someone who is pregnant brings additional complications for them
668554 they look for who can do the job now if the person is leaving on maternity leave in a couple of months and somebody else is there rather than starting all over again they might say this new person has some advantages
668555 even with qualifications behind you businesses get nervous that youre going to leave them when i would actually feel very grateful and would want to return to wnewswwork part time after the babys born one business said they had too many pregnant women working there already
668556 basically the torch symbolizes hopes and aspirations of tibetan people this is being organized by all the tibet support groups around the world and then this we want to shift the spotlight at the moment when the whole media attention is at china and we want to take this as a platform to highlight the issue of tibet and to show the reality that is happening behind all these closed doors
668557 today is the seventh day six hundred hunger strikers who are participating in this campaign to represent the six million tibetan people and they are here with five demands and several appeals to the international community we are demanding immediate end to the brutal suppression of tibetans by the chinese government we also demand immediate end of dumping of liquor and other toxic wastes in tibet
668558 dont mention the b word everybody asks whether im going to be next or whether im trying at the moment
668559 i hate to disappoint people but the answer is no everyone thinks that because im 34 and in a serious relationship im desperate to start a family
668560 but im not i love kids and one of the best bits about touring with the spice girls this time round was getting to know everyones babies
668561 i think people expected me to start feeling broody but i didnt and i still dont im sure at some point babies will be part of my future but i dont think theres anything wrong with feeling happy without them
668562 its great the other girls are mothers but we all have different paths in life and mine doesnt include babies right now
668563 and while im being so honest id better say my current plans dont include marriage either maybe one day but right now neither of us is in any rush to change things
668564 she has had a really hard time of late she thought they had rekindled their love for each other
668565 they have a child together and have always been close
668566 she thought they could make a fresh start now it looks like pete has overcome his addictions
668567 the problem she always had with pete was his addiction to drugs but that looked to be in the past she never expected pete to announce he is still in love with kate
668568 the news hit her like a bombshell lisa is heartbroken and embarrassed
668569 i havent shacked up with anyone since when you split up with someone youre seriously in love with it takes a lot of time before you even realise you are upset you know it just hits you
668570 we are facing lot of problems due to the curfew there is no conveyance available for us to go back the government has done no arrangements for us
668571 we had taken nine vehicles full of people and when we were just a few kilometers away from katra some people attacked us and asked us to go away as they were planning protests even though curfew was clamped in the city we came back with great difficulty after saving our lives
668572 this phenomenon has not been really taken into account yet and we need to explore and understand it
668573 this leaves the company with no alternative but to dismiss you
668574 it is really stressful and has made me ill i have worked all my life i have not claimed a penny off the state and paid all my taxes i have worked and worked and worked i am extremely frustrated and annoyed how could anyone question if i am british or not
668575 it is like assisted evolution if you gave evolution long enough we would adapt to have smaller stomachs and bowels this just produces it more quickly
668576 this is a procedure that can transform lives it can cure diabetes people may say it is an expensive operation but in reality it is cheap because it pays for itself in three years through reduction in illness

668584 israels treatment of palestinians has traditionally angered some in jordan
668585 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
668586 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
668587 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
668588 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
668589 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two
668590 democrats crack me up george bush will go down in history as one of our best presidents
668591 would you have had a chance at even getting into annapolis doubt it
668592 do the american people want to elect the worlds biggest celebrity or do they want to elect an american hero somebody who is a leader somebody who has the right ideas to deal in a serious way with the problems we face
668593 i wanted to take an opportunity to bring you up to speed on the latest phase of the campaign weve entered in to
668594 the point we are making if it hasnt escaped anybody is that you know these images of celebrity status and the way he has conducted his campaign to date both in the kinds of events that he has and what he says at these events owe more to the development of an international celebrity status than it does to a traditional campaign for president
668595 we believe the distinction that is made in this ad is a man who clearly has got fans all around the world owing to the unique aspect of his trip to europe where he held the first ever political rally abroad with his fans in germany
668596 we wanted to give you the opportunity to show how we feel about it and answer whatever questions you might have i think people and maybe certain polling trends indicate this are beginning to make a distinction between the popularity that surrounds barack obama as a celebrity and the kinds of events that he puts on with his adoring fans and there is a distinction i think in the american publics mind between that and actually having a political movement based on ideas and solutions senator mccain is prepared to lead this country and tackle the hard issues he talks about them every day in town halls he answers questions he puts out policy initiatives and he is engaged in the debate in front of the american people we think that is a significantly different kind of debate than is going on with our opponent
668597 i would say that is it beyond dispute that he has become the biggest celebrity in the world
668598 when you look at this election in terms of the economic crisis we are in senator obama has a track record of voting to raise taxes on people in the 32 000 bracket thats people make 41 000 a year these are middle income american
668599 and when we look at his compilation of bad ideas at a time of economic crisis at a time when were in an energy crisis when we look at his bad judgment to our to regard national security situation and the two wars we are fighting we will pose the question stipulating the fact that barack obama is the biggest celebrity in the world do the american people want to elect the worlds biggest celebrity or do they want to elect an american hero somebody who is a leader somebody who has the right ideas to deal in a serious way with the problems we face and that will be the fundamental choice that americans will make as they focus in on who to elect the 44th president of the united states 97 days from now this is a close election weve seen much presumption from the obama campaign whether it is the construction of his own presidential seal and many other presumptuousness on his part and the american people will decide at the end of the day
668600 instead of whining about obamas popularity mccain should concentrate on learning world geography
668601 all those who have the idea to put additional pressure on serbia are knocking on open doors because not only has serbia shown its will and determination but it also has made concrete steps related to this co operation
668602 today nobody can tell serbia it is avoiding international justice and it does not respect international law
668603 terrorise and demoralise the bosnian muslim and bosnian croat population
668604 who tend to promote some of the activities that are directed against our own citizen or our allies
668605 i explained i was with the state press but the secret service man said that didnt matter and that i would have to go
668606 i would first express regret that your reporter was moved and i can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that race had nothing to do with it
668607 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move
668608 my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
668609 at the end of the day your reporter was in the wrong place i do not know why the other reporters were not moved the rest of the local press should have been moved as well

668659 with his catastrophic crisis management and contradictory information rogge has seriously undermined the olympic spirit and respect for human rights in china
668660 i am not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
668661 the ioc never really took a clear stance and didnt really press the chinese to stick to the promises they made on human rights and press freedom
668662 i dont understand why the chinese government once again limited internet access and sparked international skepticism
668663 this censorship is a blow against press freedom whether its before during or after the olympic games
668664 one of the most striking aspects of our study was the demonstration that 40 of patients starting antiretroviral therapy in recent years have concurrent tuberculosis underscoring the public health importance of improving affordable treatment options for patients infected with hiv and tuberculosis

668689 the one thing you didnt mean was trollius internetius because in a bygone and more classical world
668690 we have three people unaccounted for but the information is very unclear
668691 when firefighters pulled out of the station a few blocks away they saw a large orange fire ball
668692 i could probably watch a program about each one of those
668693 this was a show that was original unique instantly addictive

668695 a quick search of google news indicates that dell itself did not use the term in press releases or discussions with indexed english language media sources from 1996 to 2006
668696 one of the most striking aspects of our study was the demonstration that 40 of patients starting antiretroviral therapy in recent years have concurrent tuberculosis underscoring the public health importance of improving affordable treatment options for patients infected with hiv and tuberculosis
668697 it shows when you start antiretroviral therapy you may start them on a drug which may compromise their tb therapy which is important but this needs more research

668705 the consultants scope of work is understood to cover all activities necessary to accomplish the stated scope of the services whether or not a specific activity is cited in the terms of reference
668706 the consultant shall assume full responsibility of the tender documents including its completeness and quality
668707 but it is debatable whether the same can be said of coyne et bellier and bks at least with regard to the lack of inspection and verification of the concrete outlet structures at the bottom of the dam the place where the accident occurred
668708 that rehabilitation of the dam implied inspecting all its components including the bottom outlet structures because of their important role in the functioning of the dam as a whole
668709 to inspect and assess the general state of the dam and recommend possible work to be done so that the rehabilitation would produce the desired results that is that the dam would be fully operational and secure in a situation of the lake being completely full
668710 found it strange that the area of the dam where the accident occurred had not been inspected
668711 while the dam is not fully repaired which could take one to two years if the necessary funds are available it will be very difficult to guarantee water for uses downstream with a negative impact on various investments in irrigation projects
668712 limitations on the use of water from the dam lake could worsen the water supply crisis for the local population for their fields and for their livestock
668713 agricultural and livestock production in downstream areas already hit by drought could be reduced
668714 problems of food security and the occurrence of pockets of hunger among the people whose crops were flooded
668715 no ara sul technician was formally trained as was contractually required
668716 in the past some training was undertaken in portugal for ara sul staff some of whom however are no longer with the institution consultation of the observation instruments should be complemented with visual inspection of the dam but we were shown no documentation as to how this visual inspection should be undertaken
668717 this is a complex social issue and as a government we are working to combat alcohol related harm right across the victorian community

668723 i am sure that come the 9th of august the day after the opening ceremony the magic of the games and the flawless organisation will take over
668724 everybody was talking about it when they opened the curtains this morning
668725 i think that it impacts on the mood in the village
668726 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
668727 hiv aids is still one of the worlds greatest humanitarian challenges no question about it
668728 it is a challenge were meeting and a lot of it has to do with pepfar
668729 britains denials that its territories have been used for extraordinary rendition were dramatically undermined last night after the united nations claimed that diego garcia has been used as a detention centre to hold us suspects
668730 development strategies must be country owned to reflect what is right for us and not borrowed policies
668731 we must move away from the use of the hoe and cutlass
668732 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
668733 what we learn will not change the fact that this has been a poorly handled investigation that has lasted 6 years and already has resulted in a trail of embarrassment and personal tragedy
668734 its curious if hardly surprising that none of the major outlets reporting the news bothered to note that the attacks were all made on perceived
668735 no i didnt i didnt know what his affiliations where and thats a good question
668736 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
668737 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
668738 the work became even more intense in the aftermath of the 2001 anthrax attack as the field grew tremendously with billions my caps in new federal support for research on anthrax and other potential biological weapons my caps and to buy new drugs or vaccines to handle a possible future attack
668739 and to create new weapons for use in a possible future attack by the us military
668740 has the unprecedented boom in biodefense research made the country less secure by multiplying the places and people with access to dangerous germs
668741 we are putting america at more risk not less risk
668742 adherence to institute safety procedures by laboratory personnel is lax
668743 apart from the threat from insiders some public health experts believe money being used to study obscure pathogens that are not a major disease problem could be better directed to study known killers like influenza or aids
668744 we have a fragmented and underfunded public health system at the local state and federal level that does not allow us to effectively detect and track disease outbreaks in real time
668745 dark winter showed just how unprepared we are to deal with bioterrorism
668746 it pointed out that there were significant challenges to all levels of government
668747 an outside panel of experts provided guidance to niaid on its biodefense research agenda and identified the insufficient amount of biosafety level 3 bsl 3 and bsl 4 lab space as a significant barrier to progress
668748 to know that we can do this research and not do it would be irresponsible
668749 primarily on the scientific and technical merit of the applications as assessed by peer review and on the bus ability to contribute to the overall niaid
668750 i am thrilled with the national institutes of healths decision to designate boston and bu medical center as an national biocontainment laboratory site
668751 bostons role as a center of bio medical and research activity
668752 its a very important part of our efforts in the state to be on the cutting edge of research
668753 the construction of this new center will solidify massachusetts position as the national leader for cutting edge biotech research it will generate 1 300 construction jobs 660 new permanent positions and countless other economic opportunities for local businesses and residents
668754 bu removed or penciled over a number of lines in the response to the federal government that is even though they handed a copy to ace and to others they made it impossible for some of it to be read because they said that was confidential information
668755 they demonstrated something very important to us and that is the ability to infiltrate and take deadly materials out of those laboratories and to escape detection
668756 we have seen these incidents happen around the world and with the tularemia incident in 2002 and 2004 and not to mention the mercury spills and the contamination of water 9 11 the mail issue with anthrax being mailed there are too many things that are happening now that put doubt in your mind about how secure is this lab
668757 covertly collected air samples in close proximity to the passengers
668758 cia association with fort dietrich involved the special operations division sod of that facility this division was responsible for developing special applications for biological warfare agents and toxins its principal customer was the u s army its concern was with the development of both suitable agents and delivery mechanisms for use in paramilitary situations both standard biological warfare agents and biologically derived toxins were investigated by the division
668759 although some cia originated documents have been found in the project files it is clear that only a very limited documentation of activities took place
668760 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate
668761 hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
668762 hes been a wonderfully successful captain englands most successful in terms of test match wins and is surely one of englands greatest ever captains
668763 in terms of playing captaining leading decision making michael vaughan is the best man for the job
668764 i know what hes been going through its a wonderful job but its also a job that becomes all consuming he said hes not been himself at home and wanted to get back to being me
668765 the job gets on top of you its a great job but youre thinking about it all the time
668766 the pressure eventually bears down on you and if youre not getting runs as well then it becomes very difficult
668767 but he wouldnt have liked to make it a difficult choice for the selectors if he hadnt got runs at the oval
668768 i am very disappointed for michael vaughan and for england because i thought he was an excellent captain and leader
668769 i said on my radio show last week that i thought he should stay on as england captain
668770 he is a terrific player and like collingwood is probably only one innings away from resurrecting his form
668771 the timing is never right when to resign but it tends to be when you have lost a series i think that pressure from outside has built up sufficient for him to say enough is enough
668772 this decision has been something that has crossed my mind for some time i had every ambition to lead the england team to the next ashes series 2009 but as england captain i feel ive run out of steam
668773 that would be ultimate dream to play for nine inch nails
668774 just the way he pieces the music together is just amazing the guitars the drums its just amazing this is my first time seeing em i cant wait
668775 proceeded to describe to the group a very long and detailed homicidal plan and intention to that he had bought a bulletproof vest had obtained a gun a very detailed plan to kill his co workers
668776 attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer
668777 bruce told me that all of them had been detained at different locations his children and his wife and then himself and they were extensively questioned and they told his wife and his children some disturbing things about their father being a murderer
668778 i think simply bruce was a high strung person and very sensitive and this pressure was just simply adding to his depression that ultimately caused him to kill himself
668779 deep in my heart i wont believe he had anything to do with it until i see him in the afterlife and he says yeah i did it russ thats the only way im really going to believe it deep in my heart thats the truth
668780 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems with qantas but we think it is prudent to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
668781 we want to double check we want to triple check we want to be able to say to the public everything is ok
668782 if there are significant safety problems the public has a right to know
668783 well be doing our best to answer all the questions so the public can have confidence travelling with qantas

668806 wispa is a true icon loved by its fans everywhere

668832 represented the old guard of al qaeda so it is going to be very difficult to replace him
668833 this was a huge success for the americans in their pursuit of al qaeda leaders
668834 al qaeda usually replace these people in this situations but actually they wont have the people with the determination and expertise of this man
668835 he managed to experiment a lot with chemical and biological weapons in the tora bora area
668836 maybe he has disciples but theres no one with his skills he knows the ideology of al qaeda very well and i dont believe he will be easily replaced by other people
668837 afghanistan is seeing the worst violence since the taliban was ousted in 2001

668856 president bush has been working with the iraqis to encourage them to work out their differences and get the provincial elections law passed
668857 to that end he spoke to several senior iraqi officials yesterday as they near the end of the legislative process both to offer encouragement and stress the importance of getting the law through the final stages of the legislative process
668858 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
668859 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
668860 it was a democratic process why did they reject it
668861 we arabs are against any new resolution that could affect our presence in this city
668862 my start was normal i was on the outside going into turn one but then i had to go a little bit wide and dropped back a place
668863 then the problems started on the third lap when my brakes started to overheat particularly the rear ones and i had to move my brake balance forward from that point on i had problems with lots of locking on the front and understeer and it was difficult to handle the car considering this my race pace was not bad in the first stint but then in the second stint i was held up by the group in front when i was quite light and lost some time there in the final stint i had a puncture on the front right under braking and then the brakes gave up and my race was over overall i am disappointed because weve worked hard for the whole weekend and then after three laps we have a problem so i couldnt show the performance i wanted to
668864 it was a tough race as we were fighting quite a lot we were quite heavy at the beginning of the race but the pace really wasnt too bad and i could keep up with the others in front of me in fact the two williams were only two laps heavier than me when i was just behind them but i was keeping the same pace even at the end of the race in the last few laps i could do a 1min 22 6 which is a good lap time in terms of strategy we did well that was the maximum we could get from this race we just need a step forward for the next few races
668865 an exciting race for our guys with both driving very good races under the circumstances giancarlo lost a position at the start but both drove good first stints we put them on slightly different strategies with a short middle stint for adrian and a longer one for giancarlo we were able to jump some people in the pit stops with giancarlo and although he just wasnt able to hold it in the final pit stop at least we were able to race with the group in front adrian had a brake problem very early on which meant we had to wind his brake balance forward and ultimately he had to stop with a puncture caused by this brake failure while its disappointing not to get two cars to the finish we can be pleased with the teams performance and both the drivers who all pushed very hard this weekend
668866 there have been two sides to this weekend it got off to a good start and then i had some problems in qualifying
668867 the race also started quite well as i had a good pace then it all went to hell at the first pit stop as the guys had to use the fire extinguisher and i got a lot of foam on my visor it happened again at the second stop and this time i had foam inside and outside my visor and couldnt see a thing so had to make another stop to get it cleaned by this stage we had lost so much time there was nothing else to do and i preferred to make the extra stop as the lack of visibility was dangerous
668868 i didnt have a very good pit stop and that caused the engine to overheat and that messed up some parts and i had no choice but to retire its a shame as i had a good pace from the car this afternoon i made a mistake in running wide at the last corner on the first lap and lost a lot of places i was stuck behind barrichello and it was impossible to overtake this hasnt been a good weekend and that goes back to friday when i suffered reliability problems and then came the disappointment this afternoon
668869 there can be no excuses this was a bad weekend for the whole team it seems that budapest is not vettels place as we had technical problems on friday and this continued in the race as he had to retire at this time we are not exactly sure what the failure was but we suspect it was due to overheating as for bourdais he made a good start moving up from 19th on the grid to 16th then at his first pit stop on lap 32 we had a problem with the fuel system which caught fire fortunately it was extinguished in time but the problem reoccurred at his second stop on this occasion he had to make a further stop to have the extinguisher foam removed from his visor as he could not see we must now carry out a full investigation of all the problems on both cars after what was a very disappointing weekend for the whole team
668870 this is a great moment it feels fantastic really this is a moment i have been targeting for many years now and to achieve this goal is pleasing i hope this is the first of many
668871 of course im very happy with this win we have been in a position to fight for race wins this season but there was always something going wrong today lewis hamilton and massa were fastest in the r ace but i tried to push massa hoping he would have a mechanical failure and it seemed to have worked
668872 whos listing is it oh jane smith it will be overpriced

668874 it takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it if you think about that youll do things differently
668875 the record is called departure for a number of reasons
668876 there have been departures in my career in my personal life ive learned a lot since doing my first couple of records i think ive landed in the most comfortable place ive ever been musically as the style of music my vocals and the lyrical content of the songs on this album i co wrote several songs on the new album and learned a lot from the producers i worked with in the process of writing for my own project i wound up writing bleeding love with ryan tedder for leona lewis departure has a little more of mature sound than what my fans previously heard from me but this is the road that im on right now and its the road that i believe theyll join with me

668878 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding by travers and milgram
668879 via the lens provided on the world by messenger we find that there are about 7 degrees of separation among people they wrote
668880 they could create large meshes of people who could be mobilized with the touch of a return key
668881 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while

668884 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
668885 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
668886 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
668887 yes this icon career retirement thing is complicated but heck a whole bunch of military service people have died in the last seven years in afghanistan and iraq and well quite frankly that kind of thing is far more important than my fat eletist pro sports ego

668898 the elections should push through regardless of the peace talks to strengthen armm voters belief in the electoral process the credibility of elections in armm has always been doubted because of repeated incidents of goon politics cheating and violence against voters and poll workers particularly public school teachers who man the election precincts
668899 because there are so many ict related conferences and many places in the philippines and elsewhere are seeking to become ict centers it will be important to think carefully about how lapu lapu city can distinguish itself meaningfully and convincingly from these other places and why attending conferences in lapu lapu city is going to be a reasonable investment in terms of time for ict executives compared to other competing conferences meetings and other events

668916 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
668917 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
668918 obama cant really effectively attack mccain it would damage his clean cut image

668947 instead of using my weapon i choked him out and we were able to capture and interrogate him
668948 the biggest differences are that we spend quite a bit of time fighting with weapons and learning how combatives fit into missions we are always armed and the person we are fighting is usually armed so grappling over control of the weapon is whats really going on you dont see too many people at your typical mma gym grappling over control of a rifle or a knife
668949 not only does it save the lives of u s soldiers but it also saves enemy lives
668950 when a soldier is well trained he has the option to use a lesser amount of force there are many situations now that involve soldiers restraining and detaining people whom they could clearly have killed under the rules of engagement
668951 because of the nature of the war we are going into buildings more
668952 when a soldier enters a building he doesnt know if he will end up helping someone or fighting them for his life
668953 the development of the combatives program in the army has moved so far so quickly and as a soldier its reassuring to see the army getting the right people to train us
668954 i wrestled in high school and at u s military academy we were required to take a semester of boxing each of those sports requires its own level of conditioning but mma combines both of them you have to train in a much broader way

669029 if i should marry a socialite i suspect it might not work because i know the kind of person i am you know being a popular artiste is another kettle of fish entirely you know too that my father used to be very popular while he was alive it had really bothered me for a long time but i thank god for answering my prayers with the kind of man he gave me he is so easygoing does not want noise and allows me to focus on my job without distraction
669030 i must tell you that we just met in a normal way funnily enough he did not know anything about me when we met even though i had been very popular on the screen before he met me he was not aware of anyone called nike peller in fact when i told him that i was nike abiola he asked which of the abiolas incidentally he said he was a classmate of my brother kayode abiola peller it was later that i told him that i was an actress and he didnt care i must tell you that getting someone like that on a neutral level suits my kind of life it gives me the confidence that he got hooked to me as i am not because of what i am you know there are some men out there whose target is to date actresses they watch on the screen and dump them afterwards they take delight in counting their conquests among the popular artistes around
669031 i would say i had two relationships one in england and one in nigeria here i believe that perhaps god did not want them to work one of the reasons for the break ups was hearsay you know we are always on locations and when you cannot trust the person you are going out with the relationship is meaningless if a man tells you that he is at oyingbo believe him if you dont want to give yourselves unnecessary stress that was what happened with the guy in england then for the guy in nigeria i think it was more of his family background he is a christian while i am a muslim maybe his family didnt want him to get married to a muslim but that does not really matter whether you are a muslim or a christian does not really matter what i want is where i can get happiness my present man is a christian but he understands everything about me we relate like a brother and sister i am always happy around him the guy trusts me and i trust him
669032 as a muslim i can get married to someone who has 10 15 wives so far i am happy with him it is between him and me that is no big deal
669033 i dont allow this actress thing or stardom to get into my head let me tell you something there are some things i cannot do as an actress because of my name after my job the next thing is my home no matter what a wife should be submissive to her husband even if she is a millionaire you know i am a muslim and in islam you have to submit yourself to your man even if you are the richest woman on earth
669034 he cannot say that because it worked i would say that my father was only entertaining the crowd in his own way i am not surprised that you said my brother called my fathers magic fake he is now a pastor and believes that the old things have gone away my brother then was involved in it in fact he was then known as young peller we used to travel together to perform magic everywhere but now that he is born again no problem all what i know is that my father was the greatest man in his lifetime he was known all over the world because of his wonderful magic he handled it professionally together with his family
669035 you cannot practise magic all alone when professor peller was alive most of the children were much younger and it was easy for him to involve us in his trade it was a family thing but now we have grown and are scattered all over the world that is why it is not easy for any of us to continue if by tomorrow someone says he wants to start he will have to recruit either his family train them or get people around it is a very serious business all the instruments are still intact nobody has touched them but what i think has happened is that people have moved on they no longer believe in the stunts but while the man was alive he did his best entertaining his fans
669036 even if you were not his child you were treated same way that is why then there were so many people igbo hausa name it that my father catered for he was kind hearted and generous to a fault we lived in a very big environment there was peace in the family the role otunba toyin is playing now is what he inherited from our father he will call up everyone to find out what is happening to everyone otunba toyin is our first born he lives in ibadan if he is coming now you will think it is our father that is coming he so much looks like him
669037 thank god you know my brother the pastor we are all light skinned in our house how can anyone say i bleached my skin i am naturally light in complexion those who say i bleached dont know us look at me very well do i look like someone who bleached i dont know whether you have met someone who bleached you will see some patches here and there which i dont have if they have said i tone my skin yes what is wrong in that it is normal for a light complexioned person to tone her skin a little which i do
669038 i started acting while in the primary school the man that taught me how to sing dance and act is still alive he is mr dokun awolere a newscaster at ltv8 ikeja he used to be my teacher in the primary school and i am very proud of him but coming to acting in the real sense of it i was in school institute of technology in akure in 1987 when a friend of mine asked me to come for auditioning i told them that i had lectures unless they wanted to shift it for me till weekend i remember very well that i was paid three thousand naira then because i played the lead role the film was aye lu i appeared in mosebolatan by baba sala but i was among the crowd i remember that baba used to perform magic with baba sala then in ibadan
669039 i tell people that i was invited to the industry not that i lobbied or did something nasty to get roles no i did not date anyone in the industry before i became one of them i had been close to most of those in charge then the likes of oga bello who was my in law some people did not know that i was not the one married to him it was my sister idiat peller though she is late now

669070 i tell her she has to move its not a life
669071 nowhere in the new testament is there any explicit commandment that marriage should be monogamous or any explicit commandment forbidding polygamy
669072 now indeed in our time and in keeping with roman custom it is no longer allowed to take another wife
669073 if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans marry women of your choice two or three or four but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with them then only one
669074 although monogamy may be ideal for the expression of love between husband and wife the church should consider that in certain cultures polygyny is socially acceptable and that the belief that polygyny is contrary to christianity is no longer tenable
669075 it is quite conceivable that these genocidal techniques nuclear biological chemical could produce so drastic an imbalance among the sexes that plural marriage would become a necessary means of survival then contrary to previous custom and law an overriding natural and moral inclination might arise in favour of polygamy in such a situation theologians and church leaders would quickly produce weighty reasons and biblical texts to justify a new conception of marriage
669076 children would be better served if family augmentation rather than only separation and dissolution were seen as options
669077 christianity cannot compromise on the question of polygamy if present day christianity cannot do so it is to its own detriment islam has permitted polygamy as a solution to social ills and has allowed a certain degree of latitude to human nature but only within the strictly defined framework of the law christian countries make a great show of monogamy but actually they practice polygamy no one is unaware of the part mistresses play in western society in this respect islam is a fundamentally honest religion and permits a muslim to marry a second wife if he must but strictly forbids all clandestine amatory associations in order to safeguard the moral probity of the community
669078 polygamy is it a modern answer to the black man womans problems by geocities com

669123 you cant take what you just said and apply it to non western societies
669124 now what really stood out in your last post was this wives have to share your affection im selfish and i want all my husbands affection so let me ask you if your husband broke his commitment to fidelity isnt that the same thing are you not sharing his affections then
669125 in polygynist or polyandrist marriages everyone receives due respect loyalty time love etc
669126 raven that selfishness is exactly what drove me to polygamy i dont want to be anyones property the happiness aspect is relative im happier now in a polygamous relationship than i was in a monogamous relationship i cant deal with the selfishness
669127 in addition i dont know how people could even get caught in a polygamous relationship it would take someone to report to the police that a couple is having sex and living with another adult and even then whats illegal about that i dont have any kids but im confident that the children wont grow up with 2 mommies but rather with a mom dad and mommies friend who helps
669128 wills new insurance policies for non family members and prenups keep all the legal matters under control
669129 the trick is to buy everything in bulk as far as lotion tampons hair products etc the upside is having another woman to do hair dividing up responsibilities and chores is a plus too
669130 do you think that polygamy should even be illegal why or why not
669131 ravenesque i apologize for not replying sooner women in polygamous relationships are happier in those relationships as well ive been in only one marriage involving more than 1 wife and both women were happy with the arrangement
669132 disrupts natural competition whos competing with who there r generally more women than men leaving a lot of single women
669133 divorce is the worst thing that could ever happen i believe in prenups but other than that trusting my previous common law wives not to sue is a problem ive never had i think women only sue when the guy lies to her or if they never communicated with each other about the subject i have a good understanding with anyone i get involved with no police amp no lawyers amp theyve always agreed if i couldnt trust them to uphold that agreement then i wouldnt involve myself with them
669134 im curious wut do u mean by wanting all of ur husbands affection
669135 what is the difference in husband wife affection vs friends affection besides sex
669136 i despise this disgusting practice and any women agreeing to it are backwards
669137 i despise this disgusting practice and any women agreeing to it are backwards
669138 raven sorry just to clarify yes i do cuddle with my friends kiss them hug them and i have terms of endearment for each one of them i must admit that i dont cuddle or kiss my male friends though but we do the handshake hug thing and we all have nicknames for each other pop bigdog kenfolk etc the girls have girly names like sugaduga amp tt
669139 or friends with someone youre attracted to but decided to just remain friends
669140 and if youre still friends would you disown them if you got married or got sexually involved with someone else
669141 i despise this disgusting practice and any women agreeing to it are backwards
669142 you can only analyze it from the eurocentric worldview if you want to talk african tradition then thats different
669143 in the traditional way polygyny is not decided by the men
669144 and if people are over emphasizing sex instead of letting it be natural then the form of marriage has no real substance whether its monogamy or polygamy
669145 raven women still have property rights in a polygamous relationship amp like crystal says women still have all the power
669146 i dont think youve ever seen a nodern polygamous relationship other than whats on tv youre still thinking of polygamy at a time when women didnt have any rights in a modern polygamous relationship its no different than living with your best girlfriend you have your things she has hers and yall share some things
669147 loving someone has nothing to do with sex power or property
669148 raven sorry just to clarify yes i do cuddle with my friends kiss them hug them and i have terms of endearment for each one of them i must admit that i dont cuddle or kiss my male friends though but we do the handshake hug thing and we all have nicknames for each other pop bigdog kenfolk etc the girls have girly names like sugaduga amp tt
669149 or friends with someone youre attracted to but decided to just remain friends
669150 and if youre still friends would you disown them if you got married or got sexually involved with someone else
669151 theres a difference between not hugging not kissing not cuddling with my exs and disowning them
669152 or friends with someone youre attracted to but decided to just remain friends
669153 and if youre still friends would you disown them if you got married or got sexually involved with someone else
669154 you can only analyze it from the eurocentric worldview if you want to talk african tradition then thats different
669155 in the traditional way polygyny is not decided by the men it is was women traditionally who made the decision polygyny ensured that a womans lineage was continued when women out number men by
669156 and if people are over emphasizing sex instead of letting it be natural then the form of marriage has no real substance whether its monogamy or polygamy
669157 my feelings remain the same for people whether im married or not i love everyone the same whether im attracted to them or not i dont marry someone because im attracted to them i marry them because they better me emotionally spiritually financially etc etc every relationship is different and i value relationships based on what the person has given me tangibles intangibles a lot of people have been good to me in my life and i could never cast them aside for anything that would be a slap in the face to someone who has given me so much
669158 and the whole std thing remember polygamy has nothing to do with sex
669159 at some point you had to make the decision to have sex with your husband right what things do you consider before having sex with someone
669160 polygyny has nothing to do with fgm that sickness was brought by islam islamic and arab cultures suppress a womans sexuality b c they fear it african muslims who practice that are no different than african american christians who cheat and beat their wives
669161 if a woman is choosing a traditional form of marriage how is that then chattel and a piece of property polygyny was designed or any other form like polyandry women with multiple husbands to promote healthy human sexual relations
669162 a lots of single women in a given society go around sleeping with different men to fulfill biological urges or she could marry into a loving polygynous family where she has equal rights to the husband and the same priveliges or she could remain single and end up with hiv aids for having slept around with different men

669164 nobody is asking you to be a polygamist so why the hostility even in the us almost 60 000 people live in polygamous relationships whether legal or not one thing pple have to face is that even in america family forms are changing whether the masses agree participate despise or not

669177 monogamy and polygamy are forms of marriages that i respect and regard and neither of them is better or less than the other
669178 when men outnumber women in a society b c of war and natural selection
669179 christainity in the otpermits men to have more than one wife
669180 the it has only been in recent history that christianity changed and rearranged books of the bible and more importantly that the christain church has criminalized it ever heard of the confrence of nicea
669181 islam however under the quran permits a man to have no more than four wives and the only reason is b c of war and so that the children of widows will not be orphans thats the only way in islam thats valid again arabs mix theirculture with their religion and create a mess in which the family structure is unjust to women again thats arab culture not african

669187 they may practice it but not out in the open cuz its illegal

669190 i think they are ignoring the point youve made which is the general benefit of a polygamous society if women outnumber the men monogamy is impossible and man sharing is an inevitable by product yet those women dont get the benefit of protection under law or any real recognized obligation of the men to them
669191 i think the black community in particular would definitely benefit from getting rid of the stigmas attached to polygamy there are 87 black men for every 100 black women only 25 or so of black women are childless by the time they are 30 while nearly 50 of black men are childless by that time clearly a lot of man sharing is already going on in our society and the vast majority of these women have no claim on the men that father their children
669192 monogamy has been a failure as a marital arrangement in our communities
669193 besides if an individual doesnt want to be in that type of marriage they dont have too
669194 i think they are ignoring the point youve made which is the general benefit of a polygamous society if women outnumber the men monogamy is impossible and man sharing is an inevitable by product yet those women dont get the benefit of protection under law or any real recognized obligation of the men to them
669195 i think the black community in particular would definitely benefit from getting rid of the stigmas attached to polygamy there are 87 black men for every 100 black women only 25 or so of black women are childless by the time they are 30 while nearly 50 of black men are childless by that time clearly a lot of man sharing is already going on in our society and the vast majority of these women have no claim on the men that father their children
669196 monogamy has been a failure as a marital arrangement in our communities
669197 again its an idea polygyny that simply doesnt hold any benefit for 1 most black folks 2 particularly educated and affluent black folks 3 particularly educated affluent black women
669198 besides if an individual doesnt want to be in that type of marriage they dont have too
669199 maybe but most folks dont see monogamous relationships as intrusive they see it as a natural relationship in a society that doesnt need to quickly increase its numbers
669200 you wrote a lot of words but most of it boiled down to making tone arguments
669201 you dont see a benefit in polygamy personally and you look down on anyone that could benefit or sees the benefit in this practice
669202 this is basically an argument for why you shouldnt be in a polygamous relationship rather than someone else
669203 no need to respond to that its just a personal opinion presented as true for most people made through a tone argument
669204 yes there are more women than men so of course women who are less attractive to most men are going to be missing out
669205 however marriage as i see it should be an option for whoever wants it not just the few that society confers on privileges that would make them attractive to the programed majority of men
669206 the simple way to give folks the opportunity to marry if they so chose is to remove the cap on male marital partners created by monogamy
669207 your third point or rather question male fertility statistics are found on the census and health department websites i invite you to bring whatever counter facts you like but youll find that my argument is not that single women with children are attractive
669208 my argument is that monogamy creates a context where a lot of mothers will be single due to man sharing without the option of a multi spouse household
669209 as the original question asked for the benefits of this marital arrangement this would be one
669210 on to your fourth point we get it you dont like single parents or anybody else you consider low class
669211 why does the rest of society have to live by your values
669212 freedom of choice is also a value since you want to live by your values why begrudge other people the same option
669213 let people individually decide whether or not its a choice they want to make
669214 if you are correct and most people dont value this as an option than what do you have to lose if a few people desire this right to choose
669215 the rest of your post was just a diatribe against people you consider beneath you
669216 but why even include it in a response to me
669217 honestly i prefer not to be used as an excuse to denigrate poor people and single mothers
669218 its a basic question of the pros and cons of polygamy
669219 not a question of how to convince congress to change the laws or how to convince people like you to become polygamists
669220 or whether i am correct and your posts wreak of intolerance for other cultures and belief sets
669221 the validity of that observation is either confirmed or denied by the content of your posts and others reading of them
669222 in all that youve said your basic con is that you and your kind wouldnt do it and if anybody dares suggest otherwise youll go into spam mode and
669223 okay this argument again is not passing the so what test
669224 the point was made and your copious response was lacking in substance
669225 in a monogamous society where women outnumber men women will inevitably be forced to share men
669226 the question at that point is whether people who chose to share partners can benefit from doing so
669227 at the very least they have an agreed upon arrangement that they feel works for their particular context
669228 this is the epitome of having the freedom in the
669229 personal choice and self determination in the absence of a clear threat or harm to others is a right worth respecting

669245 thats hardened him for his senior season hes a very tough guy and extremely talented he can throw any pattern in our playbook and the way he played at the end of last season has made him a more confident quarterback after watching the bowl game a few times he managed that game extremely well and played even better than i thought when we watched it live hes a special talent and his leadership skills are very very good after this season i expect he will be highly mentioned in the same breath with the great quarterbacks weve had at fresno state

669248 there are lots of signs there as you approach the construction zone its 50 kilometers per hour and weve been up there with our radars and theyre doing at least 108 kilometers per hour some people thats double the speed limit
669249 its mostly in the mornings with people on their way to work
669250 the problems not in the afternoon because the construction is on the other side of the street
669251 people just dont want to slow down they dont want to obey the signs they see the passing lane but its not a passing lane when it has been changed when they have a construction zone and those new signs are put up those signs take precedence over the ones that were there for years until the construction is finished

669257 we welcome the opportunity to provide software and services to becta as we have in the commercial sector but we are yet to see how becta intends to make a viable climate for both paid for and free software providers
669258 we hope an open source company is included in the final list because it will benefit both the open source community and children
669259 becta is seeing the light but as an organisation that is supposedly a technology innovator it should have moved into open source three or four years ago

669263 i believe that we can have success in iraq that it is possible
669264 a positive attitude may not solve all your problems but it will
669265 we discussed the bill with the other iraqi parties at the uns office in baghdad yesterday and reached some common agreements
669266 the political consensus should still reflect article 140 of the iraqi constitution to resolve kirkuk issue and other ethnically disputed areas and the constitution
669267 if we do not reach an agreement by tomorrow 3 august then we should rely on the previous election law which is still valid
669268 let he who is without sin cast the first stone
669269 why dont we ever talk about the fact that some of our students are smokin hot and we want to have sex with them
669270 im 29 i took a tenure track job in nowheresville montana population 630 and im single and now i cant get laid what should the academy do about this problem
669271 hey we all know the youth culture in america is a bunch of red bull slurping text messaging vapid little brittney hilton lohan wannabes lets not kid ourselves and pretend that any of these creatures have ever cracked open a book or anything else thats not a can of milwaukees best ice
669272 im going to make a difference in these kids lives
669273 im tired i dont wanna talk about william dean howells im gonna let em go early
669274 das war das gr te familienfest das wir je hatten
669275 es wird f r unsere mannschaft ganz schwer sich den gro en traum von gold zu erf llen
669276 wir wollen diese medaille das ist ganz klar unser ziel
669277 es passiert dass man mal ein weilchen warten muss bis ein aufzug vorbeikommt
669278 das war sch ner warmer regen wir trainieren wie vorgesehen und fangen an uns wohl zu f hlen
669279 das war schon in ordnung leider hatte ich im zweiten umlauf einen abwurf bei olympia werden die karten neu gemischt
669280 i am 17 years old i am from thailand and made a mural about it i was born in a refugee camp because my people are karen and we dont belong to thailand my mom is from burma but we arent allowed to be there so we have to be in camps in thailand my mural has pictures of the camp i lived in
669281 it has to be rigorous because they are preparing these kids to pass the exit exam to get a diploma and to go to college
669282 they serve an incredible niche of young people who come from all over the world and are english language learners
669283 somehow in these schools theyve figured out how to create a community that values difference but that also values trust and support
669284 review of the history of racial segregation in this country confirms that separate schooling has meant unequal schooling
669285 thus we have many good reasons to be wary of the consequences of segregation on the basis of language no matter how good the plan or how benign the intentions
669286 there is one to two hours of english language development at mainstream schools
669287 for some students that works but for others its frightening confusing and frustrating
669288 alle daten werden nach der erfassung zentral gespeichert deshalb ist nichts verloren gegangen

669291 the one question asked of me is whether this is premature because they havent been charged
669292 but thats a criminal threshold a criminal standard and we hold our public officials to a higher standard than that
669293 what weve seen this past week is public officials abusing the trappings of their power
669294 always put the citizens of cuyahoga county first and foremost
669295 the defiant stands taken by dimora and russo this week upon their return to work show that we should not expect them to take the path for the greater good without guidance
669296 i purchased the piano when i discovered that the university s music department needed a piano of this quality it is a particular pleasure that we have it for the mozart anniversary concert coming to the concert will therefore be a double pleasure for me
669297 the concert is a great opportunity to celebrate the important memory of mozart and hear some of the university and city s most talented musicians in the elegant setting of firth hall
669298 listening to the unique poetic sound of the university s beautiful steinway grand piano is the perfect way to relax after a long day
669299 ich hoffe dass alle drei anfang der woche wieder voll ins training einsteigen k nnen und wir am donnerstag mit einer kompletten mannschaft ins olympische dorf einziehen k nnen
669300 we sealed off the whole area and had sea and land patrols but unfortunately fazul got leakage of the intended raid and escaped
669301 our intelligence reports show that he came into the country from somalia to seek medical attention because of a kidney condition
669302 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate
669303 hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
669304 hes been a wonderfully successful captain englands most successful in terms of test match wins and is surely one of englands greatest ever captains
669305 in terms of playing captaining leading decision making michael vaughan is the best man for the job
669306 i know what hes been going through its a wonderful job but its also a job that becomes all consuming he said hes not been himself at home and wanted to get back to being me
669307 the job gets on top of you its a great job but youre thinking about it all the time
669308 the pressure eventually bears down on you and if youre not getting runs as well then it becomes very difficult
669309 but he wouldnt have liked to make it a difficult choice for the selectors if he hadnt got runs at the oval
669310 i am very disappointed for michael vaughan and for england because i thought he was an excellent captain and leader
669311 i said on my radio show last week that i thought he should stay on as england captain
669312 he is a terrific player and like collingwood is probably only one innings away from resurrecting his form
669313 the timing is never right when to resign but it tends to be when you have lost a series i think that pressure from outside has built up sufficient for him to say enough is enough
669314 short term we raise social costs until elites agree to implement our demands or end policies we oppose longer term we accumulate support and develop movement infrastructure and alternative institutions while working toward transforming societys defining relations
669315 why on earth didnt you use something like grails that actually does scale
669316 discards the important and useful concept of structured naming and semantically rich namespaces
669317 we were secretly married in december 2000 and nobody knows our anniversary everyone knows its december but the actual date is hidden its our anniversary and nobody elses were just trying to maintain some form of privacy
669318 atop her 12 cm stiletto heels she moves with the grace of a ballerina
669319 paris is worthy of more than just shopping there is so much to see and to do so many places to visit fashion is not of supreme importance to me like all syrian women i like to be elegant but i always prefer attire that is quiet refined and relaxed at home in damascus i also wear locally made clothes and jewelry i feel very comfortable in them
669320 i tell them the two of you are very cosmopolitan you have excellent english
669321 she represents everything that a good sunni family can be
669322 many syrians tell me theyre tired of syrias current image theyre tired of seeing the jordanians and the moroccans and feeling like theyve been left behind they want style they have a passion for the good life for pleasure and she symbolizes openness and fun people admired hafez assad but he wasnt a fun person he hardly ever smiled and when he did it was a sly fox kind of smile his son bashar is young he has a sense of humor he likes to water ski to drive cars you have no idea how many syrians ask me when asmas going to come to the u s already when were going to get to see her on the morning programs
669323 the official residence of the president next to the peoples palace has never been lived in
669324 it is huge with many salons and you would never have any idea who was in the house with you from day one my parents in law have lived in central damascus we live in this street and we have neighbors with kids playing there and the president plays there sometimes with the kids in the street the only difference between this street and any other street is the barriers its an everyday syrian street and syrian building when i wake up in the morning i hear the birds singing the kids playing and the traffic in the other place you hear nothing its not normal no birds no children no cars
669325 i wouldnt mind going back there for certain things but it would not be a priority for diving yes but not for a lot of other things
669326 i do not have a nanny for my children we were not brought up like that and we dont want our children brought up like that when i have meetings their grandmother lives next door and they go with her it is important for the family to play a role when i have office work i bring my children with me
669327 we were all brought up with a sense that one day you will come home i have three younger brothers and we all speak arabic we all understand the culture the religion the tradition it is not new or alien to us because we were brought up with a sense that one day we will come home
669328 despite her classic british accent when she speaks english i didnt see heads turn when she spoke arabic in public
669329 syrians view her cosmopolitanism as an advantage and not a disadvantage
669330 it is something that joins my husband and me we are both technology oriented
669331 i cant say that i was ever really an emma
669332 i was born in london and lived there for 25 years
669333 but i always knew i was syrian i speak fluent arabic and can read and write in the language im british and arab at the same time and no part of me is diametrically opposed to any other part i am in both worlds simultaneously
669334 i didnt know him as a young boy because there is a 10 year difference but he was always somebody who was there there was very little interaction maybe hello good bye i was 10 and he was 20 and i was playing with my barbies and he was out doing something it was scary
669335 it was very gradual it was not traditional because he is not from that nor am i and his family isnt either each one of them actually is against the norm it was a very gradual natural process
669336 he always tries to see the best in any situation to him everything can be solved you can find solutions to everything and that to me is somebody who is completely open and completely willing to see everything to me this is one of his strongest points
669337 he has a very keen sense of research in the sense of wanting to explore all the possibilities and this is something that guides him throughout his political decisions an example is the camera i am not sure you know but he is a keen photographer very very keen so anytime a new camera comes on the market he will explore the differences between this camera and the one he had not in the sense of perfectionism but in the sense of liking to know what is happening and keeping track of things this is a small example but if you are that keen on photography it shows up in a lot of things
669338 its not a question of asking or giving it is a question of having an open dialogue always between us from the small things to the larger things and because he is a conversationalist and because he likes to know different opinions and he likes to benefit from everything around him
669339 in the way she finishes a story that bashar starts and it pleases him in the way they care for their children i think theyre a very good team
669340 but i think that if i were to speak with her father today hed be proud of her and of her activity
669341 it was the correct decision and it came at the right time together my husband and i make a solid team as a couple of course but also on the professional level were involved together in the profound change that is occurring in our country its a wonderful privilege and a great honor to invest yourself in the development and growth of syria alongside your husband
669342 there were a lot of questions about why some people thought that she will no longer be seen she has disappeared she lives in a big house and we will never see her again some people thought that traditionally here first ladies have not played an active role and maybe she does not want to play one nobody knew the reason was that we both my husband and i thought that i needed to meet the people and understand them first
669343 i was able to spend the first couple of months wandering around meeting other syrian people it was my crash course
669344 because people had no idea who i was i was able to see people completely honestly i was able to see what their problems were on the ground what people are complaining about what the issues are what peoples hopes and aspirations are and seeing it firsthand means you are not seeing it through someone elses eyes it wasnt to spy on them it was really just to see who they are what they are doing
669345 why do i drive my own car i like to drive it
669346 because you see the peoples faces and you interact with them directly why do i go to the supermarket to buy groceries yes there is someone to do it for me but why do i do it one because i enjoy it and two because im seeing other women other children other people and im getting a sense of prices and a sense of what people are buying and that is something that reports or advisers cannot give you because everybody has their own perception
669347 i admire how fashionable she is and i also think that the face she presents internationally is important to many syrians to show that there is a class of women in syria who are not covered with the hijab or the veil
669348 that there is someone there who is not a product of the israeli arab conflict and who proposes different positions asma brings to the government the need to integrate in the world economy and in order to do this she cannot remain isolated
669349 the more we invest in the cities the more migration there is to them investment such as a new tunnel in damascus that cost 300 million syrian pounds how much of that could have been used in rural development if i put 100 000 pounds in a village it will have a much bigger impact
669350 the system does not allow you to stray from the target or to lose focus here in syria if someone takes a day off people ask where is he whats his phone number hold on lets ask in administration and they have a number that was last updated 20 years ago
669351 were helping a weaving company get into the market but after that theyre on their own theres competition and that will be the judge of whether theyre good enough
669352 he wants modernization but he doesnt want a situation in which the government can fire him the businessman wants development but for the market to continue being closed because he reaps a benefit from this
669353 everyone looks at development from his own angle instead of looking at the development of the state
669354 and we must ensure that there are other opportunities we need to find the correct balance between creating opportunities and risk management this is the key to what syria is becoming today its a process of change that were undergoing
669355 she goes along with this whether she wants to or not i asked her some very tough questions but she stood behind her husband and behind the administrations policies
669356 i think that people need to see the man behind the presidency they need to see what his values are his ethics his personal traits then theyll be able to better understand who he his and what hes trying to do
669357 the new lion of damascus bashar assad and modern syria

669372 winning this award has given everybody who is a part of the blog a great surge of enthusiasm and belief in the power of and interest in educational blogging
669373 winning this award is a testament to the commitment of the students in shaping the learning and teaching of the future this exciting new medium for communicating and disseminating information couldn t be more relevant to the approach to learning that the cilass student ambassador network san is trying to promote the use of technology discussion of ideas and accessibility to the wider community
669374 we would like to thank everyone who voted for the blog and to encourage surfers and bloggers to log on and take a look at what we are doing
669375 we are at the start of a long and fruitful journey into snow sports engineering the hope is to see wildfire on the podium at the next winter olympics in vancouver for 2010 for now it s just good to see our research going downhill fast
669376 this research clearly demonstrates that science and engineering aren t just confined to laboratories or computer simulations and that they can be applied to exciting areas such as sport
669377 i am delighted to be welcoming leading palaeontologists from around the world to the university and to the city sheffield is an important place for our association because it is where it all began with our first conference back in the 1950 s the city has changed dramatically since then and i am looking forward to showing fellow palaeontologists the botanical gardens and the fascinating work that is taking place there
669378 very little work has been done on this research area for several decades but it has suddenly become very topical with the advent of global warming we present for the first time a new north atlantic sea surface temperature record which will be a valuable resource for scientists striving to understand the effects of ocean variability and climate change in the north atlantic
669379 i am honoured and excited to have been chosen as the next vice chancellor of the university of sheffield the university has a great reputation and i look forward to building upon that and shaping our vision of education in the next decade
669380 professor burnett brings an outstanding combination of abilities and achievements in leadership research and teaching he is the right person to build on the excellent work already achieved and our growing global reputation we are extremely happy to have secured his appointment and look forward to welcoming him and his family to sheffield
669381 i am delighted about the appointment of professor burnett who will take over from me after my period in office expires in december 2007 i am sure everyone will join me in extending a traditional warm sheffield welcome to professor burnett and his family
669382 this was a superb well supported event to mark the passing of sorby hall accommodation and campus services on behalf of all the intrepid abseilers is delighted to be making these contributions to two very important local charities
669383 we are extremely grateful to all those who took part in the abseil edale mountain rescue is a voluntary organisation that relies entirely on public support and this is a huge amount to help the team we are currently working hard to raise money for a new operational base that we hope to open in easter 2007 and this donation really does make a difference
669384 we are so grateful for the money raised by staff and students at the university it is particularly fantastic that students are so willing to help others their age funds raised will go towards the teenage cancer trust unit at weston park hospital in sheffield and will really help make a difference for teenagers with cancer

669395 to now be able to prosecute him for the murders
669396 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
669397 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
669398 he very calmly thanked me for ruining his life and opening allowing the fbi to now be able to prosecute him for the murders and that it was all my fault and its going to be my fault that they can now get him
669399 depois de tudo que passamos isso s nos fortalece mais

669407 temeram que essa vis o pudesse ferir a sensibilidade de algum telespectador
669408 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
669409 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
669410 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
669411 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
669412 at the moment our efforts are focused on rescue once that is complete we will investigate the cause
669413 there is no need to panic everything is normalized now
669414 too much pressure was coming to me at that time it was not an ideal situation
669415 we do not have a machine to say what this patient will do
669416 people being agitated to the point of pleading on their knees thats an unusual level of agitation if you have ended up on a psychiatric ward you are a high risk
669417 dr gupta did not actually review the patient himself that would have been the prudent thing to do
669418 mr whetton was agitated he fell to his knees pleading with staff not to discharge him the team were collectively concerned to inform the psychiatrist but no formal examination was made the consultant psychiatrist did not see him as a result of that decision it was agreed he should be sent on home leave i find that this was a contributing factor in mr whettons death
669419 they were returning from the summit when an avalanche at the bottleneck hit them

669421 we dont have names of dead climbers but it has been confirmed that one dutch one norwegian and one french are in the tally of dead
669422 we were told that some climbers are still returning to the camps
669423 the report reveals a number of problems concerning europe s bid to improve its competitiveness those regions featured at the bottom of the rankings generally lack the economic and industrial infrastructure that is a feature of europe s most competitive regions they also tend to be remotely situated at the eastern edge of europe and are unable to connect themselves with the major european markets
669424 not only is there the divide in competitiveness between old and new europe but there is an increasing dependence in europe on its urban and city locations as the source of its competitiveness increasingly we are seeing the continued erosion in the regional competitiveness of locations in some of europe s major economies especially germany
669425 the first lego league is a fantastic opportunity for school children to learn more about science and engineering while having fun at the same time the event has proved very successful with pupils both here and overseas and has encouraged them to seriously consider careers as the scientists and engineers of the future

669431 the problem with flat earters creationists homeopaths and the rest is not so much that they have a duff conception of truth as that they have duff attitudes toward evidence
669432 the stranger must be welcomed and offered the best of what we have
669433 we are delighted that epsrc has awarded us with this prestigious science and innovation award it confirms the commitment and investment the university has already given research at the life science interface and the firm foundations that have already been laid the new funding will allow us not only to maintain and expand our existing research but to accelerate new areas and welcome new ideas and expertise from the rest of the uk science and engineering community
669434 we are honoured that the epsrc has chosen sheffield to take the lead in such an important area of research the new centre will be an asset to the university the city and the uk offering outstanding facilities a huge pool of expertise and a purpose built facility where chemical engineers and biologists can come together to exchange ideas and expertise
669435 this new research centre will make a major contribution to the study of performance and creativity in addition to addressing its research to the academic community it will reach out to amateur and professional musicians working in a wide range of musical traditions the sheffield team will conduct a very exciting investigation of the ways in which composers and performers work creatively together and will commission new works and first performances from composers and performers working in sheffield and in sister institutions in the region it is a demonstration of the ways in which research of a world leading calibre can also engage with a wider public
669436 we are absolutely thrilled to have been awarded this top community accolade our student volunteers play a vital role in the local community and without them many community initiatives in the city wouldn t be possible we are delighted that they have been given the recognition and praise they deserve with this award
669437 i am extremely proud of all the students and supporting staff whose commitment energy and enthusiasm for community projects and initiatives has made this award possible
669438 all the entrants for the royal mail community impact award were of a very high calibre however the university of sheffield s students exceptional contribution to the local community made them clear winners
669439 students are often ambassadors for their community and can go on to be future leaders who can make an even bigger impact in the regions they work and live
669440 computational models of the complex circuits of the basal ganglia are essential if we are to fully understand their function our research has resulted in the first large scale model of the entire basal ganglia that uses spiking neurons it paves the way for further models of this kind which our group are already working on and a greater understanding of diseases of the brain such as parkinson s
669441 parkinson s disease is a disease of the basal ganglia therefore a proper understanding of these brain structures and the activity of their neurons is crucial to help us learn more about this debilitating condition
669442 this is a very exciting discovery for wakefield and we are thrilled that it has been found at our site it is great to think that our building will be on a site occupied by crafts people many hundreds of years ago we are doing all we can to preserve this remarkable piece of history
669443 some may consider that there are better ways of spending the festive season than standing in a pit that once held medieval urine but from an archaeological point of view this discovery is a real christmas bonus
669444 we are still the only university music department in the country which stages at least one operatic production each year and it is a great opportunity for our students to gain experience of music theatre our previous productions have been of the highest calibre and this year s show will be no exception it promises to be an entertaining night out for all
669445 it is a great honour for the university to stage such a prestigious and topical conference and to welcome those speakers who have been so influential in driving forward the important issue of climate change
669446 it is particularly fitting that the conference is being held at the university where our cutting edge environmental research on the carbon cycle biodiversity arctic ecosystems sustainable urban environments and water contribute extensively to the global change research agenda
669447 this is undoubtedly one of the most important environmental conferences being held in the world over the next 12 months
669448 it is a real coup for sheffield to host such a prestigious event and to attract such high calibre speakers and delegates to address the major environmental and economic challenges presented by climate change and what we can all do to cool the planet
669449 we have no doubt that taking positive action to mitigate the adverse impact of climate change is an absolute priority if the region s economy is to survive and grow for future generations
669450 the regional economic strategy clearly identifies the need for us all to work towards a low carbon economy and take action to reduce co2 emissions yorkshire forward is the only regional development agency with a specific co2 emission reduction target

669460 given the approaching rcuk requirements and the advancements made since the roberts review it is timely for universities in our region to consider whether they can do more to attract and retain the very best research staff in the interests of our institutions sustainability and the economic future of our region
669461 this is a great opportunity for representatives from universities across the uk to come together and talk about what they can do to advance opportunities for research staff
669462 this finding suggests a new concept for cancer treatment if we amplify the dna lesions produced at these early stages of tumour development we may create so much damage that the cancer cells dies the advantage of this concept is that only the tumour cells with the dna lesions would be affected
669463 a similar concept already in the pipeline has been used to develop a new method to treat inherited breast cancer and our findings demonstrate that a similar strategy to exploit tumour weaknesses may be used to treat many other types of cancer
669464 oncogene induced senescence is part of the tumorigenesis barrier imposed by dna damage checkpoints
669465 you know i think my mixing job is perfect and i dont want it changed in any way so i guess i really dont need your services after all

669472 ive been a nurse more than 20 years had i ever seen anything like that when i was working i would have reported that doctor in a minute
669473 as he was locked on me i went to push him down and he moved up a bit and it wound up slapping him on the back i feel badly that it went down like that but i am going to stand by my guns that i didnt do anything wrong
669474 address how the intervention used was not appropriate and discuss how the situation could have been handled differently
669475 i am delighted that ants has been recognised as an outstanding project children who are coping with the death of a loved one and a sudden or traumatic change in their family situation can experience a lack of confidence fears and insecurity about relationships
669476 the ants project is a great opportunity to bring children who have similar experiences together to make friends and have fun
669477 i am extremely proud of the students who started up ants it is an excellent scheme that gives bereaved children the chance to feel special and meet children in similar circumstances i am delighted the students dedication and outstanding contribution to this project has been recognised by this nomination

669480 my direct appeal is for every employer in australia when the government delivers and when the aboriginal leaders and the aboriginals themselves deliver work mentor ready aboriginal people to you to employ we ask you to step out to your major role your major part in breaking at last the aboriginal social and monetary poverty cycle and employ these aboriginals
669481 a three to four month short course which is crammed with the industry details specific to that aboriginals future job is what has always been required and what the government is promising to deliver
669482 thats why we need a strong partnership between indigenous leadership our major companies as well as the government itself supporting this plan on the way through
669483 whether youre in aurukun or youre in hopedale youre out in the sticks
669484 we can do the welfare reform to push our people into real work but the bit i could not ever muscle together was the work opportunity part of the jigsaw
669485 and so it was a complete hit to the solar plexus when andrew proposed not a few thousand real jobs in a timeframe but 50 000 guaranteed real jobs

669489 an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last
669490 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be
669491 the day that this country ceases to be free for irreligion it will cease to be free for religion except for the sect that can win political power
669492 a government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away
669493 on two occasions i have been asked pray mr babbage if you put into the machine wrong figures will the right answers come out i am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question
669494 its very important for the citizens of texas to remember that jose medellin brutally and viciously gang raped stomped kicked slashed strangled and murdered two teenage girls in houston
669495 the world court has no jurisdiction here in texas were concerned about following texas law and thats what were doing
669496 if the world sees us ignoring the rights of foreign nationals arrested here there is very little reason for them to recognize the rights of us citizens
669497 mr perry can flex the states judicial muscle and show the world that texans dont bow to the whims of some distant obscure international court
669498 but it would send an unequivocal message to all foreign governments especially mexico that this country doesnt stand by its promises
669499 any one of you fuckin pricks move and ill execute every one of you motherfuckers
669500 fox has learned through a republican official familiar with the situation that four term virginia republican eric cantor is undergoing intense document reviews by john mccains presidential campaign cantor and mccain met privately weeks ago in the hamptons and cantor has helped raise more than 10 million from the jewish community for mccains white house bid cantor is the highest ranking jewish republican in congress and his addition to the ticket is seen by republicans as a pathway to jewish support in florida and a way to secure virginia 13 electoral votes for mccain neither cantor nor dem va gov tom kaine for obama are certain running mate picks and interest in them could be as much diversion as a serious quest for a running mate what is serious is the multi layered chess game going on between the obama and mccain camps over figuring out how to win virginia
669501 we sealed off the whole area and had sea and land patrols but unfortunately fazul got leakage of the intended raid and escaped
669502 our intelligence reports show that he came into the country from somalia to seek medical attention because of a kidney condition
669503 they were returning from the summit when an avalanche at the bottleneck hit them
669504 our liason officer at the base camp confirmed death of five
669505 according to the rumours from the various expeditions at the base camp there should be nine people dead and four still missing
669506 we were told that some climbers are still returning to the camps
669507 were still discussing the possibilities of an operation because the altitude where the accident occured is very high
669508 we can take a helicopter up there to drop medicines and supplies but carrying out any operation is very difficult
669509 christina applegate was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer benefiting from early detection through a doctor ordered mri the cancer is not life threatening christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
669510 im really grateful that acting is the job that was chosen for me
669511 i get really lost when im not working i dont know what im supposed to do with myself thank god for dance class and the new york times crossword puzzle and american idol but acting is what i really have to do
669512 in case he hasnt noticed we are trying to talk with them
669513 the door is open they just need to step through it by suspending their enrichment of uranium
669514 i am not mediating and i dont carry any message from any western country
669515 but to begin again to prepare sanctions resolutions for the u n security council
669516 i follow with deep friendship this great sporting event the most important and awaited on a world level and i wish that it offer the international community a valid example of coexistence among people of different background in the respect of common dignity
669517 each can give their best in the true olympic spirit
669518 to go back into my past and at the same time walk toward the future
669519 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
669520 to now be able to prosecute him for the murders
669521 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
669522 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
669523 he very calmly thanked me for ruining his life and opening allowing the fbi to now be able to prosecute him for the murders and that it was all my fault and its going to be my fault that they can now get him
669524 now appears to be a degree of durability in gains
669525 i think it takes away what obama considers to be an issue that works in his favor and also puts the focus more on the economy and energy prices where he wants to increase taxes during a recession and doesnt really have a plan to bring us to energy independence
669526 the more success we have in iraq and the more that casualties are down and the more troops were able to bring home the more it is a vindication of the surge strategy advocated by john mccain
669527 obviously you could say it helps obama in that his withdrawal timeline no longer appears so out of whack it also helps him with centrist voters and thus makes it harder for republicans to portray him as not ready to be commander in chief
669528 but i still dont like his withdrawal plan because it is rigid and still too fast
669529 on the other hand mr bushs pending withdrawal plans would increasingly demonstrate the surge has been a huge success and thus arguably worrisome that obama does not understand the war we are fighting very well and is not ready to be commander in chief
669530 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
669531 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
669532 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
669533 who i expect to be dealing with over the next 8 to 10 years presidents of course are limited to two four year terms
669534 barack obama has long been his partys presumptive nominee wrote dana milbank of the washington post last week
669535 fresh from his presidential style world tour during which foreign leaders and american generals lined up to show him affection obama settled down to some presidential style business in washington yesterday july 29
669536 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
669537 this is the moment the world has been waiting for adding
669538 pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall
669539 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day demand met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and bottles of hard to find organic brew black forest berry tea and worry about the price of arugula
669540 going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
669541 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
669542 i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
669543 hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
669544 you must understand that you and your men will accompany me in the army
669545 then you will see for yourself what your servant can do
669546 very well i will make you my bodyguard for life
669547 find me a woman who is a medium so i may go and inquire of her
669548 surely you know what saul has done he has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death
669549 as surely as the lord lives you will not be punished for this
669550 i see a spirit coming up out of the ground
669551 the philistines are fighting against me and god has turned away from me he no longer answers me either by prophets or by dreams so i have called on you to tell me what to do
669552 why do you consult me now that the lord has turned away from you and become your enemy the lord has done what he predicted through me the lord has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors to david because you did not obey the lord or carry out his fierce wrath against the amalekites the lord has done this to you today the lord will hand over both israel and you to the philistines and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me the lord will also hand over the army of israel to the philistines
669553 look your maidservant has obeyed you i took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way
669554 let he who is without sin cast the first stone
669555 neither do i condemn you your sins have been forgiven go and sin no more
669556 well maybe he wasnt a witness to the adultery you have to be caught in the act also there must be at least 2 or 3 witnesses
669557 man shall not lie with man as with a woman it is an abomination their blood is upon them surely they shall be put to death
669558 admittedly im not infallible so i cant be 100 sure but im 95 sure that the catholic church which i follow is infallible thats good enough for me
669559 im not infallible but at least im 95 sure that the scriptures are infallible and im 95 sure that im reading them correctly
669560 heck i was raised by good people who taught me islam which seems good and sound therefore im 95 sure that becoming a suicide bomber is the right thing to do
669561 when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak
669562 go out and evangelize faith is taking a chance when you are less than 100 sure
669563 the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him
669564 ive made the decision to stand down as england captain
669565 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
669566 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
669567 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
669568 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
669569 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
669570 i will take a break from the game so i wont be playing at the oval
669571 i just want to try and freshen up the mind and get back to playing as a batsman i do believe these could be the best years of my playing career
669572 thats the one thing i want to get back doing
669573 in new zealand i had a few thoughts that i might go
669574 it is a fairytale to captain your country but it hasnt had a fairytale ending i know that it is the right time because my mind told me it was my body is working well but my mind is not
669575 i wish whoever gets the job all the luck in the world its a great privilege
669576 michael led from the front and led with honesty and integrity every step of the way
669577 he took the england captaincy to new heights michael was the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the character he instilled in the dressing room
669578 paul feels this is the best decision in terms of benefiting the england team and his contribution to the team
669579 we are extremely grateful for way paul led the one day side since last year
669580 the selection committee is currently considering the squad and captain for the fourth test and natwest series these squads along with the captain will be announced tomorrow monday
669581 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket
669582 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game
669583 i feel the england captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team
669584 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
669585 the last thing i want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the team which is why ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration
669586 i will continue to make myself available to england for all forms of cricket and look forward to playing a significant role in englands future success

669596 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
669597 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
669598 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness
669599 love between a married couple expressed in sex brings the human body closer to heaven the ecstasy in the joy of sexual intercourse can be likened to the joy of eternal life
669600 this is why the conjugal act allows spouses to begin to understand the sweetness of encountering god
669601 concentration on the physiological side of a sexual intercourse causes reduction of its most important elements
669602 when a woman is excited she wants to experience absolute pleasure as much as a man does
669603 the feeling of sexual dissatisfaction for a woman who is already excited is a great physical and psychological suffering
669604 i look at it this way you dont have to have a heart condition to be a cardiologist and you dont have to be an alcoholic to work as a therapist
669605 the holy fathers theology of the body and other philosophical and theological works delve deeply into the divinity of sexual relations in marriage im just making these complex ideas more accessible to average catholics
669606 the workshops with father knotz really helped us to overcome our inhibitions and guilt regarding sex
669607 he really listens to couples and this is why i think he understands us so well
669608 its a novel approach which in my experience helps couples achieve greater intimacy so why not
669609 no no no i dont hate you id love to drop kick ya though
669610 i am allergic to many skin lotions and dont want to risk a reaction
669611 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all

669614 sarkozy cest le seul qui a t oblig de passer par lelys e pour devenir premier ministre
669615 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
669616 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
669617 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
669618 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
669619 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two
669620 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
669621 no civilization can survive the physical destruction of its resource base
669622 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
669623 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
669624 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack
669625 one of our central tasks is the creation of the post oil megacity
669626 we are keen to hear to hear from anyone who may have seen anyone leaving the block around this time or any vehicle arriving or departing
669627 we also ask anyone who may have heard or seen a disturbance at the address to come forward
669628 the use of stolen content had become so pervasive that i couldnt surf the adult internet without running into stolen copies of our images
669629 not only did this really put a damper on my late night porn surfing but it upset me to no end instead of enjoying adult entertainment i started using those late night hours to document thieves
669630 the crowds that came out had clear disdain for america
669631 get off youre a black people its time to get out the vote paint the white house black and im sure thats got em terrified mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed
669632 i know jay z i know ludacris i know russell simmons i know a bunch of these guys they are great talents and great businessmen which is something that doesnt get emphasized enough it would be nice if i could have my daughters listen to their music without me worrying that they were getting bad images of themselves
669633 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
669634 this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics

669661 a lot of issues that have long confronted low wage workers are now increasingly facing middle income workers
669662 i dont think we want to live in a country where people are working and doing what they are supposed to do but yet they cant get the basics
669663 our company doesnt provide medical insurance i have to provide my own and i cannot find any that i can afford
669664 as far as having a full blown checkup i have not had one in probably 10 to 15 years
669665 weve had to cut back on things like going out to eat and shopping to make sure we have the necessities
669666 we feel okay but you have to worry more than you used to
669667 i might have to be forced to move back to texas
669668 because i wont be able to afford to live in florida
669669 i always say that the lord doesnt give you more than you can handle
669670 i make a decent amount but i dont make enough to support our family
669671 the babys on wic the federal women infants and children program so we can afford our formula if i had to pay for everything wed barely be making it if we were making it at all
669672 its still attainable just a little bit harder now at this time in the economy
669673 but yeah everybody wants to be able to have their own house and family and be able to pay their bills and have a little extra money and you can still do it
669674 if those growing concerns translate into political action to bolster the social safety net she said it would disproportionately help low wage workers

669704 but when the anthrax attack did come the remarkable thing was that it was never spun as a wmd attack on america an assertion which in the heated atmosphere following the attacks might actually have gained currency instead the fbi went almost direct to the lone american theory rather than impute the attacks on al qaeda if the bush administration had in fact planned to use the anthrax attacks to frame someone the lone american theory was precisely the wrong way to go about it

669716 in 2006 the two met privately in chicago apparently to discuss aids awareness
669717 the lesson for barack obama is be careful who your friends are
669718 obama seems to be in now comes the hard part convincing americans that he is the best choice for president without all hell breaking loose on the race front obamas second dilemma is convincing skeptical white voters that he and his wife are sympathetic to their concerns lets be honest few white americans would tolerate a reverend wright for five minutes much less 20 years

669731 we have known for some time that when certain magnetic materials are exposed to a magnetic field they lengthen or contract slightly however we still don t have a detailed understanding
669732 this new technique uses x rays to look at the movement of atoms with unprecedented resolution 100 times better than ever achieved before
669733 once we can look at atom positions in this way we will get a much better idea about the atomic structures of a range of materials meaning that we will be able refine our understanding of how structures and materials are made up this should lead to improvements in a wide range of technologies in the future
669734 to improve a technique by two orders of magnitude means that phenomena can now be investigated which produce subtle changes in the local atomic environment
669735 were brutalized humiliated dehumanized and subjected to the indignity of being stripped of their names and heritage
669736 native americans suffered and or are suffering worse and should be apologized to first

669744 as far as going back to africa yeah ok build america up and thank you and see you later were already far enough behind
669745 this is coming from folks who deep down in their heart they feel slavery was justified to get them to where theyre comfortable and we need to just stop complaining
669746 only in america can you get something for nothing and demand more
669747 i would end the war tomorrow to preserve the union even if it meant keeping slavery
669748 were brutalized humiliated dehumanized and subjected to the indignity of being stripped of their names and heritage

669751 as a harvard educated african american male most likely more educated than most of the posters here today
669752 most likely more educated than most of the posters here today
669753 its patently obvious from the devastating ignorance shown in the vast majority of the posts here that racism is not only alive and well its fundamentally ingrained within most caucasians
669754 kid down in purchasing department who thinks i am going to go all cougar on him every time i have to speak to him about a work issue
669755 then when we rid ourselves of prejudice or racial feeling and look facts in the face we must acknowledge that notwithstanding the cruelty and moral wrong of slavery the ten million negroes inhabiting this country who themselves or whose ancestors went through the school of american slavery are in a stronger and more hopeful condition materially intellectually morally and religiously than is true of an equal number of black people in any other portion of the globe
669756 hate baiting provoking and absurd generalizations i think that big meat 41 finds inflammatory
669757 jim crow ism as well as past slavery which the government took upon itself to derive again not blacks of american citizenship
669758 the african american male is the standard of physical achievement the greatest sportsmen of the day are african american white women prefer the masculinity and fertility of the african american male because the white male has shrunk in potency
669759 generally slaves were obtained through coastal trading with africans though some were captured by european slave traders through raids and kidnapping
669760 a number of african kings and merchants took part in the trading of slaves from 1440 to about 1900 for each captive the african rulers would receive a variety of goods from europe a number of african kings and merchants took part in the trading of slaves from 1440 to about 1900 for each captive the african rulers would receive a variety of goods from europe
669761 europeans usually bought slaves who were captured in tribal wars between african kingdoms and chiefdoms or from africans who had made a business out of capturing other africans and selling them
669762 what does it matter that slaves were sold by their own people
669763 does this justify the treatment endured by generations of african americans
669764 why should there need to be an apology this happened a long time ago
669765 what does it matter that slaves were sold by their own people
669766 america is bad other countries dont like us were the world bullies etc etc etc
669767 judging a person by the content of his character not the color of his skin
669768 welcome to america oh and by the way you were responsible for the enslavement of people hundreds of years back in a continent on the other side of the globe you are currently part of the problem because you are obviously a caucasian and all caucasians have it way better than dark skinned americans what your parents lived on potatoes and were discriminated against when they arrived ten years ago doesnt count because youre white
669769 generally slaves were obtained through coastal trading with africans though some were captured by european slave traders through raids and kidnapping

669771 europeans usually bought slaves who were captured in tribal wars between african kingdoms and chiefdoms or from africans who had made a business out of capturing other africans and selling them
669772 there were over 173 city states and kingdoms in the african regions affected by the slave trade between 1502 and 1853 when brazil became the last atlantic import nation to outlaw the slave trade
669773 if you were stolen from your homeland forced to forget everything that you held dear including your culture your language your religion your family your values and your traditions and forced to learn everything over again that was alien to you in addition to possibly seeing your brother or father beaten or killed and your mother or sister raped on a constant basis can you honestly tell yourself that after all that you could get back to business as if nothing ever happened
669774 in addition to possibly seeing your brother or father beaten or killed and your mother or sister raped on a constant basis can you honestly tell yourself that after all that you could get back to business as if nothing ever happened can you honestly tell yourself that there would be no future consequences whatsoever from the atrocities that were experienced if you can then i feel sorry for you
669775 this apology needs to be made by southern bible thumping republicans
669776 proud to be a black owned black run buisness we only hire black employees to serve you
669777 i personally dont care whether a person is green yellow blue red black white or orange
669778 please tell me why it is ok that we have
669779 but its hard to when you are a first generation of ongoing mental oppression if theyd just give us enough for a fair start at life then it could be up to us if we do anything with it but when you have so many things wrong from corrupt police wrongful laws oppressed parents wrongful jail convictions aids rates impossible school funding etc its hard to steer straight
669780 this is total bs show me just one person alive today that was directly impacted by slavery and then perhaps ill support some modicum of apology but to use slavery as an excuse for being lazy is just plain pathetic
669781 this happened over 200 years ago before i was a twinkle in anyones eye reparation heck the federal courts already handed them affirmative action why should i have to pay for the sins of the past
669782 still suffering the effects of slavery and jim crow laws
669783 apologizes to african americans on behalf of the people of the united states for the wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and jim crow
669784 he has sought to reach out to his black constituents and early in his term showed interest in joining the congressional black caucus until learning that was against caucus rules give me a freaken break
669785 cohen faces a formidable black challenger in a primary face off next week
669786 lastly for all of you who have had hard working white ancestors that did not own slaves you are still fairly ignorant if you think their and your skin color did does not provide any inherent advantages as a rather successful professional i have seen too many white subordiantes peers and superiors that are flat out incompetant or marginal at best
669787 no one is saying that todays white americans that didnt participate are responsible for the sins of slavery and jim crowe
669788 there is a large amount of ignorant insensitive racist white people that wouldnt give two craps if this country reverted back to the 18 and early 1900s
669789 any black person with even an ounce of ambition can walk to the front of the line of any college or corporation in this country
669790 any black person with even an ounce of ambition can walk to the front of the line of any college or corporation in this country the corporation i work for has its own board of directors whose single mission is the hiring and promotion of blacks our company has stated that it wants to be the 1 choice of african americans for employment this is called affirmative action if this were done for white folks is would be called discrimination
669791 i can tell a somewhat sad but funny story about an event that occured in my life recently
669792 but still it was such belittling view that even prompted this scenario
669793 the house on tuesday issued an unprecedented apology to black americans for the wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and jim crow segregation laws
669794 im sorry that my dead relatives were jerks to your dead relatives
669795 the u s did not have any slaves the confederate states did
669796 africans could have gone home when they got their freedom but they chose to stay in america
669797 i am isaiah washington and i was fired because i am black
669798 hate baiting justifications bigoted rationales and garrision of other provoking
669799 the education system is not allowed to hold students accountable
669800 we believe that this kind of political affiliation restricts the development of students into holistic first class human capital
669801 the rational is simple by joining political parties students will have to subscribe to a partys ideology and policies
669802 so if a student chooses to join a political party he or she will have to adhere to the policies advocated by the partys leaders and will not be allowed to offer opinions on issues raised independently
669803 this is a waste of talent and not beneficial to students who should seek to learn the most during this period of life
669804 in fact under this amendment we allow members of the opposition party to be invited to and participate in any intellectual discourse at public universities
669805 the members of the council had tabled their views rationally to find solutions to issues and challenges related to the society and nation
669806 a non confrontational approach which discusses issues rationally should be the basis for all malaysian student movements

669813 any attempt to take dna samples outside a police station is clearly unworkable
669814 while the increase of suspects on the database will lead to an increased cost this should be considered as preferable to letting a serious offender walk from custody
669815 the database provides police with on average over 3 500 matches each month and in 2005 6 alone led to matches against 422 homicides 645 rapes 1 974 other violent crimes and over 9 000 domestic burglaries
669816 the consultation is about maximising police efficiency and ensuring that appropriate and effective safeguards are in place no decisions have yet been made and any detailed proposals will be subject to a further public consultation next year
669817 this research grant will enable a diverse team of specialists from across the country to bring together knowledge of the nervous system and the latest developments in robotics to create robots that have behaviours able to match those of humans
669818 essentially we anticipate that the robots will be able to process sensory information from their surroundings in the same way that the human nervous system does and based on that information decide how to act for example the new breed of robots will be able to notice any sudden change in their surroundings such as something appearing in the periphery of its vision and will make an almost instantaneous decision as to whether the change warrants any action
669819 robots that can interpret and respond to their surroundings could in the future be used to construct devices to aid people with disabilities or to help in hostile environments such as deep oceans or space

669829 i fully support the university of sheffields plans to improve its student accommodation as someone who lived in broomhill for over ten years i have a great deal of affection for sheffield and love to see it thrive
669830 over the years the university has been one of sheffields greatest assets
669831 for these reasons the university plays an extremely important role in ensuring that sheffield continues to flourish and it is therefore essential that it keeps attracting top students to the city i am confident that the student residences strategy will help to do this and as a result sheffield as a whole will benefit
669832 it gives me great pleasure to learn that the student residences strategy has won the backing of tony christie i am proud that such an eminent local personality has chosen to support our plans

669840 hsbc and the university of sheffield are two of the biggest employers in sheffield both organisations feel it is important to encourage their staff
669841 sheffield like all big cities has a number of small green areas that are under threat from pollution neglect and vandalism with funding provided by hsbc and earthwatch and the vast number of students who are willing to give up their time to help such causes we hope to be able to preserve at least some of these areas for the local community and wildlife alike
669842 i would like to say a huge thank you to all those who took part the money will go towards new portable equipment and funding for specialist staff meaning more sheffield children with speech and language difficulties can be identified and helped
669843 we have raised 22 000 so far but the money is still coming in and the figure is set to rise over the next few weeks this money will also help us to support the communication and literacy needs of many local children through training staff and carers working with them
669844 this was an incredible challenge that was taken up so enthusiastically by staff students and alumni alike the crew had to endure early mornings choppy waters and seasickness along the way everyone involved has agreed that it was a fantastic experience we are delighted to have raised so much money and with gift aid we expect to exceed our target of 25 000
669845 this festival will give theatre goers in sheffield the chance to see both new writing and classic texts being interpreted and performed by members of the universitys school of english local school children will also take part in theatre in education programmes during the daytime students and staff alike have devoted time and creative energy to ensure that the centenary drama festival offers accessible enjoyable and thought provoking performances for everyone
669846 the facilities at the university s sport centre are second to none most of the schools that are attending have little or no outdoor space or facilities so we are delighted to be able to give them this fantastic opportunity
669847 we aim to show that every child whatever their ability can do well and have fun whilst learning new skills the student volunteers provide lots of noisy encouragement and make sure each child has a chance to shine
669848 writing steel city scholars has been an enormous and fascinating project which has involved collecting and collating the memories of hundreds of staff and former students of the university it covers all aspects of the universitys academic social and administrative development from 1905 when it had 114 full time students to today when it has over 18 000
669849 this event will give members of the public in sheffield a rare opportunity to see some of the wide range of treasures that the university has amassed in the past 100 years for example there will be zoological curiosities from the alfred denny collection as well as posters and photographs from the national fairground archive and our university a newly commissioned painting by joe scarborough which depicts the university of sheffield past and present

669852 in the 1750s londons perilous streets were run by armed gangs corrupt night watchmen and thief takers then two westminster magistrates novelist henry fielding and his brother john obtained a grant from parliament allowing them to bring some law and order to the crime ridden boroughs of central london seventy five years before the metropolitan police force was created these two brothers hired a small team in an attempt to bring law and order to the crime riddled boroughs of central london the team were the now infamous bow street runners
669853 it suddenly turned the area into a carnage scattering body parts of the street cleaners into a large area
669854 there were pools of blood everywhere i have never seen such mass killing
669855 a generation shaped by vietnam must remember the lessons of vietnam when america uses force in the world
669856 our hr strategy includes the aim of increasing the number of women in senior posts and in science and this event was designed to further this strategic aim by holding its first ever women s week the university of sheffield has confirmed its commitment to bringing issues facing women at work centre stage for discussion reflection and action we timed this event to coincide with the university s centenary year and have therefore been able to celebrate the achievements of women over the last 100 years
669857 the feedback received from staff for all the women s week events has been extremely positive women do still face barriers in the workplace and we must put in place constructive and creative interventions to overcome these
669858 we are fighting them over there so we wont be fighting them here

669861 alphastatin is a peptide found in a fragment of fibrinogen a protein that helps blood to clot
669862 the next step is to shrink alphastatin so that it could be administered in a tablet form and absorbed through the stomach
669863 it is tremendous to have won such a prestigious award and to work on a project that has the potential to be developed into a life saving new drug
669864 the practice faces increased challenges owing to the annual intake of approximately 6 500 new patients each september as a student practice with a mobile phone savvy patient population we considered text messages as the most efficient and cost effective option
669865 the decision to move to sms texting has met our expectations in many ways patients have been relieved of the responsibility to phone in and staff now have free time to deal with patient queries to be also recognised for the success of the service in the e health innovations awards is fantastic news for the university s health service
669866 alaska has a well established cruise ship industry while the industry in prince rupert is still in its infancy the research aims to highlight the perceptions and effects of the tourism industry on the two different communities
669867 i also have a personal interest in the project as i will be studying in my home city this scholarship provides me with an excellent opportunity to raise the profile of prince rupert s growing tourism industry at an international level
669868 we are delighted to award the scholarship to devin there has been little research undertaken in this topic therefore this is a good opportunity to explore the subject in more depth the research is a requirement of devin s master of arts dissertation and we are looking forward to seeing the results
669869 we found that in both patients who are admitted and discharged there is a sudden leap in the number of patients dealt with between 220 and 240 minutes
669870 whilst there is no doubt that time spent in a amp e departments has improved over the past two years and i am certain that staff in a amp e departments are working hard to improve patient care i think this study raises questions as to whether time targets are the most effective way of achieving this perhaps time could be used as one target alongside others that represent an improvement in the patient experience
669871 this study certainly raises a number of questions about how time targets contribute to the quality of patient care and further research is essential
669872 we are delighted to welcome joe scarborough to our annual dinner this week where our university will be formally presented to vice chancellor bob boucher and the attendant officers and members of the sua
669873 the painting will be a wonderful addition to the university of sheffields campus and we are thrilled to involve such a prominent local artist in the suas celebrations of the universitys centenary year
669874 asylum seekers and refugees are often not able to participate in sports due to lack of money and opportunity football is a global sport which helps bring together refugees with their local communities breaking down barriers and furthering integration
669875 many of our students knew little or nothing about their local refugee community before the football for friendship events started the initiative is a fantastic opportunity for the two communities to unite
669876 face recognition is remarkable in that it is a cognitive development that actually involves a loss of ability
669877 our experiment aimed to discover whether this tuning in effect was due to babies being exposed to human faces more often than to other species or whether it is something that happens over time regardless of environment
669878 the babies in our experiment were shown pictures of monkeys for one to two minutes every day between the ages of six and nine months the control group weren t shown the pictures
669879 at nine months of age the babies returned and completed a face recognition task
669880 people with electric toothbrushes that don t have rotating oscillating heads shouldn t worry as it won t be doing them any harm
669881 chemistry is fundamental to the health of the economy of the uk in general and to the local region in particular it is a practical subject and it is very important that pupils have an opportunity to see it in action rather than just in abstract this event aims to show chemistry in an exciting and interesting way to demonstrate the link between the subject and excellent career opportunities and to encourage pupils to consider a career in the chemical sciences
669882 chemistry at work events offer school students the opportunity to appreciate the place of chemistry in everyday life and the world of work with particular emphasis on what is happening in their local area we are delighted to be able to support the event in south yorkshire
669883 this will be a fantastic opportunity for people to hear brand new music that has been written in sheffield the audience will be able to really get a feel for the cutting edge composition that is coming out of the city and people who do not think of themselves as classical music fans could be surprised by the different sounds and strange sights in firth hall on the night
669884 im really looking forward to hearing and seeing the first ever performance of my piece incorporating both music and movement its great to be able to experiment in this way thanks to the wonderful skills of the universitys talented performers and i hope that the audience will be as excited as i am by the wealth of new music talent coming out of the university of sheffield and the city as a whole
669885 im delighted that the ambassador is coming to sheffield to officially mark the integration of the peter king collection into our library the new books are a great boost to students and academics interested in dutch culture literature and language in sheffield
669886 the ambassadors visit reinforces sheffields place at the forefront of dutch studies in the uk as will the soon to be established research centre for dutch studies which will help to increase sheffields capacity to teach and research the rich culture history art literature and language of the low countries
669887 the uk has become more public sector dependent since 1997 from a competitiveness and long term economic perspective this is worrying since it is the private sector that is the engine of growth and development
669888 unless this imbalance is rectified the uk will fall further down the global competitiveness league in coming years with regions which are already struggling to compete becoming increasingly beleaguered
669889 in effect our research findings suggest that the economic disparities which existed in 1997 remain largely in place without a significant move to develop levels of entrepreneurship and business building in the uk the disparities will continue to undermine the economic competitiveness of the nation
669890 normal cells replicate by dividing dna into two strands and copying each strand
669891 the new treatment uses a chemical that prevents parp from repairing the dna making recombination essential the breast cancer tumour cannot perform recombination and is therefore unable to replicate and create new cells the tumour is then unable to grow and eventually dies
669892 the beauty of this system is that only the tumour cells lack brca genes and thus only they completely rely on parp the other cells in the body are likely to be unaffected by the treatment and continue to use recombination to repair any mistakes that occur
669893 this treatment is a new concept in cancer therapy and could lead to revolutionary new treatments for women with hereditary breast cancer within the next few years
669894 over the years we have developed and maintained close links with the czech embassy we are delighted that the ambassador has expressed an interest in visiting the university our relationship with the previous ambassador was extremely successful and we are looking forward to continuing this with his successor
669895 key to the universitys contribution to the citys economy is its ability to attract retain and grow its student base this project will considerably enhance the universitys attractiveness and enhance even more the positive experience the students will have in sheffield
669896 i am delighted with the support that has been shown for the student residences strategy especially from business leaders within sheffield the project will not only benefit the university itself but the city as a whole
669897 we value the views of the business community as we do those of local residents and all others who are taking an interest in our plans
669898 i understand that react a local pressure group is holding a public meeting regarding our plans this evening it is unfortunate that representatives from the university of sheffield were not invited to actively participate at this meeting
669899 the university remains committed to wide ranging public consultation on our student residences strategy and i have every confidence that this process will continue to bring about positive developments in the future
669900 were delighted to welcome such a high profile speaker to the second managing directors club dinner meeting of 2005 our meetings give local business leaders a unique opportunity to forge new links with the university of sheffield and we expect that lord bests contribution to this meeting will ensure that it is an enjoyable and thought provoking night for all our members
669901 the university is seeking to recognise outstanding achievements by unsung heroes whose efforts and contributions to society would not normally be publicly recognised
669902 we are looking for friends family and members of the community to come forward with names of people who they believe deserve recognition for their contributions and achievements
669903 the university s success over the past 100 years would not have been possible without the help and support of staff students and local residents therefore we want everyone in the community to share in our celebrations
669904 i m delighted that the university of sheffield has been recognised as a centre for best practice in the efficient use of water water is a semi scarce resource so minimising its use around the university is a priority for us as an environmentally conscious organisation
669905 having worked as a detective i am fascinated by the idea of solving a crime which has mystified the police and the british public for over a century my talk at the university will give people in sheffield the opportunity to find out more about the fascinating ripper murders and the new breakthroughs that can help to solve unsolvable cases of the past
669906 this voyage will enable nigel and i and the rest of the team to see some of europes most beautiful coastline from the fantastic setting of a traditional square rigged tall ship we expect the voyage to be a real challenge but weve been overwhelmed by peoples generosity and sponsorship so im sure that well all have great fun whilst raising money for a deserving cause
669907 its fantastic that this sailing team is raising money through the universitys centenary year celebrations for the work we do with children with speech difficulties
669908 the money raised by this incredible challenge will also help us to raise awareness of the impact of speech difficulties on childrens lives in particular their literacy and social development the links with dyslexia and the need for further training of professionals and carers i wish all 48 crew members the best of luck with their adventure
669909 were delighted that this challenge has been taken up so enthusiastically by staff students and alumni alike as part of the universitys centenary celebrations this once in a lifetime trip promises to be a fundraising celebration to remember
669910 i am delighted we have appointed bovis lend lease to work in partnership with the university to deliver this important project they have a superb track record of delivering and operating projects of this nature this is an important step for this exciting scheme it will offer excellent value for money for students providing excellent accommodation at a competitive rent
669911 the bio incubator is an important step in creating a cluster of high tech bioscience business and expertise in the region we are delighted to be able to contribute to the region in this way and to be able to offer these world class facilities to start up companies
669912 i am thrilled to be involved with this project and to have the honour of officially topping out the building the bio incubator should really kick start the region s bioscience cluster
669913 kier northern is delighted to have been given responsibility for the construction of the bioscience building its first project for sheffield university and we look forward to continuing the excellent working relationship established on this scheme in the future
669914 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
669915 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
669916 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
669917 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
669918 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
669919 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
669920 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
669921 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
669922 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
669923 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
669924 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
669925 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
669926 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
669927 im delighted that the work of dr hart and the other serg team members involved has been internationally recognised through this award we are pleased that sheffield is becoming increasingly renowned for excellence in developing sporting technology and the serg team hope to continue to be at the forefront of elite sport engineering in the uk

669929 a student benefiting fully under all three schemes will receive 3 000 in cash each year in addition to higher education grants of 2700 each year
669930 these bursaries represent a real improvement for students from low income households who will now not have to pay any tuition fees upfront and will also benefit from bursaries towards their living expenses which in sheffield are particularly competitive
669931 the university of sheffield has a strong track record in widening participation for students who would not traditionally come to university we believe that the students should be recruited on their intelligence and academic ability not on their ability to pay
669932 if you watched him onboard on his last stint you could see he was pushing as hard as he could he was thanks stge made a typo in my database have updated now and fixed mclarens total too first of all i tipped kovi to win agree generally with throttle any win in f1 is hard to achieve
669933 lors de lentretien qui sest d roul entre raul castro dune part nikola patrouchev et igor setchine de lautre il a t soulign que les gouvernements de la russie et de cuba entendent d ployer des efforts cons quents en vue de r tablir leurs liens traditionnels dans tous les domaines de la coop ration de les largir et approfondir sous tous les aspects
669934 successful suggestion schemes are carefully planned continually publicised supported by top management and involve giving feedback to employees on their suggestions
669935 unfortunately fewer than twenty per cent of the companies i surveyed reported schemes with all of these characteristics which suggests that most companies arent getting the most out of their suggestion schemes
669936 we found that suggestion schemes have a greater effect on creativity than even job design
669937 last summer we drew up a master plan for our endcliffe and ranmoor sites as a key element of our student residences strategy
669938 a great deal of effort has been put in both by the university and residents groups in working together to find solutions that are beneficial to all concerned
669939 our revised plans represent the outcomes of genuine broad based consultation and i am very proud of the proposals that we will are now taking forward to the council
669940 the university will now concentrate on preparing a comprehensive management plan for the development which will encompass a broad range of issues many of which are of direct interest to local residents
669941 whilst these matters may not be concerned with the planning process the university is keen to ensure that local people are not only heard but are at the forefront of our consideration when drafting the plan
669942 we look forward to continuing to work with local people in order to address many of the social and environmental challenges that the university and sheffields residential communities share
669943 friends and foes the unseen bugs who share our planet
669944 i am delighted to be welcomed back to my alma mater to name such a wonderful facility chemistry is essential to all branches of science and to learning more about the world in which we live i am thrilled that the university of sheffield is investing in chemistry and am certain that this facility will help shape the careers of some of the finest scientific minds of the future
669945 it is an honour to welcome dr roberts back to sheffield to open the building which will allow us to further develop the world class teaching and research for which the department is well known
669946 the university has an excellent reputation for the quality of its nanotechnology research as one of the leading institutes in the subject we were keen to produce a textbook which would be a valuable tool for students on our postgraduate programme
669947 the textbook is also ideal for nanotechnology researchers and final year science and engineering undergraduates who are taking a nanoscience option
669948 tomography is a way of seeing inside a fast moving chemical process doctors use similar techniques in the form of a cat scanner to see inside people and observe any malfunction it is also ideal for detecting foreign objects like glass stones or splinters of wood in processed foods
669949 the results of this kind of technology are communicated as visual art forms therefore engineers can learn a great deal from the thought processes of artists
669950 over the years the disciplines of art and engineering have grown apart from each other however it is important to remember that most universities originated as mining and arts schools i hope that this lecture will encourage people to see that there is a new and exciting opportunity for scientists and artists to integrate and work together the lecture engineering images a fusion of engineering and art
669951 this meeting will enable scientists at the forefront of nuclear waste management research to demonstrate the moves that are being taken to ensure that britain has safe and effective measures to deal with radioactive waste
669952 im delighted to be able to share the results of our research with a national political audience
669953 the scans were conducting in sheffield suggest that certain areas of the human brain become active when a person tells a lie also the preliminary results of our research show that a person telling a lie takes on average 200 milliseconds longer to answer a question than a person telling the truth the implications of this research are far reaching particularly in terms of possible future applications in the judicial system for instance if it were to become possible to identify definitively when someone was telling a lie it would become far easier to prevent miscarriages of justice
669954 both greater manchester and thames gateway have a challenging range of problems regeneration has the potential to improve not only the quality of life and economic prospects for these areas but also to provide knock on effects for the wider region
669955 by the end of the project we hope to have established best environmental practice in brownfield development and created international benchmarks for those who will be making policy decisions in the future
669956 environmental systems that man depends on like the water cycle rely heavily on the biodiversity of the natural world when species disappear from the earth through extinction and the biodiversity of our planet is altered the effect on systems we take for granted can be immense
669957 for instance the extinction of pollinator species may in effect directly lower agricultural yields as it is the biodiversity of the natural world which balances and regulates many of the natural services upon which society depends
669958 we hope that these seminars will be the start of an ongoing partnership with brinsworth school which will encourage more young people from the rotherham area to continue their education post 18
669959 as a university lecturer it is incredibly important for me to get out into schools in the south yorkshire community and to find out more about how young people are being taught at a level as a lecturer i hope to learn a great deal from the teachers at brinsworth school and hope that their students will be inspired to study english at a higher level when they leave school
669960 we are delighted to welcome such a high profile speaker from the national press to the university of sheffield in our centenary year alan rusbridgers lecture promises to give an entertaining and fascinating insight into our national press
669961 this year the just do it campaign is bigger and better than ever before as part of the university s centenary celebrations over 100 students will take part in this year s event
669962 our student volunteers make an active contribution to the community that they themselves are now part of since its launch in march 2003 the just do it programme has involved four events incorporating a total of 40 tasks and benefiting 28 different local community and voluntary organisations
669963 this event gives all students at the university the opportunity to get involved with performance and production or simply the chance to take part as audience members
669964 it is a fantastic challenge and great fun for everyone who takes part
669965 we are delighted to be able to celebrate our centenary year with one of our partner institutions in the wun and to celebrate pennsylvania state universitys 150th birthday
669966 enjoyable artistic events such as these are a great way to build closer relationships between wun institutions and we look forward to extending a warm welcome to the artists and the president of pennsylvania state university
669967 this show will give fans of pratchetts fiction the chance to see their favourite characters come to life on the stage the special matinee performance on saturday 12 march will give enthusiasts young and old alike the chance to take part in the show by coming dressed as their favourite characters for people unfamiliar with pratchetts books the show will be an action packed fun filled night out people of all ages
669968 the purpose of the sheffield malaysian games 2005 is to contribute to building a peaceful and better world by educating youth through sport it is also a place where students from similar roots or backgrounds can meet up and exchange views regarding studies or life in the uk for those who are not interested in sports this event is a great chance to meet old and new friends from around the country
669969 less than one per cent of the neurons in the brain use dopamine as a neurotransmitter but any change in its levels can have devastating effects too much dopamine can lead to schizophrenia whereas not enough causes parkinson s disease drug addicts also have a malfunction in their dopamine systems so learning more about the way this chemical works could lead to better treatments for a range of conditions
669970 the dominant theory in the field suggested that the dopamine message carries information specifically about reward brain systems involved in reward fulfil a vital function in that they underpin the motivation to seek out food water and all of the other things that we need to survive and play a central role in learning we tend to do more of the things that lead to nice outcomes that is we learn to according to the effect that our actions have
669971 much of the previous work concerning dopamine and reward has used visual stimuli so our team focused on the visual responsiveness of dopamine cells and rather than decoding the dopamine message itself we looked at the message that the dopamine cells were being given by other bits of the brain to pass on
669972 we found that the visual information that the dopamine message carries is provided by the superior colliculus which is one of the oldest parts of the visual system in terms of evolution the colliculus is the brain s burglar alarm and hence the visual response properties of its cells are fairly primitive we concluded that it is unlikely that such a visually primitive structure would be allowed by evolution to provide the sensory input to a system which was involved in something as vital as reward instead we propose that as a burglar alarm the colliculus provides information to dopamine cells about the occurrence of biologically important stimuli which then pass this salience based signal to other brain areas in other words the remit of the dopamine message goes beyond reward to include all stimuli which are pertinent to the animal s survival
669973 stem cell therapy is a relatively new area and it is important that people are able to hear both sides of the argument before making a decision about the ethics of this type of science this event will allow us to put forward both points of view and to address peoples fears and concerns in an open environment
669974 the fair is open to all and is not purely for students and graduates this is an ideal occasion for anyone who is interested in a career in the public sector to find out more about graduate and professional opportunities
669975 the union of students and the university of sheffield are committed to raising awareness of the choices involved in buying fairly traded goods the number of different events taking place at the university throughout national fairtrade fortnight will enable all our students and staff to discover ways to support producers in the developing world on a daily basis

669994 many people only have a vague idea of what nanotechnology is these films will demonstrate how peoples lives are already being affected by nanotechnology and how in the future nanotechnology could if used in the right way bring major positive benefits
669995 the film at the science museum shows people in an accessible way how nanotechnology works and the benefits it can bring as an epsrc media fellow i am particularly interested in ensuring that science is communicated to as wide an audience as possible and this film is a great start in explaining this fascinating subject
669996 the marriage of science and design is an exciting collaboration the challenge for us was to visualise the subject but keeping the scientific integrity alive
669997 this seminar is another example of how the worlds leading aerospace companies are looking to sheffield to develop new technologies to move the industry forward in may we are hosting a conference for the institute of mechanical engineers and the centre along with the city is a world centre of excellence in materials and cutting technology
669998 im delighted to have worked alongside ice and local schools to bring this event to sheffield as a department we are keen to promote the idea of careers in engineering among our citys young people through fun days and competitions such as these we can help to develop a better understanding of and enthusiasm for careers in civil engineering
669999 this is a wonderful opportunity for south yorkshire business people to hear international speakers on a local stage it also gives them an opportunity to network and interact with the academic community
