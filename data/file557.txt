5570049 i have to go to the ordinance and look at how and why we can grant a variance
5570050 i do not feel at this time you have been able to meet the requirements
5570051 we have to follow section 25 17 we are legally bound to do that

5570053 he must have been through a lot of pressure from the press both the media and liu xiang himself should take the responsibility
5570054 in the end it really matters only to himself we are just the audience i am sure he is the one that regrets this the most we still like him as a person
5570055 there was such great expectation and great pressure on liu xiang for the last four years since he won gold in athens
5570056 he went into the stadium with the strongest will liu xiang would not have withdrawn unless the pain was intolerable and he had no other way out
5570057 it is unbelievable a chinese an asian has won this event it is a proud moment not only for china but for asia and all people who share the same yellow skin color

5570066 this replaces all that said taylor who ran a personal best 47
5570067 after eight years to win after everything ive gone through im so happy
5570068 i had the exact same score and thats what makes it a little bit harder to take said liukin who won the individual all around gold medal sunday
5570069 it wasnt that i lost by three or five tenths it was the same score unfortunately you cant control the judges after you land the dismount its all up to them
5570070 its not correct i believe its correct to have two gold medals
5570071 but these competitions dont belong to the fig they belong to the ioc
5570072 its not up to us we do our own thing
5570073 shes an excellent athlete no matter how old she is
5570074 shes done her hard work and her preparation she definitely deserved her gold medal its not like i did a perfect routine
5570075 scoring is scoring thats our sport in other sports like track and field its all timed and it doesnt have anything to do with judging or in basketball or baseball you can keep score our sport is subjective by nature weve come to accept the way it is

5570088 shes become an adjective friends will go shopping with each other and say its so madonna thats what you want in fashion
5570089 for one thing the kernel is quite complex and big and it inevitably simply takes time to learn all the rules not just for the code but for how the whole development environment works similarly for a new developer it will take time before people start recognizing the name and start trusting the developer to do the right things
5570090 we make it fairly easy for people to ease into kernel development
5570091 it seems to be working too we literally have thousands of people with patches attributed to them in each release
5570092 the worst thing anybody can do is to study the kernel alone and try to learn things in private and then however many months later present all the established kernel developers with a big patch that just comes out of the blue
5570093 it may not sound exciting but quite frankly i dont think anybody who starts out believing that they want to rewrite some big piece of the kernel should even bother reality isnt that simple
5570094 of course some people will be alienated and theres no doubt that the process could probably be improved
5570095 not a warm and fuzzy environment where people sing kumbaya around the fireplace
5570096 the kernel is about pretty harsh technical issues and mistakes are really frowned upon
5570097 in an os kernel there are simply more security and stability requirements and the bar is really higher in some respects that will inevitably also reflect in the response to patches
5570098 i think that one of the things weve been very good at is to scale up with a good network of maintainers so that most people involved actually dont work closely with more than a handful of people
5570099 normally the people you find at the core of open source projects are professional software engineers these guys know how to run software projects
5570100 its nothing i can control and honestly i can say it has been very fair to me and i got the biggest gold medal of them all
5570101 im a little sad but at the same time its great to have four olympic medals
5570102 highest in customer satisfaction with digital cameras 200 399 three years in a row
5570103 sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices and weaker growth in exports
5570104 the story of the edwards coverup which has only begun to trickle out is certainly providing a useful civic education in how powerful pols actually go about attempting to influence the msm
5570105 we do see people that have smaller incomes more single incomes rather than the double income because people are losing their jobs
5570106 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5570107 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5570108 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5570109 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there
5570110 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5570111 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5570112 i wish it was sort of true being on quidditch with him would be kind of cool
5570113 we say join the club it makes us feel old too
5570114 but if youve got a certain degree of wisdom and your body hasnt fallen apart yet you may be at the best time of your life
5570115 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5570116 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5570117 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5570118 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5570119 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5570120 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5570121 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5570122 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5570123 it gives me enormous pleasure to bring the boys are back to shoot in south australia thanks to the enthusiastic support of mike rann and the south australian film corporation
5570124 im looking forward to showing the splendour of the fleurieu to the wider world in the context of this powerful and emotional drama
5570125 we successfully lured the calf about a kilometre out to sea probably the first time thats been done using a yacht as a surrogate mother
5570126 later we saw whales a bit further offshore and there was a slender chance it may have linked up with them but this morning we have got reports that it has returned to the western shores of pittwater
5570127 weve consistently said it was a slim chance that it might link up with its mother or other whales but the reality is that in the wild for various reasons mothers sometimes reject their young
5570128 looking at its behaviour the way it was nuzzling up to yachts would indicate it was primarily still suckling
5570129 it really was trying to suckle just below the waterline and against the keel with its head engaged against the boat
5570130 the situation is moving in a positive manner the tension is now being cooled down
5570131 the situation has improved quite a lot in regards to the standoff between the militaries from both sides
5570132 the tension around the area has been eased we hope very much that the situation will go back to normal as soon as possible
5570133 if any money is left over we will donate it to a local charity
5570134 people will be speaking on the same order as they will appear on the ballot paper and most candidates will be staying after the formal questions are over so people can talk to them
5570135 we let it be known with the dodgers that was the one ballclub he had interest in going to that any deal we were going to do was going to be the best baseball deal we could do and it wasnt going to be a financial deal to try to move dollars we just werent happy with the prospect we would be getting back and we chose to hold onto him
5570136 although people have been charged there is still a lot of work to do and other lines of inquiry that need to be followed up
5570137 the investigators have made a significant stride and hopefully this dreadful case is coming to its conclusion
5570138 all i will say is that my client maintains his innocence
5570139 we were informed this morning of the news from antigua and we are pleased at how the investigation is progressing
5570140 but the nuttiness is not nearly as widespread in the us
5570141 men are the protectors and maintainers of women because allah has given the one more strength than the other and because they support them from their means therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient and guard in the husbands absence what allah would have them guard as to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill conduct admonish them first next refuse to share their beds and last beat them but if they return to obedience seek not against them means of annoyance for allah is most high great above you all
5570142 the board knows exactly the stance of the players the players have said what they had to say it is up to the board to make the decision i am sure everything is going to be looked at
5570143 he looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges that they face asked if musharrafs resignation would not have an impact on the us war on terror johndroe recalled a good meeting bush had with pakistani prime minister yousuf raza gilani a couple of weeks ago in washington and said were going to continue working with the government of pakistan the pakistanis realise that the threat of terrorism the threat of extremism is a threat to them as well as the rest of the world he said so were confident that while we certainly all have more to do when it comes to fighting terrorism the government of pakistan will continue in the effort earlier in the first us reaction us secretary of state condoleezza rice too expressed strong support for the new democratic government of pakistan as she expressed our deep gratitude to musharraf whom she described as a friend to the us and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism we strongly support the democratically elected civilian government in its desire to modernise pakistan and build democratic institutions she said striking a balance between a studiously hands off approach to the new pakistani governments move to impeach a key ally and the need to build bridges with the new government rice expressed our deep gratitude to musharraf while vowing to continue to work with the pakistani government and its political leaders but manifest in her statement was the us concern how the war on terror would shape up now that musharraf is gone president musharraf has been a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism she said meanwhile a leading us security expert karin von hippel said while musharrafs resignation signalled the end of a long and important relationship with the us she was hopeful that it will now evolve into a more positive relationship
5570144 by all criteria of modern molecular biology life is present from the moment of conception
5570145 it is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception
5570146 i have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception
5570147 to accept the fact that after fertilization has taken place a new human has come into being is no longer a matter of taste or opinion it is plain experimental evidence
5570148 but time makes it better we got a chance to say goodbye and share a lot of time together at the end i can look back on it now and be happy
5570149 i dont know why we lost that match that day all we think about now is win win win
5570150 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
5570151 googles figure is 149 billion and rising fast pushing the company past most of americas biggest most successful most respected corporations
5570152 in simplest terms search engine optimization seo is applying knowledge of how search engines work to make sites easier to find on the web for the audiences that those pages were intended to attract in more complicated terms seo is a matter of combining an application of marketing ideas and a knowledge of search engines to help bring the right people to a site so that they will change from visitor to consumer
5570153 in what ways is seo more effective or efficient than other online marketing methods
5570154 search engine optimization means being aware of how search engines might collect information from the pages of a website and making it easy for the search engines to index the content of those pages in effect it means enabling a search engine to become an index for the pages of a site it can be less expensive than using the paid contextual ads that you see displayed with search results at a search engine or the banner ads that show up on other websites that may point to the site advertised
5570155 do you think the power of seo is relatively undermined or in contrast do you think it is overplayed as an online marketing method in the industry
5570156 search is one of the commonest activities that people get involved in when the go online so making a website easy to be found in a search engine for people who might be looking for what that site has to offer is a good idea it can make sense to include seo as one part of a multiple part marketing effort and to build a strong marketing plan that includes both online and offline parts unfortunately there are differing skill sets amongst people who offer seo services some are just better than others
5570157 seo is only really important to sites that want to increase their visibility on the web a game clan site where everyone who needs to know the address of the site already does has no need for seo but if you hope to attract visitors to your pages it doesnt hurt to make them as search friendly as possible and if you want to attract people to those pages who might be interested in the content of the pages it doesnt hurt to try to use words on the pages that those people might try to search with on a search engine and to do it in a manner that makes it more likely that those words will be found earlier on in search results
5570158 is it possible for webmasters to with fundamental knowledge of html and blogging implement seo for themselves with relatively successful results for their small websites
5570159 webmasters with a fundamental knowledge of html and blogging can achieve some success with being found on the web but having a good knowledge of how search engines work can help a webmaster make better choices about how their site is set up for success with search engines
5570160 in general what is the timeline of results returned by seo
5570161 the amount of time that it may take to achieve results may vary by the site involved and how much work it might need the competitiveness of the market it is within and the demand for what the site offers its almost impossible to guarantee success generally and perhaps even harder to do it within a specified timeline
5570162 do you believe seo may become obsolete in the future
5570163 i dont see it becoming obsolete as much as i see it evolving what we considered seo in 1998 is different than what we consider it to be now if you look at a set of search results in google today you may see videos images news web pages product searches and other results that you wouldnt have seen even a couple of years ago the web is changing and search engines are changing and helping people so that they understand some of these changes and how they might impact their web sites will probably continue to be a need to be filled in the future
5570164 in what ways might seo be viable for businesses with niches
5570165 finding a niche where you can be competitive and where theres a demand from consumers can increase your likelihood of success a small business can often take advantage of working within a niche that a larger business might find to be too much work for too little return if the smaller business has considerably less overhead in terms of cost and time they may be able to thrive in one of those niches by focusing upon a specific market or audience that others arent it may be possible to be found easier if people want to find the service or goods or information that you provide within that niche
5570166 originality and innovation as a new theme and environment will provide the focus of each days shooting

5570176 statistics are like bikinis what they reveal is provocative what they conceal is vital
5570177 we are concerned that if this issue is not urgently addressed it is only a matter of time before there is an avoidable death of a client in one of our communities due to delay in transfer to hospital
5570178 the government still does not understand the urgency of the issue
5570179 we now say how many more deaths will occur not when will the next death occur
5570180 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5570181 it is not rocket science here we could actually move aboriginal people across into these jobs
5570182 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers we were the cotton chippers we did all this rural work we were the unskilled labourers in the rural industry
5570183 we created a false economy and then people got used to the idea of staying at home rather than actually going out and looking for work
5570184 in other words the requirements that we will put in place will ensure that if there is an australian or someone based in australia who is ready willing and able to work in the horticulture industry then theyll get the jobs first
5570185 were going to review that pilot program halfway through to see whether its a success to whether the requirements weve put in place are working effectively
5570186 and if it is successful to see whether it might be sensible to expand the capacity to other areas of australia or indeed to other countries in the pacific
5570187 yet for some inexplicable reason the labor party says the horticultural industry can have workers but the tourism industry cant
5570188 we need some clear and specific policy parameters before the opposition can determine whether or not we will support this
5570189 there are several industries we have looked at that are having labour shortage crisis issues and these are all industries that timor can gain skills from
5570190 what we have proposed is 300 employees and trainees in the first pilot year and we are also requesting 100 occupational trainees
5570191 timor would certainly benefit from the fact that we have such a large youth unemployed and unskilled so called bubble
5570192 these people guest workers certainly would assist in timors national and human security recovery and development
5570193 those of us who have forgone a fancy blackberry treo or iphone know a standard cell phone is probably the most non interactive un tweakable device in the gadget stable
5570194 el destino de las tierras de las comunidades nativas y campesinas pasa necesariamente por la decisi n voluntaria de los nativos y campesinos no hay nada que alguien pueda hacer que no pase por la voluntad de ellos
5570195 no hay ning n solo elemento en dicha norma que sea extra o ajeno y distinto a los propios comuneros todos los elementos de estas dos normas pasan por el ejercicio libre de la voluntad de los comuneros que nadie los enga e
5570196 consideramos que muy buena parte de lo que est ocurriendo se debe particularmente a una informaci n distorsionada hecha de una manera deliberada probablemente para hacer aparecer a esos decretos legislativos como armas letales contra los derechos de los comuneros y no hay nada m s alejado de la verdad eso es falso
5570197 i knew the united states didnt come in here as the favorites in the discus

5570200 i am not an expert on politics but i know a lot about leadership
5570201 the guidelines for choosing a leader our nation needs and that god blesses are based on biblical qualities found in proverbs
5570202 live with integrity serve with humility and share with generosity
5570203 today most leaders are interested in image what people think they are but true leadership involves integrity based on character and confidence which is the number one need for leaders in america
5570204 integrity doesnt mean perfection no one is perfect but it does mean being honest which leads to credibility and trust
5570205 true leaders are known by how they serve not how many serve them
5570206 too many leaders start out in service that quickly evolves into serve us
5570207 the worst sin one can have is pride which makes us enemies of god
5570208 humility is a declaration of dependence our president needs to be humble and we should look for leaders who admit their dependence on god
5570209 you can give without loving but you cant love without giving it is important that a leader give both his time and his money for others
5570210 america is one of the most blessed nations in the world and we need to be a blessing to others
5570211 in a leader you are looking for someone who will speak up for those who cant speak for themselves
5570212 the purpose of warrens sermon wasnt to tell his congregants how to vote but to provide them guidance from a biblical foundation in considering candidates for office not just the presidency but also senators congressman governors on down to electing local officials
5570213 first pray for the candidates for yourself and for wisdom
5570214 second check the candidates out not just their position on issues but also their character and competence third register to vote fourth and above all vote
5570215 if you are saying i dont like either candidate maybe i wont vote then i say you need to move to another country
5570216 because if you dont you are giving up a privilege which people died to make possible

5570241 methylene blue first discovered in 1891 is now used to treat methemoglobinemia a blood disorder but because high concentrations of methylene blue were known to damage the brain no one thought to experiment with low concentrations also drugs such as methylene blue do not easily reach the brain dr atamnas research is the first to show that low concentrations of the drug have the ability to slow cellular aging in cultured cells in the laboratory and in live mice he believes methylene blue has the potential to become another commonplace low cost treatment like aspirin prescribed as a blood thinner for people with heart disorders
5570242 long term solutions need to be carried out permanently to fix most of this problem that have exerbated over the years and we are in the process of doing that
5570243 i want to assure the people of nasinu that we are tending to their roads and we are doing our best we can within the limited resources we get
5570244 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5570245 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5570246 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5570247 im just glad theyre willing to let the past be the past and give him a chance i just hope that the cincinnati fans will give him the same type of chance

5570251 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state

5570254 on both touchdowns the offensive line did a great job of blocking and eli put the ball right where it needed to be
5570255 on the free kick the guys up front did a heckuva job blocking the wedge cleaned them out and gave me a seam to run and everybody else sealed off their blocks out front the tough job is the blocking all i had to do is run
5570256 our goal was to come out and play strong and get off to a better start than we did last week we did that
5570257 since the detroit game aug 7 getting my feet inbounds is something we have practiced
5570258 it is something i need to do better every day after practice we work on it i even talked to amani toomer and plax plaxico burress about how they get their feet down inbounds
5570259 the second possession we got the pass interference and then got a touchdown
5570260 the next time we got the ball we did a good job of getting another touchdown after getting good field position
5570261 he has taken snaps with the first team all training camp he has been making plays for us and his work paid off tonight he stayed in bounds for the first touchdown which was a fade route and then again on the second touchdown which was a post route
5570262 it was really a great job on both of them of getting his feet down then the touchdown on the free kick that gave him the hat trick in the first quarter not a bad night
5570263 our goal for the whole season is to come out and play well at home
5570264 last year we didnt play well at home its good to come out here and give a good performance

5570298 uruguay play aggressively and put pressure on their opponents so it will be good preparation for the match against bahrain in the first qualifier
5570299 ive been playing without thinking too much about returning to the national team ive done my best for bochum and it resulted in this return

5570301 these players are not only for the match against uruguay i need them also for the upcoming world cup qualifiers i want to test how they play
5570302 we wanted to win a medal in every relay and we achieved that we wanted to score the most medals that weve ever scored before and we achieved that
5570303 we also probably wanted to score the most gold medals of anybody but we didnt quite get there we were one short of athens and two short of melbourne but one more than sydney
5570304 we go home with a lot of our goals achieved but still room to improve and still places to go

5570331 if these financial institutions are allowed to deduct these payments from their taxable income that would amount to a tax windfall for these financial institutions that is paid for by us taxpayers
5570332 i understand that the securities and exchange commission sec is investigating whether citigroup and other financial institutions misled investors regarding the safety and liquidity of auction rate securities
5570333 if the sec determines that monies should be paid by citigroup or other financial institutions as a result of these allegations the sec should consider the potential tax deductibility of these payments by citigroup or other financial institutions when determining the appropriate amount of such payments
5570334 this common sense revenue raising legislation has not been enacted into law due in part to opposition from financial institutions including citigroup

5570355 the format of this newsletter is no different than any other newsletter ive ever sent out
5570356 i received very positive feedback from a number of people just yesterday someone came up to me and said this was one of the best energy updates
5570357 we do these periodically and this format is no different than any other piece weve sent out
5570358 well if i could have the media publish this information that would be great but they dont a lot of my press releases are ignored so this is one of the few ways left that i can communicate by the way we keep limitations on how much franked mail we send out i have returned 200 000 in federal funds from my mra i run a frugal office we dont spend a lot of money on a lot of frills but we do feel that from time to time it is necessary to send out an informational mailer on this energy issue my office has received more comments on this and on the issue generally than anything else theyre calling all the time people who did not write in may want to hear where their congressman is on this issue
5570359 yes so we communicate every way we can i do have to stay in touch with my constituents but we limit what we spend on these types of initiatives

5570387 its absolutely false in fact if siobhan bennett and the truth ever came into contact there would be a mighty collision
5570388 i saw that question and heres my financial disclosure statement which i must file
5570389 she said this in a public forum your forum its not like it was done on an anonymous blog it was done in an interview by you theres no question who said it
5570390 she said it to you so there it is and in a public forum id be happy to go through anything in my financial disclosure and id like to contrast that with siobhan bennetts disclosures
5570391 well ill tell you what id get some new financial advisers if i had 25 million in the bank i think i could do better than 200
5570392 so thats her first mistake heres her husbands 401k thats listed at over 50 million verizon was her 401k again 25 to 50 million apparently she worked at the morning call for a brief period of time she actually checked this one between 1 000 to 15 000 in the value of that asset i guess she got that one right but on and on it continues over 50 million in fidelity stock and what the heck is this she lists friends of siobhan bennett as a debt between 25 and 50 million dent starts laughing
5570393 this year she failed to disclose the value of her assets look at the fidelity 401k for example she does not list a value whats she trying to hide last year she overstated her assets by hundreds of millions of dollars this year she failed to disclose her assets to the public as required by law
5570394 in her clean campaign pledge you wanna know what i said we are going to run our campaign based on public issues the issues of the day and matters of public record these
5570395 the only issue for a u s congressman is we have to disclose any assets we have which i have done
5570396 on the dividend issue and its in the disclosures youd see they are less than 200
5570397 well its absurd on its face that somebody who owned a minimal amount of stock in a publicly traded company and thousands of my constituents own stock there was doing that to line his pockets
5570398 theres nothing to that issue of quid pro quo its actually offensive but then again this is just a deflection from the real issue and that is that siobhan bennett took over 100 000 in state tax funds and shoved those dollars with both hands into her pocket at properties of merit
5570399 in similar situations like this in pennsylvania the executive director has been forced to pay back the money there are very serious irs issues that she must address this is a deflection away from her own ethical misconduct which everybody agrees is quite serious so shell raise an issue like that but when most people look at the facts they realize this is just an absurd charge from a desperate career candidate who is really grasping for straws concerned about her political life
5570400 the only health insurance hes taking care of is his own
5570401 yeah i saw that question and the only thing i can say about it is my wife and i had a decision to make when we came to congress we declined federal health benefits and decided to keep the state benefits
5570402 my wife and i declined federal benefits and decided to continue with state benefits that we were already eligible for and that was it siobhan will say whatever she says
5570403 you didnt understand the question because it wasnt a good question
5570404 the second issue here and ill show it to you in the disclosure statement is that i save money
5570405 its deferred compensation it just sits there its my money it came out of my check i put it in there and its valued at between 50 000 and 100 000 now i think that as leaders we like to encourage people to save as much as they possibly can its very hard for a lot of people to save money
5570406 but my grandfather with an 8th grade education who worked for union gas and ugi was really tight with a buck and he always told me to save money he said thats the first thing you do you take your money and save it
5570407 no i suspect he had a relative who said the same thing
5570408 i wont touch that one i wont touch that one
5570409 i think there was a question in there about tuition assistance too thats tap thats a 529 plan its a state plan its a way for you and your wife to save money for your childs education its a college savings account
5570410 the question was not particularly a good one and they were trying to create an issue where there was none
5570411 by the way my state pension is calculated the way all other state employees with pensions are calculated i declined to take the pension rate that state reps and senators receive which is a three per cent multiplier i voted against the pension increase several years ago and did not take the three per cent multiplier that would have added more value to my pension i took a pretty big hit voluntarily so for a person to suggest something untoward is going on well its not reasonable
5570412 what do you do when you are not amusing the whims of the bored aristocracy
5570413 cartography my dear mademoiselle that is the best laugh i have had in ages you are like a jester in your humorous raillery maps during my visit to the library of alexandria i simply could not understand how any ruler could redirect their lands resources towards gazetteers and the like who on earth could possibly see the value in spending a moment referencing geography and refining systems of information

5570523 but the nuttiness is not nearly as widespread in the us
5570524 men are the protectors and maintainers of women because allah has given the one more strength than the other and because they support them from their means therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient and guard in the husbands absence what allah would have them guard as to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill conduct admonish them first next refuse to share their beds and last beat them but if they return to obedience seek not against them means of annoyance for allah is most high great above you all

5570528 are you aware that by taking anwars sodomy ii selective prosecution to the united nations by way of a letter of protest to the un secretary general ban ki moon at american interference in malaysian domestic affairs as well as organising a series of information sessions overseas you are only internationalising malaysias misrule of law which you had so eloquently and devastatingly criticised in your book freedom under executive power exposing the nation to greater mockery in the global arena as we will only be able to depend on rogue states like myanmar zimbabwe and sudan for sympathy and support for the following reasons i deterioration of the rule of law in the past decade since the publication of the book as evident from disturbing developments in the system of justice in the country such as a the selective prosecution of anwar on sodomy ii under section 377b of the penal code on consensual sodomy when the complainant mohd saiful bukhari azlan had alleged that he had been raped which should have come under section 377c on sodomy rape b why saiful was not similarly charged under section 377b on consensual sodomy and the insistence by the prime minister datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi that anwar should also swear on the quran like saiful making malaysia an international laughing stock as to whether we have a prime minister who understands and upholds the system of justice in the country ii grave loss of national and international confidence in the independence impartiality integrity and quality of the system of justice when material witnesses like private investigator bala subramaniam on the mongolian altantunya shaariibuu murder trial and the pusrawi hospital doctor dr

5570549 we have filed a protest looking at whether torri edwards false started and whether the race should have been called back
5570550 i didnt know if they were going to call it
5570551 when i was thinking about it i was getting ahead of myself
5570552 i got out well but i hit some hurdles like 4 at the end
5570553 i knew my foot would fail me i felt painful when i was just jogging
5570554 so many people have been worried and caring about me i feel sorry i could do nothing but pull out of the race
5570555 i didnt know why things turned out this way i wanted to hang on but i couldnt it was unbearable if i had finished the race i would have risked my tendon i could not describe my feeling at that moment
5570556 therell be opportunities next year and afterwards therell still be opportunities after all im still in peak condition i need to be a bit optimistic and cant grumble and blame others
5570557 very concerned about liu xiangs injury and hopes he will receive swift treatment and soon heal
5570558 everyone will understand why liu xiang had to abandon competition due to injury and we hope he will cast aside mental burdens and settle his mind on overcoming injury
5570559 i think football coaches have found the kids have more fun in the spread it allows you to keep some of your best skilled kids without totally losing them to basketball programs and i think its more fun for kids
5570560 rockbridge obviously is a team that does it robert e lee does it thats two games out of 10 scheduled that we have to defend that stuff
5570561 we dont have five or six teams on our schedule doing it but a lot of teams dabble in it
5570562 it was the wide open offense its versatile you can go tight with all your backs or you can spread them out you can run motion and spread people out from the i formation just like you do from the spread we think its a versatile offense and thats why we stuck with it
5570563 i think most coaches are going to run what theyre comfortable with a system that they know there are coaches that are going out and studying it and trying to implement it i dont see coach sarver going to the spread its kind of one of those old clich s if its not broke dont fix it
5570564 were not exclusively going to run that because we dont feel like we have the personnel to run that
5570565 i think you have to have a mobile quarterback that can throw not everybody has a mobile quarterback that can throw the other thing is that i think you have to have several receivers you have to have more than one you have to have three or four pretty quick reliable receivers sometimes you dont have that
5570566 we had a lot of little small guys but not a big running back
5570567 but they could run the ball and they could catch the ball they had speed and agility so we wanted to get them in open space in the spread you can create space by how you align your people and how you get the ball to them
5570568 were over emphasizing the conditioning component because were not going to be strong enough
5570569 they put more stress on your muscles as opposed to last year
5570570 just the constant moving you get a very short break in between the conditioning
5570571 the young kids need to know what it will take to play at the college level
5570572 in the past we excluded the freshmen because we had so many upperclassmen we didnt need the freshmen and partly because we didnt want to scare them
5570573 clark said because were young he cant guarantee well have the best team on the field
5570574 but he can guarantee well be in the best shape
5570575 its being comfortable with the plays and as the quarterback youve got to direct the team anyway
5570576 we put it together because we really werent doing anything over the summer
5570577 in this day and age the commitment you make january through july is what determines how you do september through december
5570578 we call and text each to see when we can work out were just doing what we can over the summer to stay in shape
5570579 you get out of football what you put into football if you give 50 percent you get 50 percent if you give 110 percent youre going to get 110 percent
5570580 i think this is what helps build a young team
5570581 its one of the best things you can do to make you better even working against your own team you do whatever you can
5570582 if a kid chooses to get engaged in this they can get an advantage

5570585 he arrived about five minutes before the show started and stood next to the soundboard
5570586 he was wearing a yankees baseball hat and trying not to be noticed he was really into the show you could tell he was really focused on her
5570587 there is no foreclosure at the moment theres a notice thats been posted i dont really have any other comments there should be no real changes for the residents
5570588 i think it would be a benefit for the public to know when the committee is meeting and to be able to see the information as the committee meets that ultimately will be presented in a report
5570589 we dont want it to happen again and disrupt service
5570590 how many people getting shot or killed is it going to take

5570592 when these guys are robbing these places are they carrying out big bags of stuffed rabbits
5570593 of course not theyve got cash they have to know theyre paying out
5570594 everyone else around is at risk when theres a robber
5570595 its in our neighborhood in a lot of towns thats not the case here theyre amid our homes
5570596 there are some people that are pretty doggone tired of that and i think they have a reason to be
5570597 i tell them as soon as you come in im going to bust you
5570598 export weakness is likely to translate into weaker manufacturing activity in the third quarter we maintain the likelihood of a technical recession this year
5570599 the underlying trend in electronics exports is clearly pointing south
5570600 pharmaceutical exports were down for the fifth consecutive month the longest spate of negative readings in the five year history of the series
5570601 we expect further downward bias to exports in the third and fourth quarters due to flagging growth in the top export markets of europe and the us
5570602 were the only industry of this size and scope that doesnt have a real voice in this process at best were humored at worst were ignored
5570603 is it making our community stronger or are we trapped in that model
5570604 the philanthropic dollars provide us the money to experiment and try new things
5570605 philanthropy can fail in a way that government cant but we can catalyze government investment in growing what works
5570606 there are a lot of people in this sector who will get nervous about the federal government becoming too engaged in philanthropy
5570607 but theres also this other argument that we dont want an agency that is going to over regulate us
5570608 primary advisor to the secretary and the department on energy and technology policy development
5570609 expected to offer opinions and participate in policy debates thats the way the process works
5570610 he always struck me as being naturally and philosophically opposed to regulation at the outset and it took an enormous amount of discussion and analysis to convince him otherwise
5570611 i cant think of a case where chase advocated more environmental or health protections
5570612 even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with the defendants religious beliefs
5570613 he wanted to give them an idea of where he wanted to go with this
5570614 there was no whirring glass bubble like maxwell smart or something like that he was speaking to the integrity of the arrangement
5570615 he literally disabled it even if someone tried to turn it on it wouldnt work
5570616 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5570617 there is not one shred of evidence that its true
5570618 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut
5570619 i dont think were ever going to be able to put the suspicions to bed theres always going to be a spore on the grassy knoll
5570620 it would have been easy to do this at usamriid
5570621 well see if they can turn their attention to governance and get a handle on their problems
5570622 they have been using the musharraf thing as an excuse for non governance
5570623 this is really the moment of truth for pakistan if this fails it is unclear what will happen
5570624 it will take the new government a full year to work things out on counterterrorism a year to make the mistakes they have to make it is a huge experiment
5570625 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing
5570626 pakistan is a critical theater in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5570627 were confident that we will maintain a good relationship with the government of pakistan
5570628 had a good meeting with the prime minister a couple of weeks ago in washington the pakistanis realize that the threat of terrorism the threat of extremism is a threat to them as well as the rest of the world
5570629 he hasnt effectively been leading pakistan for the last six months
5570630 youre truly not going to see any great changes in pakistan with musharrafs resignation with the exception you will start to see greater political infighting among the coalition partners
5570631 you could count on him to make tough decisions even though you could never count on him to completely follow through
5570632 it will probably be much harder to get decisive action as we did with musharraf the good news is that the democracy process is moving forward and it may be possible to create a more durable political framework
5570633 now is a terrific time for renewables to launch i hope they get all the capital they need and all the great minds and talent but i dont want it to come at the expense of the oil and gas industry
5570634 as goes colorado so goes the west as far as this energy policy debate
5570635 the future in colorado is building wind farms in wheat fields

5570639 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
5570640 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour

5570643 completes a pattern of hyped one sided reportage that goes back a while
5570644 my advantage was that i wasnt one of the big favourites they had all the media attention
5570645 i knew this was going to be a tough race the 10 km run was going to be the hardest of my life but i just realised this is what i have been dreaming of this is my only chance
5570646 i got to 7km on the run and there was nothing left
5570647 ive got to find a way of getting 12 places better in time for london
5570648 in 2000 2001 there was no pay rise in 2002 it was only a half a percent when i first started the wages were 15 to 20 percent higher at spt than at other factories but now the wages are lower than other companies
5570649 its going to be a very difficult process for members to get high paying jobs highly skilled jobs
5570650 south pacific tyres respects the role of various unions in representing its workforce and will engage and collaborate with associates and their unions to ensure a smooth transition
5570651 the decision to close somerton demonstrates a worrying trend of companies taking their work offshore to places like china for cheaper unregulated labour
5570652 this sends a chilling message to those going through the same process
5570653 its creating a wave of stress among everybody if jeremy hinzman who has a wife and kids can be kicked out what about the single guys who have been here for a shorter period of time
5570654 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5570655 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
5570656 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5570657 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
5570658 he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker

5570660 if youve got book sales of 25 million then you qualify
5570661 if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
5570662 some of the richest people ive known in my life are the most unhappy
5570663 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5570664 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
5570665 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5570666 ones faith and religion in my view is something between me and god
5570667 when school authorities find it convenient they claim to have no responsibility because they are part of the church things that have to do with money pertain to the state even though the money goes to them for that reason we are on hunger strike

5570669 what happened how did we pass from heaven to hell
5570670 if this happens with one of the big ones who knows what is happening with medium and small size promoters
5570671 the problem is debt these are companies that grew very fast thanks to very generous financing from the banking sector
5570672 if the loan had been granted other companies with similar problems would start lining up
5570673 a reminder if any were needed of the massive scale of the spanish property crash serious financial and economic distress is almost inevitable do not be fooled by the fact that spanish banks had virtually no exposure to us subprime mortgages being exposed to spanish mortgages is probably worse
5570674 the crisis goes well beyond the construction sector this is very negative data that shows that inflation is starting to have a second round of effect
5570675 the overall conclusion in the international business world is that spain is heading downhill fast its economy reeling from the bursting of the real estate bubble amid a global credit crunch as the spectre of rampant inflation fuelled by soaring fuel and food prices looms increasingly large some companies wrap their worries about spain in euphemisms spain is the country facing the most challenging situation others are much more blunt singling spain out as the weakest link in their business
5570676 from carmakers and cement manufacturers to tour operators and white goods distributors virtually every big multinational is feeling the pinch from its spanish operations renault volkswagen honda ford cemex abb ericsson philips avis royal caribbean and danone are just a few of the companies that have blamed spain for some of their troubles most of their comments had little immediate impact but in the case of vodafone the companys admission of its problems in spain caused its share price to plunge
5570677 if we dont reach an agreement the company will not survive
5570678 the beneficiaries end the silly policies that got them into the mess in the first place
5570679 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mindset that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
5570680 the current crisis is the outcome of policies long advertised as a great success
5570681 a friend of the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5570682 nobody wants the pandoras box opened up the issue of impeachment is really a non starter
5570683 how can safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
5570684 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5570685 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be part of georgias future
5570686 theres no room for debate on this matter the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the us fully recognizes this reality
5570687 one indication that some russians may have been pulled back was a georgian army barracks in gori which was full of russian soldiers on sunday but was nearly deserted today except for a lone tank standing guard
5570688 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5570689 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be one of the most significant events to occur in europe since the end of communism
5570690 we will not hesitate to act alone if necessary to exercise our right of self defense by acting pre emptively
5570691 rule out the use of force before attacks occur even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemys attack
5570692 the opposition can demonstrate in the autumn against the finanziaria as much as it wishes but it might just as well demonstrate against the rain
5570693 russland setzt momentan leider das werkzeug ein das es schon immer eingesetzt hat wenn es eine botschaft klarmachen will und das ist seine milit rische macht
5570694 das ist als w rden sie eine woche auf den notarzt warten
5570695 es gibt keine friedliche l sung ohne russland diesen gro en nachbarn der europ ischen union
5570696 ich hoffe die welt wacht auf und sieht was passiert
5570697 das schlimmste was die welt tun k nnte w re es kompromisse einzugehen und schw che zu zeigen
5570698 gorbatschow redet bl dsinn wenn er sagt georgien sei schuld an der russischen invasion
5570699 ich finde keine andere erkl rung als diese das ist eine aggression gegen eine unabh ngige demokratische republik ich schlage gorbatschow vor mehr ber die aggressivit t russlands nachzudenken statt einfach georgien die schuld zu geben
5570700 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5570701 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5570702 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5570703 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5570704 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5570705 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5570706 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5570707 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5570708 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5570709 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5570710 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5570711 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5570712 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5570713 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5570714 i had to go because she was afraid and the children needed me
5570715 it would be the end of the world with my first wife if i didnt make it to see her and its the same with the second one
5570716 there werent any taxis so i had to walk and because there was fighting on the main streets of sadr city i had to use the back alleys it would take me half an hour to leave sadr city and sometimes this half hour felt like a whole year
5570717 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack on ones convictions
5570718 i kind of fought my way on there and i thought theres no time like the present
5570719 i tried to make it a battle of pure willpower i gave it everything i had
5570720 i dont know what happened i feel very regretful too
5570721 on that day i really couldnt stand the pain i cant describe that feeling
5570722 we are delighted that olympics athletes took the opportunity to download this unique album which conveys a message of hope and solidarity with the tibetan people as well as a commitment to freedom of expression that cannot be suppressed
5570723 and what does the lord require of you to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your god
5570724 i prayed to god that he would change johnny but he changed me
5570725 i have ordered ther armed forces of the philippines and the philippine national police to defend every inch of territory against the milf force we will not tolerate and will crush any attempt to disturb peace and development in mindanao
5570726 ang may kasalanan dito ay ang nagsimula ng putukan at ang gobyerno kung saan pina asa lamang daw ng government panel ang milf gayong alam naman nilang mahirap ma attain ang mga nakapa loob sa moa patunay lang ito na bulok ang moa
5570727 this is not going to be the end of you remember last year when you had to stand up in four different weddings in as many weeks this isnt as bad as that and youll get over it soon enough
5570728 i had a hard time getting used to brandon being gone after he moved in with jess
5570729 those pictures are pretty huge files it may be a bit much for the old thing
5570730 so you think that john will want you to come to the wedding
5570731 no idea itll probably depend on how big she wants it to be satellite friends dont get invitations to small weddings
5570732 the new oil order has been emerging for a few decades
5570733 man i dont know where the fuck they came from but i cant be having to worry about whitey waiting around every corner trying to curb stomp me where the fuck were you
5570734 nigger i was out back with 60 drinking grape drink and doing the chronic

5570746 all it takes for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing
5570747 maybe you think you can intimidate me or will stop other bloggers from speaking the truth about your barbaric mass murdering death cult well screw you and the camel you rode in i will not be silenced and we will not be silenced all you do with terroristic threats is to demonstrate your evil nature confirm our resolve to resist you and speed the day when your diseased religion will be wiped from the face of the earth
5570748 they look very aggressive i think they wanna beat me up
5570749 trust me youll be fine just take the thin mints back into the apartment thats our food for the week

5570756 but it cant be set up like the checkpoint at the new york stock exchange which is inhospitable to anyone living or working in the area seven small businesses closed within a year of n y p d setting up the checkpoint at the stock exchange
5570757 nobody contemplated that you wouldnt have free entrance to the site
5570758 it was generally accepted that the streets would be like the rest of manhattan lined with retail stores
5570759 your humble narrator bet the ones who make that rule dont have any problem with their hearing
5570760 mccain has lost all touch with the realities of american families
5570761 why did god create women to be beautiful but foolish
5570762 as he has done on other occasions pitt talked glowingly of the science and aesthetics of architecture
5570763 rose asked him if he knew of any way to combine his passion for architecture with his passion for acting he wondered if there was any story of a great architect that might inspire pitt
5570764 that would go back to the fountainhead pitt replied rose wondered if pitt would even consider re making it pitt said that the book is so dense and complex it would have to be a six hour movie i dont know how you do it under four and not lose really lose what ayn rand was after but he affirmed his profound interest to star in a re make and cited oliver stones own interest in directing it as a feature film
5570765 what am i reading ive been very into ayn rand so ive read the fountainhead and then atlas shrugged
5570766 you re evaluate your own life and whats important to you
5570767 was the book ive been rereading most of my life the fountainhead

5570772 the problem today is his foot its not clear exactly when it began but it is six or seven years old it was there before the 2004 athens games and it has been coming and going
5570773 its the end of the achilles tendon in his right foot im afraid he wont be able to compete before the end of the year he can barely walk he was in tears hes very depressed
5570774 liu xiang would not have withdrawn unless the pain was intolerable and there was no other way out
5570775 until last saturday he was in good shape we did all we could i think all the chinese people will understand this situation and will encourage him to come back to the track
5570776 this morning he felt the pain intensify even though he felt the pain he decided to compete in the first heat
5570777 hasil kerjamu sungguh luar biasa saya sangat kagum dengan kemampuanmu menebang pohon pohon itu belum pernah ada yang sepertimu sebelum ini teruskan bekerja seperti itu
5570778 sepertinya aku telah kehilangan kemampuan dan kekuatanku bagaimana aku dapat mempertanggungjawabkan hasil kerjaku kepada majikan
5570779 mengasah kapak saya tidak punya waktu untuk itu saya sangat sibuk setiap hari menebang pohon dari pagi hingga sore dengan sekuat tenaga
5570780 nah di sinilah masalahnya ingat hari pertama kamu kerja dengan kapak baru dan terasah maka kamu bisa menebang pohon dengan hasil luar biasa hari hari berikutnya dengan tenaga yang sama menggunakan kapak yang sama tetapi tidak diasah kamu tahu sendiri hasilnya semakin menurun maka sesibuk apa pun kamu harus meluangkan waktu untuk mengasah kapakmu agar setiap hari bekerja dengan tenaga yang sama dan hasil yang maksimal sekarang mulailah mengasah kapakmu dan segera kembali bekerja
5570781 xiu xi bu shi zou deng yu chang de lu
5570782 hes an icon here in china he has a very bright future
5570783 if anybody takes a hit from it its certainly nike simply because theyre all about performance whereas the others are about brand image
5570784 nikes all about you dont win silver you lose gold with that attitude its much tougher for them because he was certainly the cornerstone for their program
5570785 whenever he goes out he sees his own picture in the streets
5570786 we will continue to count on liu xiang as an ambassador for our company and our brand because his achievements both on and off the field will continue to inspire fans and consumers throughout china
5570787 its about picking yourself up when youre down and coming back stronger
5570788 el show de los sue os sangre de mi sangre
5570789 did god really join us or did we insist on joining ourselves to each other
5570790 let me try to give a summary of the book chapter by chapter each chapter is a gem
5570791 did god really join us or did we insist on joining ourselves to each other
5570792 se o aproba o consello deixar de ser responsabilidade de pesca controlada polo psdeg e converterase nun proxecto de todo o goberno
5570793 lanzar unha mensaxe moi clara ao bng se o apoian vai haber cr ticas para todos
5570794 jj apparently thinks we should be free to commit all sorts of crimes we are but not without consequences
5570795 they want to hold pregnant women who are innocent of any wrongdoing to a punitive standard of specific performance
5570796 i will do everything in my power to help the cincinnati bengals win a super bowl
5570797 jesuss agenda is far bigger than just one or two issues we have to care about poverty we have to care about disease we have to care about illiteracy we have to care about corruption in government sex trafficking
5570798 if obama ever establishes any kind of trust with evangelicals there will be a noticeable shift
5570799 it will not be huge but it will be significant
5570800 number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
5570801 the encouraging thing is that in 2004 we didnt have any part in the platform discussion
5570802 this time the party wanted us as a partner in the process they reached out to us and wanted to hear what we had to say
5570803 cigarettes more expensive so that more smokers are enticed to quit and fewer young people ever start
5570804 era imposible mirar os ra s un minuto seguido e non sentir dor na retina
5570805 we let it be known with the dodgers that was the one ballclub he had interest in going to that any deal we were going to do was going to be the best baseball deal we could do and it wasnt going to be a financial deal to try to move dollars we just werent happy with the prospect we would be getting back and we chose to hold onto him
5570806 he is an excellent athlete no matter how old she is shes done her hard work and her preparation and she deserved that gold medal tonight
5570807 he is an excellent athlete no matter how old she is shes done her hard work and her preparation and she deserved that gold medal tonight
5570808 i looked around in the press area and chinese journalists were crying
5570809 i dont think were ever going to be able to put the suspicions to bed theres always going to be a spore on the grassy knoll
5570810 it would have been easy to do this at usamriid
5570811 not because were perspicacious geniuses quite the reverse weve looked at a number of cdo trading strategies and to be honest we just couldnt understand what the drivers really were were bears of small brain conversely we did understand basis capitals fixed income strategies though never actually invested there either
5570812 we had redeemed from basis nearly three years ago and have not re invested back since
5570813 we have been bearish on credit therefore the allocation in our portfolios is with managers holding the same view as a result our portfolios should benefit from the spillover effect of the sub prime problems
5570814 we should do well on a relative basis if the market turns more negative
5570815 beginning in 2006 many of the credit managers in our investment pool which tend to be research driven have been moving to a short stance on tranches of sub prime abs cdos
5570816 they believe this to represent a good risk reward trade especially in the mezzanine tranches
5570817 in february we were up 13 net in our unleveraged merger and event funds and up 80 in our dedicated credit fund
5570818 you have a tendency to get more emotional about it in a hedge fund because its your ass
5570819 you just cant keep a buy rating on something for a year
5570820 instead of collateral based lending they have moved towards becoming cash based lenders they have also learned more about matching assets and liabilities by currency and maturity
5570821 skills of managers are reasonably good in hong kong and singapore
5570822 in other markets they need to improve their ability to estimate and reserve against under performing loans asian markets still have insolvent banks that are being kept alive artificially
5570823 one of the most interesting things to note is that most hedge funds think that chinese banks are worthless yet all own them
5570824 foreign banks are now taking stakes in thai banks indonesia has become a lot more professional and i think youll see more domestic mergers there in the philippines banks have been slow about getting rid of bad assets with the result that real estate has become illiquid and financial institutions have been a drag on the philippine economy
5570825 almost all big korean banks have been bulldozed together by the government
5570826 there are no common systems no common culture no common concepts of risk management when i talk to the korean banks they all talk the talk but they cant walk the walk they lurch from crisis to crisis from chaebols to credit cards to smes and now to property they all tell me that property exposure is under very tight control by whose definition
5570827 in taiwan every analyst knows that the taiwanese banks lie they lie about their npls which is why every so often a taiwanese bank blows up and disappears the government rushes to the rescue eliminating the need to learn from the mistakes in just the last four months four or five taiwanese banks have disappeared again bulldozed into bigger banks and the cycle starts again no consensus on governance credit or anything else one of the banks told me they had three lunch rooms one for each of the successor institutions
5570828 frequently this is a hedge fund managers first go at running a fund and their biggest issue is simply getting going
5570829 that is because predominantly investors money comes from the united states and europe
5570830 we have been talking about the character we wanted to create and pursuing our dream casting which is laurence fishburne
5570831 will be involved in a case together in episodes 9 and 10
5570832 petersens character gil will definitely have an opinion on who this guy is the idea is to see a lot of billy and laurence together
5570833 the episodes they sent to me were really engaging and wonderful and kind of dark and moody
5570834 we have been talking about the character we wanted to create and pursuing our dream casting which is laurence fishburne
5570835 will be involved in a case together in episodes 9 and 10
5570836 petersens character gil will definitely have an opinion on who this guy is the idea is to see a lot of billy and laurence together
5570837 the episodes they sent to me were really engaging and wonderful and kind of dark and moody
5570838 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5570839 blood and marrow transplantation from unrelated donors has been routinely utilized to treat treatment refractory leukemia and lymphoma for almost two decades
5570840 preliminary results from the few unrelated donor transplants that have been performed for other non malignant conditions show great promise for those who suffer a severely diminished quality of life due to sickle cell disease participants in this large scale study will help us understand how to better treat and possibly even cure sickle cell disease for more people
5570841 pasti ia sengaja ingin rasanya saya memukulnya karena itulah saya kalah
5570842 seandainya garis ini adalah garis dari lawanmu coba bagaimana caramu agar garis lawanmu ini menjadi lebih pendek
5570843 did god really join us or did we insist on joining ourselves to each other
5570844 nu wel zat daarvan gaak me echt niet beter voelen alsof ze het niet zien dat je een pasgeborene in de wagen hebt liggen pfffffffff erg hoor zo heb mijn hart ook weer ff kunnen luchten hihi
5570845 by being able to silence certain genes we may be able to suppress genes that can cause diseases such as hiv aids cancer inflammation and diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems we now know we can focus on these genes and potentially change the ultimate course of many diseases that have a major impact on peoples lives
5570846 theyre regulators of mood and emotion so if you can eliminate the metabolites that have been implicated in pmdd you may create a huge benefit for women with pmdd
5570847 we believe this trial will help us understand the underlying physiology which will allow for the development of a range of possible new treatments
5570848 id gain weight my face would be puffy i had horrible cramps and that would get me mentally down the symptoms changed as i matured and had children it gradually became more emotional now it also affects my mental acuity and i can still get down sometimes
5570849 the impairment and reduction in quality of life for women with pmdd during their premenstrual phase is equivalent to people with major depression anxiety disorder and even post traumatic stress disorder
5570850 if we can show that continuous low dose contraceptives are effective that opens up another option that may have a better risk benefit profile than ssris
5570851 many women in our previous studies felt better knowing they were contributing to furthering our knowledge about this disorder and informing subsequent treatment options
5570852 we can give them a gold standard diagnosis if they do have pmdd and if they have something else we can help them find treatment for it
5570853 i know what to do and where to go i have all the information and i know help is there theres such a peace of mind from that
5570854 the more we understand the better we can treat it and the better for everyone
5570855 there is so much lost productivity in women with pmdd just think how much more a woman could accomplish if she didnt have to lose so much of herself and her energy every month
5570856 so we hypothesized that the combination of hiv infected monocytes and elevated lps levels would amplify the ability of hiv to cross the bbb and get into the brain
5570857 clearly hiv infected monocytes uniquely benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people
5570858 so when hiv infected monocytes are knocking on the door of the bbb and starting to crack it open the lps facilitates their entry by making the bbb more permeable apparently by weakening blood vessel structure
5570859 these results demonstrate very dramatically that hiv infection of cells associated with the bbb in conjunction with lps exposure contributes to bbb breakdown
5570860 so when hiv infection occurs we seem to have a 1 2 3 combination of punches working in concert to facilitate entry of hiv infected monocytes into the bbb protected brain hiv infection of monocytes increases their capacity to cross even an intact bbb hiv infection in the gut releases lps into the bloodstream allowing it to erode the bbb and hiv infection of the cells of the bbb makes them more sensitive to the deleterious effects of lps
5570861 we may be able to use antibiotics that kill intestinal bacteria that make lps and drugs are already available that can bind to lps and clear it from the bloodstream
5570862 ideally we would promptly start newly diagnosed hiv infected patients on a treatment to reinforce their bbbs so that hiv cant penetrate it and perhaps we could even strengthen the bbbs of people whove been infected for quite a while but before we can prevent the tragedy of hiv associated dementia we need to better understand the mechanism by which these molecular and cellular punches interact to undermine the bbb
5570863 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
5570864 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanisms by which many pathogens invade cells
5570865 its an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter
5570866 this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
5570867 in essence the technology can be used to overcome one of the most challenging types of problems of drug resistance
5570868 if youre not recognized as being part of the club then youre kicked out
5570869 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club then effectively what were doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door
5570870 this could potentially be used with any drug which is effective but has a delivery problem
5570871 as the transporter with all these arginine guanidinium groups approaches the cell it basically does a handshake using hydrogen bonds with cell surface constituents that are in the membrane
5570872 in essence it changes its physical properties by shaking hands with all these cell membrane components
5570873 ovarian cancer has a drug taxol that works pretty well in the beginning seventy or eighty percent of the patients have a response
5570874 but it fails at the end because drug resistance develops
5570875 itll still going to be cheaper to be a pierce township resident because theres no stopping this 1 income tax

5570877 we have no say its almost like taxation without representation
5570878 not because were perspicacious geniuses quite the reverse weve looked at a number of cdo trading strategies and to be honest we just couldnt understand what the drivers really were were bears of small brain conversely we did understand basis capitals fixed income strategies though never actually invested there either
5570879 we had redeemed from basis nearly three years ago and have not re invested back since
5570880 we have been bearish on credit therefore the allocation in our portfolios is with managers holding the same view as a result our portfolios should benefit from the spillover effect of the sub prime problems
5570881 we should do well on a relative basis if the market turns more negative
5570882 beginning in 2006 many of the credit managers in our investment pool which tend to be research driven have been moving to a short stance on tranches of sub prime abs cdos
5570883 they believe this to represent a good risk reward trade especially in the mezzanine tranches
5570884 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this
5570885 if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response we have all the necessary resources political economic and military

5570892 we found that in san diego the port of los angeles can be a significant influence on air quality because these fine particulates can travel so far
5570893 this will tell us whether californias new regulation requiring cleaner burning fuel 24 miles off the coast is having the effect its intended to have
5570894 and because a large part of the worlds population live in major cities with shipping ports such as new york city san francisco hong kong houston and singapore and global shipping is expected to increase in the decades to come this should help policy makers around the world make more informed decisions about improving the health of their citizens
5570895 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations currently autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5570896 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5570897 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
5570898 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that
5570899 our research group is exploiting a tremendous overlap of knowledge from many disciplines yes work will be a pivotal part of anrgs grand scheme
5570900 to solve these problems it takes an entire community of specialists working together
5570901 we in the south pacific and pacific island countries in particular take democracy seriously
5570902 that is why we dont believe that we can sit idly by while the principles of democracy are shredded
5570903 therefore the resolve of pacific island countries is that we act in concert on this question and we look forward very much to the discussion which will now occur minus fiji in niue on how this matter should be handled into the future
5570904 bainimaramas contempt for regional leaders such as the grand chief of papua new guinea sir michael somare on this question have to be taken into account and i think its going to turn into a very interesting discussion in niue in terms of this decision not to attend
5570905 i personally intervened to ensure that transit visas were available for the fiji delegation to go through auckland airport to niue so that they could be accountable to forum leaders for commitments given last year
5570906 no doubt the forum will be in touch with the interim government of fiji afterwards to convey the views of the forum
5570907 well i suppose it is understandable in the current situation they have in suva it may mean that we will be able to concentrate on some of a bit more the regional issues that weve been talking about

5570928 the number of times that a physician will deal with a surrogate decision maker is growing as our population ages and conditions such as alzheimers disease become more common the issue of how physicians interact with surrogates is a very important one we found that physicians often want to take an active role in determining what is right for a patient and often grapple with the needs of the patient versus those of the surrogate
5570929 i always think its important that its not a decision that the family member or the surrogate is making for themselves but it is a decision that they are making for someone else based upon their best knowledge of what that person would want
5570930 when i feel strongly that the patients quality of life is really poor then i do feel that it is appropriate for the physician to try and guide the family member toward a decision
5570931 if the patient cant make the decision then i discuss it with the family i sometimes will push the family to do what i think is best for the patient
5570932 i think family burden is an issue i dont think it should govern what the final decision is but i do think it should be addressed
5570933 if they screw up in a building and they deliberately do things that are wrong in the building just to pocket money and people die because of it then people should be held accountable
5570934 only in recent years has there been a substantial effort to manufacture child friendly formulations of first line tuberculosis drugs such as crushable mini pills granules oral suspensions
5570935 and in the past 15 years children have been included in only one study of new agents for tuberculosis a large phase 3 trial evaluating once weekly rifapentine isoniazid for treatment of latent tuberculosis
5570936 children have the same right to benefit from research as do adults
5570937 while this lack of involvement may be understandable in the short term it is not acceptable in the long term

5570950 in a relatively slow paced first half with play confined to the midfield for long stretches of time argentina soon went ahead with facundo callionis first ever champions trophy goal callioni controlled a long scoop from the back well to launch a shot that was saved by quico cortes but he made no mistake on the rebound slapping the ball past the spanish goalkeeper on the second try ten minutes later spain broke an argentinean shutout lasting almost 150 minutes when a free hit saw the ball slip through the crowded circle to meet a diving santi freixa who swept it into the roof of the goal with the score deadlocked both teams tried for chances but without much conviction and they went into halftime tied at one all a penalty corner shortly after the break gave spain the lead and santi freixa his second goal of the day with a dragflick to the bottom right corner
5570951 la selecci n dirigida por carlos retegui ganaba con el gol de facundo callioni en la primera etapa pero a trav s de los dos tantos de santi freixa espa a se qued con el triunfo por 2 1 de esta manera argentina perdi el invicto y por ahora comparte el liderazgo con los espa oles con 7 puntos

5570955 we have to get behind him and support him because he is a tremendous force and he is of tremendous importance for the team you want your own fans to be behind him
5570956 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides but overall i am positive he will recover

5570966 es un dato preocupante que refleja la desaceleraci n econ mica y enciende las alarmas si se le suma que en junio los desempleados aumentaron en n mero absoluto
5570967 son cifras dif ciles de comparar pues el ministerio no toma la informalidad por el n mero de trabajadores de una empresa es un tema que hay que mirar con detenimiento pues posiblemente es un efecto de la desaceleraci n de la econom a
5570968 el sector productivo est cambiando y las empresas ya no est n contratando directamente sino que buscan intermediarios para sus relaciones laborales en esa medida todas esas personas que est n en las cooperativas de trabajo asociado y que est n como temporales son independientes e hicieron que creciera la informalidad

5570970 when this trend spreads and i say when not if this will be a tax on the utility of the web that must be counterbalanced by the utility of the intervening pages
5570971 if they are really good with lots of useful curated data that you wouldnt easily find elsewhere this may be an acceptable tax in fact they may even be beneficial and a real way to increase the value of the site to its readers if they are purely designed to capture additional clicks they will be a degradation of the webs fundamental currency much like the black hat search engine pages that construct link farms out of search engine results
5570972 i feel like were at the beginning of phase two
5570973 im back out there doing some football stuff a couple days from now i want to go out and do individuals kind of start phase three and just work my way back into practice hopefully that happens soon
5570974 it looked a lot like the workouts hes been having the last couple of weeks i think the recovery each time he does that work out gets better and hes still on target to play when the season starts what hes able to do over the next ten days we will just have to wait and see
5570975 at first i was just so depressed because its like you hit a wall
5570976 my goal was to be ready for the season at one point i wasnt real sure that was going to happen but now i do
5570977 every time it feels better i go harder so it just brings it right back to where it was
5570978 im trying to determine at what point it gets sore because then ill stop before it gets real sore when it gets sore i think ive got to get through this then i keep going it gets more sore and im back to limping in my walk ive tried to be patient and tried to be smart this is another step where i just have to do both of those things
5570979 every time he goes out he says he feels better he says he feels less pain it recovers faster
5570980 its an impressive sight to watch the guy run routes and workout and go and obviously when hes going and part of our group we are a substantially better football team
5570981 weve got two lineman out were playing with two young backs we were playing a blitzing team
5570982 i didnt feel he needed to test how many times he could get hit or pounded to find out how tough he is hes proven that to me
5570983 i look forward to playing a significant amount go out there and stringing a handful of plays together
5570984 you approach every game like youre going the whole game but this is one you really can the third one you can really go and know youre going to be in there a while

5570988 i noted that thanks to ohio law chl holders are banned from attending worship services or even entering the building while armed unless they have received special permission from church synagogue mosque officials
5570989 i recounted a discussion by new life church pastor brady boyd over how churches need to recognize that they are targets of violence in this day and age and about how thankfully his church had prepared in advance for such a day
5570990 offers church leaders advice on making all types of security preparations
5570991 as a shepherd i want to make sure my sheep are safe
5570992 if somebody comes in shooting at our church theyre not going to be shooting a lot of people
5570993 its really a challenge because you cant really impose the kind of security that youd like to like frisking people in a church setting you cant be intrusive
5570994 theres not too much a small temple with limited resources can do
5570995 particularly against a determined assailant small congregations like ours must rely on the peacefulness we create the wisdom we practice and the non violence we teach to create an atmosphere which can discourage or defuse such terrible hatred
5570996 the wise man foresees danger and plans ahead the simpleton plunges forward and suffers the consequences
5570997 theres nowhere in the bible where god says just go blindly and live dangerously let my will be done one way or the other it just doesnt work that way
5570998 seven people killed in brookfield wisconsin in 2005 five people killed in baton rouge louisiana in 2006 five people killed in st louis in 2007
5570999 we have a paid security person who is there for sunday services and some weekday services and we always have him for weddings and funerals
5571000 its a dirty shame that it comes down to that
5571001 unfortunately the way society is today you have to be better safe than sorry
5571002 prior to that incident we had ushers but they werent really looking at the kind of things theyre looking at now
5571003 i think the conversation should happen all across the country whether its a church in the inner city or the far reaches
5571004 when you minister broken people youre going to get everything on a sunday or wednesday or daily basis
5571005 some churches because of their size they need armed security
5571006 you have to be able to protect those in that group that really want to come and hear a word from god
5571007 basically we were a very unsecured building not keeping a close watch on our property not locking up not keeping an eye on who was in and out of our church
5571008 has a lack of an incidence at our church been because of steps weve taken to keep our property and people safe or are we just lucky

5571017 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback

5571019 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5571020 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5571021 i wish it was sort of true being on quidditch with him would be kind of cool
5571022 we say join the club it makes us feel old too
5571023 but if youve got a certain degree of wisdom and your body hasnt fallen apart yet you may be at the best time of your life
5571024 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5571025 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5571026 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction

5571062 in the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an american and assimilates himself to us he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birthplace or origin but this is predicated upon the persons becoming in every facet an american and nothing but an american there can be no divided allegiance here any man who says he is an american but something else also isnt an american at all we have room for but one flag the american flag we have room for but one language here and that is the english language and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the american people
5571063 let us say to the immigrant not that we hope he will learn english but that he has got to

5571071 weve been hearing a lot about android recently from delayed release dates to a video claiming to depict the fabled htc dream in action what we havent heard however is anything specific about the public availability of the first android devices to hit the streets htc and t mobile have been promising an android based device by the end of this year but havent gone any further into the specifics tmonews is now claiming that the htc dream will in fact be the first android device to reach our hands the site is reporting that t mobile will begin offering the dream via a special promotional pre sale event beginning september 17th which is just over a month from now the device will reportedly cost 150 for current t mobile subscribers though it could sell for as much as 399 when it goes on sale to the general public some time later
5571072 ringtones have become such personal statements that a specially created condom ringtone seemed just the right vehicle to define its user as a sensible person
5571073 third culture kids are those who have spent some of their growing up years in a foreign country and experience a sense of not belonging to their passport country when they return to it in adapting to life in a foreign country they have also missed learning ways of their homeland and feel most at home in the third culture which they have created

5571083 for a short while i thought i had clinched it but anton was simply too good he deserves to win
5571084 im disappointed especially since it was a close thing between jason and me but all credit to him and anton and to suzuki for organising a great event
5571085 there is no doubt that the suzuki acceleration series has been a huge success its an example of the innovative marketing strategies we are employing
5571086 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of constitution
5571087 i would never support b hussein obama nor any other black left wing liberal i dont think that they can be strong enough in their profession or activities or even strong thinkers to ever be elevated to any position of high esteem setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with them on alot of issues
5571088 they went with a flat back four and did a good job of drawing us offside in the first half but we made some adjustments at the half and did a much better job with it in the second half
5571089 this might be the first time in 20 years we did something like this change defenses
5571090 i thought we did a pretty nice job with it until we fell asleep there in the second half

5571108 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5571109 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5571110 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5571111 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5571112 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5571113 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5571114 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5571115 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5571116 dont worry well be home soon be a good boy
5571117 we are committed to ethical arrangements and ensuring that interactions between industry and health care providers enhance the publics health and foster public confidence unfortunately this legislation would impede important interactions with providers and could drive this critical research and development out of state
5571118 unlike other segments of the health care sector medical technology is often developed and refined based on input from physicians who have direct and constant feedback from their patients training by manufacturers to providers is often critical to the safe use of complex technology
5571119 americas medical device manufacturers believe that patients should have full confidence that the only factor influencing a physicians decision making is the best interests of the patient
5571120 in addition advameds code of ethics adopted in 2003 is tailored to the unique interactions among the medical device industry and health care professionals to preserve ethical collaborations that fuel advances in medical technology and ensure patient access to the most advanced technologies
5571121 were very encouraged with how weve been able to drive generic utilization for our members and consumers because we know that the use of generic medications is the most effective way to keep prescription drug spending manageable
5571122 a lack of blockbuster drugs in the pharmaceutical development pipeline along with increasing acceptance of generic drugs by consumers suggests that the low increase we saw during 2007 will be sustained for some time to come
5571123 these factors may promote the long term use of proton pump inhibitors leaving patients at increased risk of osteoporosis related fractures
5571124 caveat emptor applies when buying any product online from an unknown source or a reseller like e bay or amazon it presents a real danger when buying purported cosmetic injectables the buyer has no idea if its product is genuine or safe
5571125 theres a possibility the product has been obtained illegally stored improperly or packaged incorrectly all of these things can lead to poor outcomes including disfigurement infection or in some cases even death it is in your best interest to seek out a qualified physician and not take the risk from buying online
5571126 genuine fda approved cosmetic injections in a proper medical setting administered by a board certified and properly qualified physician are vastly safe and rewarding procedures says coalition leader mark codner md of atlanta ga
5571127 counterfeit injectables and injectables that are not used properly can have devastating side effects by injecting yourself or someone you know you are not only taking on risk you are engaging in the practice of medicine without a license which in all 50 states is a criminal offense
5571128 the success of any cosmetic injection relies heavily on two very important factors your doctor and the brand of injectable
5571129 the expertise and training of your physician and the relationship you have with that physician and the proven track record of an authentic and properly prescribed and administered injectable mean the difference between a good or negative outcome
5571130 the decision to suspend enrollment in this clinical trial is based solely on the results reported in a recently published study comparing laser treatment and intravitreal injections of ta

5571143 i dont think he warnock has been affected by what appears to be an ambush
5571144 robbies a required player and in the end that will be his decision about what he wants to do
5571145 id love him to stay i think hes got some good scope and id love to work with him over the next couple of years
5571146 he probably understands hes still evolving as a player and hes probably going to play with a guy sandilands that hopefully asserts himself into a dominant ruckman for a period of time
5571147 and robbie can play along with that for many years to come and thats the striking thing that he should be looking forward to at this stage
5571148 it will be great if he does but at the end of the day its up to him and well just see what happens
5571149 hes very important hes a great player to have around the club a great person and a great football player
5571150 its fantastic my manager and the club have been working pretty hard in the last couple of weeks and they knocked it over pretty quickly so now i can look forward to playing some good footy
5571151 the club has been fantastic for me not only with my footy but off the field as well with some issues they have really helped me out so i want to pay them back
5571152 the playing group is fantastic and a huge reason why i signed up
5571153 we are just enhancing the security in manila with regards to the peace and order situation in mindanao
5571154 this is just our precautionary measure we will also be conducting checkpoints
5571155 utterly baseless charge that is just a pretext to prevent him from posting more articles critical of the government
5571156 dieu cay posted articles criticizing chinas policy in the south china sea where both the chinese and vietnamese governments claim sovereignty over the spratly and paracel islands
5571157 the vietnamese authorities are copying their chinese neighbors both as regards internet filtering and harassment of internet users we call for dieu cays release
5571158 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5571159 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5571160 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5571161 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there
5571162 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5571163 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5571164 i wish it was sort of true being on quidditch with him would be kind of cool
5571165 we say join the club it makes us feel old too
5571166 but if youve got a certain degree of wisdom and your body hasnt fallen apart yet you may be at the best time of your life
5571167 located on the top right of this screen im trying to make the price as low as possible that many people think im a fake seller
5571168 weve accomplished one goal to get to the gold medal match but were not done yet we want to get out there and kick butt against the chinese on their home soil
5571169 the court should also award monetary damages to class members to the extent their costs to attend the games cannot be adequately covered by the provision of free season tickets
5571170 the plaintiffs and all class members are entitled to renew their season tickets at the same price they paid in seattle and obtain comparable seats at the ford center
5571171 they should also be able to maintain their priority ticket numbers the fact that the team formerly known as the sonics is now playing in oklahoma city does not negate the defendants contractual obligations
5571172 the defendant in its short time in seattle has demonstrated a total disregard for its contractual obligations
5571173 the plaintiffs agree that if any of next seasons oklahoma city games are canceled they are not entitled to specifically force kevin durant or russell westbrook onto the court
5571174 instead the plaintiffs are seeking the right guaranteed by their option contract with the defendant to purchase tickets at the same price they paid last year
5571175 i compare this the talks to a shattered glass it would be very difficult to put the pieces together
5571176 we have already freed the towns we are on pursuit operations we will not stop until we catch up with them
5571177 they killed innocent defenceless civilians people are traumatized we need food medicines we want the soldiers here
5571178 will defend them at all costs against any move by any group that will disrupt our aspirations for a genuine and lasting peace
5571179 this is a consequence of the non movement of the peace process
5571180 origin is a strongly performing australian integrated energy company with an impressive track record of growth
5571181 origin has developed the leading position in coal seam gas csg in australia and the strength of this position will be a key driver for continuing growth
5571182 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5571183 the fade is one of my favorite routes to defend
5571184 going up and fighting for the ball is a lot of fun
5571185 that was a teaching situation and something to learn from
5571186 in order to win you have to eliminate mistakes in critical situations it is a journey we are on we are much better than what we have been in the past but we still have a long way to go
5571187 his legs are a little beat up and sore and a day off wont hurt him
5571188 he had earned a scholarship but didnt do so well academically so we took him off
5571189 his efforts though at practice have earned him a scholarship again

5571193 this is what i have been waiting for forever said azevedo a three time olympian
5571194 was as close to a dysfunctional family as you can find
5571195 they felt like they were outcasts in a way schroeder said
5571196 they felt almost like usa water polo turned its back on them
5571197 that just about killed me he said of the programs loss of prestige
5571198 everybody came out of that saying potentially we can do this schroeder said
5571199 tanked in order to play spain instead of montenegro another water polo power from the former yugoslavia
5571200 everybody knows whats happened said croatia coach ratko rudic whose team probably would have won group b with a serbian victory
5571201 threw a match to face the united states in the semifinals rather than yugoslavia
5571202 when i heard it was brazil i was cheering in doping control
5571203 this team wants to reclaim what we could have gotten
5571204 one of the most amazing things with our team is we dont have that big name player
5571205 that abby wambach that mia hamm that julie foudy people dont really know us
5571206 i think the one thing that we took from that is that its impossible to win a championship if were not on the same page
5571207 it would be arrogant for me to ignore it and say lets move on
5571208 i got five different stories about what happened and i had two questions do you want to win do we need a goalkeeper
5571209 waaaaah our little movie is coming out six months later than the other ones did waaaah
5571210 consejo inversor para el 2 semestre del a o 2008 espero que os sea de provecho
5571211 the fact that people were interested in kansas city indicates this would be a good thing for the city
5571212 our job is to check their qualifications and see what we want to do
5571213 weve had inquiries for over a year obviously we think it would be a major downtown attraction
5571214 theyre grasping at something to attract tenants to a retail center
5571215 were not a big enough community to throw resources around we need to be careful about where we invest our funds as a region we have too much invested in union station and were so close
5571216 we view the aquarium as a science exhibit and since were the premier science museum in the region that exhibit needs to be here
5571217 if the grey skies drizzle and cold winds are making summer even harder to bear fear not because were set for a bank holiday scorcher this months miserable weather looks set to brighten just in time for the long weekend according to forecasters today heavy rain and unseasonably chilly temperatures have made for a miserable august climate so far but the good news is warmer weather is due to set in towards the end of the week
5571218 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5571219 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5571220 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5571221 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5571222 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5571223 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5571224 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5571225 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5571226 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5571227 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5571228 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5571229 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5571230 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5571231 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5571232 it is the spectacle of people who might be different thats all it is
5571233 the tourists appear to have little regard for the neighborhood and its residents and view the stop as akin to visiting a zoo or other attraction where they are entertained by exhibits or animals
5571234 they come down from twin peaks on the way to civic center
5571235 the tour guide told me to stop there for about 20 minutes so they can get out
5571236 many of them seem uncomfortable or shocked by their surroundings
5571237 youve got these throngs of people walking up and down market and 18th holding hands to make it clear that they are heterosexual
5571238 they come in here 15 or 20 at a time
5571239 they look around take a picture and then they walk out in the last three months ive sold one bottle of water it is not worth having so much traffic were not a photo album
5571240 the guy from muni says it is already illegal to park there
5571241 but now he says we have to make it officially illegal its absurd
5571242 they were unhappy with the situation and they wanted it stopped
5571243 well just get the sisters of perpetual indulgence on this
5571244 a few blessings from them and those tour buses would disappear
5571245 need to be prepared to deal with families who are wai
5571246 2 i e multiplied by 2 after the current x value and press enter
5571247 you always like the dress rehearsal to be a scrimmage where were flying around were not making mistakes and were closer to where we want to be before we play michigan state
5571248 were getting close tomorrow is one more opportunity for guys to show what they can do from there we have to create a depth chart because its time to start preparing for michigan state

5571255 now this will have any and every girl in all of south carolina talking for months about the beautiful woman who showed up in this breathtakingly extravagant wedding gown its by gavaline and would look amazing on you
5571256 ill just leave this on the rack here in case you want to have another peek
5571257 oh i agree but i was looking for something a little more like
5571258 behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you
5571259 father i confess that you are the object of my faith you are my shield
5571260 for the lord god is a sun and shield the lord will give grace and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly
5571261 i confess that you are my rock my fortress my deliverer my buckler the horn of my salvation my high tower
5571262 the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my god my strength in whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower
5571263 the lord is good a strong hold in the day of trouble and he knoweth them that trust in him
5571264 thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance
5571265 thou art my hiding place and my shield i hope in thy word
5571266 i confess that you are the strength of my life
5571267 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid
5571268 he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler
5571269 i confess that you position your angels around me to guard me as a shield
5571270 the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them
5571271 for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways
5571272 i confess that the blood of jesus christ is a protective shield about me
5571273 and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death revelation 12 11
5571274 i confess that the victory that overcomes the world is my faith which is a gift from you
5571275 for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith
5571276 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god
5571277 you look great three months in new york was good on you i see

5571285 i am so proud of you you wanted to be a model you went after it and you got it
5571286 mccain may not have been in the cone of silence
5571287 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5571288 mccain may not have been in the cone of silence
5571289 the fact is that during senator obamas segment at saddleback last night senator mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5571290 senator obama what does it mean to you to trust in christ and what does that mean to you on a daily basis what does that really look like
5571291 what does it mean to you to trust in christ
5571292 he had to know that was coming he had to know that was coming that story thats just too pat
5571293 theres some question is mccain really a conservative really a social conservative
5571294 i felt more comfortable with barack obama in terms of his genuine desire to do good
5571295 he was so moved by its power that he got out of bed put on a suit and tie and sat up the rest of the night reading because it would have been an insult to read such an epic in his pajamas
5571296 we dont want it to happen again and disrupt service
5571297 i think it would be a benefit for the public to know when the committee is meeting and to be able to see the information as the committee meets that ultimately will be presented in a report

5571304 its in our neighborhood in a lot of towns thats not the case here theyre amid our homes

5571306 i tell them as soon as you come in im going to bust you
5571307 its our hard earned money thats making those payments not his
5571308 it will be here hun be patient its being worked on in texas
5571309 the way i look at it it just wouldnt be fair to the other guys or to the people who come and see us if i couldnt commit to the music all the way
5571310 right now ive got a calling and if i dont win this election i plan to come back and run in two years
5571311 music will have to wait right now its my family first then the campaign unfortunately music isnt even in the top three in terms of priorities right now

5571318 in tennessee you basically go to the courthouse and sell the property in this situation since there were no bidders the property remains in ms burnettes name
5571319 from this point the caudills will have to move out and its going to be up to ms burnette as to what she wants to do with the property

5571531 we wanted to send a note of appreciation and gratitude to all of you for your messages of support solidarity and sincere empathy as we struggled through the making of our new album declaration a process we detailed publicly back in the beginning of june
5571532 the outpouring of concern and interest from our ardent fans very much helped us through what was a difficult time on the business side of bleeding through
5571533 we felt that you deserved to know what was happening then and similarly we feel that we owe you an explanation as to what is happening right now
5571534 that includes a press campaign with interviews all over the place various promotions some sale pricing at different retailers a video for death anxiety which we are scheduled to shoot this month a licensing deal between trustkill and nuclear blast for the european release of the album and more
5571535 declaration of all of the albums in our catalog is the one that makes us feel the most proud we cant wait for it to hit stores next month so you can all go out and pick up a copy with all of your support of this band its like you all own a little piece of declaration already

5571541 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts this law also gave us the legal right to explore other possible opportunities
5571542 we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here

5571546 i have experienced in the past the great pressure that government officials exert on the athletes as well as the coach and that they demand a gold medal otherwise it is meaningless liu xiang is still a young boy and he has been put under a bit too much expectation

5571549 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers we were the cotton chippers we did all this rural work we were the unskilled labourers in the rural industry
5571550 we created a false economy and then people got used to the idea of staying at home rather than actually going out and looking for work he said
5571551 in other words the requirements that we will put in place will ensure that if there is an australian or someone based in australia who is ready willing and able to work in the horticulture industry then theyll get the jobs first he said macquarie radio in sydney
5571552 were going to review that pilot program halfway through to see whether its a success to whether the requirements weve put in place are working effectively mr smith said
5571553 and if it is successful to see whether it might be sensible to expand the capacity to other areas of australia or indeed to other countries in the pacific
5571554 yet for some inexplicable reason the labor party says the horticultural industry can have workers but the tourism industry cant he said
5571555 we need some clear and specific policy parameters before the opposition can determine whether or not we will support this
5571556 the main difficulty in accepting the implications of our call to be peacemakers is our fear of death and dying born of a weakness of faith
5571557 the gospel is clear and simple and i know what the response to the hitler question must be and i desperately want to avoid this conclusion we must repay evil with good and we must be peacemakers this may also mean as a result that the evildoers will kill us then we shall also die thats it there is nothing else we are called to live the kingdom as he proclaimed it and be his disciples come what may

5571742 with less than a quarter of ells graduati ng after four years it is clear that chancellor joel klein and the department of education must work much much harder if they are serious about ending the ell drop out crisis at this point the city needs to act by initiating large scale interventions across the system to help ell children succeed

5571753 a lack of blockbuster drugs in the pharmaceutical development pipeline along with increasing acceptance of generic drugs by consumers suggests that the low increase we saw during 2007 will be sustained for some time to come
5571754 we are committed to ethical arrangements and ensuring that interactions between industry and health care providers enhance the publics health and foster public confidence unfortunately this legislation would impede important interactions with providers and could drive this critical research and development out of state
5571755 unlike other segments of the health care sector medical technology is often developed and refined based on input from physicians who have direct and constant feedback from their patients training by manufacturers to providers is often critical to the safe use of complex technology
5571756 americas medical device manufacturers believe that patients should have full confidence that the only factor influencing a physicians decision making is the best interests of the patient
5571757 in addition advameds code of ethics adopted in 2003 is tailored to the unique interactions among the medical device industry and health care professionals to preserve ethical collaborations that fuel advances in medical technology and ensure patient access to the most advanced technologies

5571790 truly i say to you it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
5571791 with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible
5571792 we have left everything and followed you what then shall we have
5571793 truly i say to you in the new world when the son of man shall sit on his glorious throne you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel

5571797 the olympic games wont be a watershed for chinas economic growth
5571798 the fundamentals propelling the countrys economic development over the past 30 years will remain even after the games
5571799 it would be a mistake for the world economy and harmful for developing countries not to retrieve it
5571800 there is too much at stake to let this problem derail a global trade package that could expand economic growth and opportunity by cutting subsidies drastically lowering tariffs significantly and opening up services markets
5571801 there is a good doha deal still to be seized
5571802 theres a bit of a down draft from what happened in the us overnight and commodities are a bit weak too
5571803 the chinese stock markets steep losses since the olympics began are also denting sentiment towards heavy industry such as steel makers and shipbuilders there are worries the chinese economy may not grow as robustly after the olympics
5571804 eu autommobile production decreases both gold and platinum continue to be bearish platinum may be below 1 200
5571805 from the charts platinum seemed to have returned the premiums from the earlier south africa crisis and in fact we are almost at one year lows i am looking at the 1 200 1 250 region for support now
5571806 general sentiment for gold remains weak and i guess we are likely to see more selling on strength for near term support i am currently looking at the 770 region
5571807 if we move below that then the 750s will be a very important level to look at
5571808 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5571809 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5571810 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5571811 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
5571812 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again
5571813 the concierge found the property for me with just a click of a mouse there it is they also found the mortgage company they found my lease option tenant they did all the work and we were able to close in our own living room
5571814 we will see a lower opening but i dont really see too much of downside
5571815 the market is taking a breather after the recent upmove and needs some trigger
5571816 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website

5571824 when faced with the worst and best of life people turn to their passion
5571825 when you are happy you write when you are sad you write i bet that when you walk through the effin grocery store youre writing in your head you write lyn thats what you do and its what you have to do if you want to be happy
5571826 we are afraid that if you dont start writing really writing that you are going to fall back into the trap you were in before this started
5571827 first of all patients prefer private rooms when youre sick you like privacy
5571828 most patients dont like having roommates or the visitors that come with them
5571829 hippa health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 regulations require patient privacy too and the private room honors that commitment
5571830 and its rare today that youll find hospitals being built with semi private rooms
5571831 in the task force meetings several months ago we started focusing on trying to get all private rooms for the convenience of the community
5571832 a short time after i joined the district board myself and every other member started pursuing the question of why we were making our patients settle for services in semi private rooms in del rio we encouraged jack houghton to give this some serious consideration and as the task force evolved it became one of the key items that was adopted
5571833 not really but we are reconfiguring each room to have only one bed and some nicer furniture
5571834 we do permit sleepovers in the rooms but i dont want couches there well stay with individual chairs
5571835 weve been working on 2nd station for two years re doing walls and some floors plumbing and electrical lines and connections needed work too anticipating the day when we want to expand that unit
5571836 weve just been using our own workforce for 18 months but the task force agreed that we should accelerate on 2nd station so we can move patients off of 4th station and get started there
5571837 i think well be offering a better service to the community we serve and our patients but well also be able to re convert these rooms quickly in case of an emergency of some sort where we need a lot of beds right away
5571838 in the end were trying to make this the best and most pleasant experience possible for patients
5571839 were already trying to hire more nurses and though were always trying to find and hire more nurses well need even more when this is all done
5571840 this added convenience to the citizens of val verde county has been a long time coming and our entire district board is very glad to see that its finally about to come to fruition

5571843 he has served his sentence and the authorities in vietnam will deport him he does not have any sentence to serve in london if he wants to stop wherever he wants to he can do that
5571844 if he wants to he can change flights he is a free man from today the only problem is the countries he wants to go to because he has to get a visa
5571845 i would hope that the authorities make sure that gary glitter does not slip off to another country
5571846 once youre overseas you can just go from country to country we know that some of the most high risk offenders do that
5571847 glitter is a persistent offender responsible for a catalogue of sexual crimes against children on his return to the uk the authorities must assess the level of risk he poses to children and make sure he is carefully managed and supervised in the community to keep children safe from harm

5571851 what do people mean when they type olympics 2008 asked shashi seth the chief revenue officer of cooliris a menlo park startup whose software lets users preview web links images and 3 d video without clicking on them
5571852 we have completed our preparations and are anxiously waiting for the orders of our chief we can not sit quiet if our innocent brothers sisters and kids are bombed in bajaur agency taliban have also decided to expand their intelligence system to identify people playing spies role and giving reports about the activities of islamic insurgents to the government we will publicly hang those who are acting as spies for the government
5571853 if we are being bombed to appease america we have the right to fight back to defend our ideology
5571854 i suggest to rehman malik to come to swat and lead the operation
5571855 welcome to the nanny state nation where the government minds your own business
5571856 i acknowledge that you are a human and in my presence
5571857 the internet has the potential to fundamentally improve access to care and the company has gained initial traction towards this long term vision
5571858 most strategic plans dont work they involve too much paper too much time too many nodding heads and far too many poorly informed so called experts
5571859 my wife gets a letter there are two individuals in this country illegally using her social security number
5571860 this is absurd and goes against the very moral fiber our country was founded upon
5571861 you have gotten people stirred up by saying the sheriffs office profiles
5571862 i dont know if you do or not sheriff because you telling me you dont i dont know that is true
5571863 but it would be the biggest mistake of his life if he goes on the mound hoping to show the rangers something thats high school stuff
5571864 he is in the top tier of athletics and now hes going to get his tryout as a personality

5571869 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
5571870 old growth now included in old pl timber harvest plans will be taken out of those plans
5571871 mike jani and the company deserve our heartfelt thanks for adopting a more sustainable respectful and we hope restorative kind of forestry
5571872 it feels like going from being considered an environmental terrorist to being a hero in one fell swoop
5571873 this has to be one of the happiest days in my life
5571874 when mrc hrc ceo sandy dean says hrc is going to cut 30 less than pl did that could still be too much
5571875 what we need to look at is rate of harvest compared to their forest inventory
5571876 to make sure they dont clearcut under the guise of variable retention or group selection intensive forestry methods or start spraying herbicides
5571877 time will tell if the company will keep its promises if so it will be a new day for forestry in humboldt county and truly an end to the timber wars as we knew them
5571878 it wouldnt have taken einstein to work out they were holding something like that
5571879 the problem weve got is that we dont know what theyve got because it is such a secretive investigation we dont know what they are holding
5571880 im sure they have got all sorts of things that they are keeping
5571881 why did they criticise that instead of using it as a vehicle to help them
5571882 if they couldnt enhance it why didnt they release it anyway at the time when it was really fresh in peoples minds
5571883 the other thing is that very often someone is keeping a secret and that person may be a wife or a mother but putting that sort of pressure on 12 years ago could well have tipped somebody
5571884 twelve years on that person could be dead they could be divorced it really does beggar belief
5571885 it wouldnt have taken einstein to work out they were holding something like that

5571920 i was impressed by so many entries that expanded the traditional haiku form into longer narrative poems this one stood out simply because i found my mind returning to it for three days the tone and voice is lovely the story is simple and simply told and i love the symmetry although it might be a touch long there are two of my favorite haikus in this one poem no not that long one but there is another one from another time and sometimes randomly people will approach you to practice english the latter one could stand alone i think and i love the intimacy created by the parenthesis
5571921 simple captures a moment without being sentimental also i like that we are left unsure of the relationship and circumstances of the poem
5571922 this one has a nice tricky ending that adds unexpected tension to the verse
5571923 finally i have to give this one a mention im a sucker for onomatopoeia
5571924 this one recalls some of the history of haiku at least the way i understand it in its relationship between humanity and nature and in its witty turn of phrase at the end

5571951 the main difficulty in accepting the implications of our call to be peacemakers is our fear of death and dying born of a weakness of faith

5572127 courtenay met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
5572128 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5572129 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5572130 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5572131 lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
5572132 she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5572133 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her
5572134 i think perhaps she was shocked and didnt know what to say
5572135 shes representative of what happens to the patients we see
5572136 a lot of the patients we see think theyre going crazy
5572137 its appropriate for doctors to ask about stress the mistake is to assume thats what it is

5572209 ever since the federal circuit has been fashioning the contours of its new approach to declaratory judgment jurisdiction in cases including
5572210 no definite and concrete dispute that touches the legal relations of these parties
5572211 the dispute must be definite and concrete touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests real and substantial and admi t of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts
5572212 did not completely do away with the relevance of a reasonable apprehension of suit
5572213 one of multiple ways that a declaratory judgment plaintiff can satisfy the more general all the circumstances test
5572214 a controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality to create a justiciable controversy
5572215 the mere existence of a potentially adverse party does not by itself cause an injury or create an imminent risk of injury
5572216 potential competitor legally free to market its product in the face of an adversely held patent
5572217 although medimmune clarified that an injury in fact sufficient to create an actual controversy can exist even when there is no apprehension of suit it did not change the bedrock rule that a case or controversy must be based on a real and immediate injury or threat of future injury that is caused by the defendants an objective standard that cannot be met by a purely subjective or speculative fear of future harm
5572218 there is no limit to what a man can do if he doesnt care who gets the credit
5572219 i told my staff were going to find an entirely different offset because weve got to make sure that the money going into nasa for basic research and development continues to go there
5572220 i know that earlier this year senator obama proposed cutting the nasa budget and delaying the timetable for our return to the moon and the mars mission
5572221 i believe that he later repudiated his own plan sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5572222 let me say just in case senator obama does decide to return to his original plan of cutting nasa funding
5572223 that position is a shortsighted approach that fails to recognize the benefits of space exploration and the technology and economic advantages that result from the space program

5572236 this morning tuesday we recovered a body of a seven year old his father was brutally killed yesterday what they did was inhuman the boys stomach was open

5572240 i just like to go under there to get my focus and concentrate

5572247 utterly baseless charge that is just a pretext to prevent him from posting more articles critical of the government
5572248 dieu cay posted articles criticizing chinas policy in the south china sea where both the chinese and vietnamese governments claim sovereignty over the spratly and paracel islands
5572249 the vietnamese authorities are copying their chinese neighbors both as regards internet filtering and harassment of internet users we call for dieu cays release
5572250 everyone will understand why liu xiang had to abandon competition due to injury
5572251 there is basically no worry about top spot on the gold medal table
5572252 if we should be able to play close from the beginning for sure yao ming should play a longer time but there was no reason to keep him on the court
5572253 yao fought he wants to play and wants to help us as much as possible but he is a player and i am the coach i make those decisions
5572254 i talked with him only a moment and what he said i could not print in the press
5572255 you could say he was not happy at all with jonas
5572256 we played lithuania when i was chinas assistant coach in athens 2004 i know those guys and this is my job we have to do as best as possible
5572257 hey ill be back early next month im planning to make a trip to langkawi you interested
5572258 we have been hiring and adding to the staff over the past five years and have just gotten to the point here at the milestone location were just bursting at the seams so it was time to look at a new area new location for us
5572259 because it gives an opportunity for a hundred new people to be downtown in addition it allows us to partner with our local financial office thats right downtown
5572260 from the employee standpoint theres a lot of things for them to do and see and places to go so its just a great opportunity for us
5572261 obviously well see some benefit to the hospitality restaurant businesses as well as the retail
5572262 these are folks that are typically not used to having this much around them and i think theyre very excited about coming down
5572263 he had called her on her cell phone to come by and pick up some money and made the statement if the door is locked just break out the window which is very odd
5572264 he tried to say there were intruders in his house even pretending at first that he didnt know who he had shot just that there were 2 people in his house trying to break in and hed shot them
5572265 i think he knew they were coming i think he waited on them and i think he ambushed them
5572266 its unusual for this town not much goes in here because its pretty well patrolled its quiet up here
5572267 what the heck is this photoshop world thing you keep harping about
5572268 the problem now is that i need airfare and hotel a nice roommate would help want to go to vegas next month
5572269 there are 15 people all with the same substance this is the strangest thing because it leads to the conclusion that there is an organised effort
5572270 there is an organized crime because that is what this is called because it seems there is a lot of money hidden there a lot of profit
5572271 i am neither a policeman nor a detective nor a judge i dont have that knowledge and i think that the time has come for the state to do something and find a solution i believe that if they want to they will find it and i believe they do want to
5572272 i dont talk about dead people whoever does such things gets mixed up in such things commits suicide and when someone wants to commit suicide nobody can stop them
5572273 im coming down to shake this young mans hand in full public gaze
5572274 time place and circumstance are the gifts to our talents
5572275 those of us who have made it to the top of the victory stand know that we didnt do it alone a rival is just as important as a coach however when the fierce days of competition are over it is the friendships forged through mutual respect that count the most
5572276 the air med plane was scheduled to arrive at 5 00pm it blew out to 7 30pm and its around 7 00pm or just after 7 00pm that the patient passed away
5572277 its not the primary cause of death but it basically means that he would have been able to get into the hospital environment
5572278 well there was a delay in retrieval ive received a brief on that but i suppose the bottom line is that the gentleman died and thats very sad and my commiserations to his family and to the community but commendation to the health clinic who really tried to resuscitate him
5572279 according to people close to it that death may have been caused by may have been avoidable if the system had have been better
5572280 we live in a situation where we have many many people in remote situations where we cannot provide service on the ground and we need to have a very effective and timely evacuation service so these people can live with the security that they can get access to health care as it is needed
5572281 we are spending a huge amount of money on maintenance on insuring our rolling stock and the rails and the overhead wiring are set up for the future
5572282 we are working as hard as we can to improve the situation and statistics show that in fact is happening
5572283 i think he has been extremely rude in the way hes treated john sanderson and the excellent recommendations that hes made
5572284 indigenous and non indigenous children can share the same birthday but not the same life span and that gap in life expectancy and it exists of course not just in victoria but in every state and territory is of course completely unacceptable
5572285 the social and economic disadvantage confronted by indigenous communities has of course been decades in the making and such disadvantage cannot be undone overnight

5572287 my father was always more concerned with how i behaved on the golf course than anything else

5572289 yes physically it would be nice if he were here and involved but i never had to play golf to please my dad never had to win tournaments or majors to make him happy or justify anything
5572290 he had his own career and he never lived through me

5572292 its all about me playing my game if tigers here and he plays better than me ill shake his hand and say well done but i cant play against one player theres no point in doing that

5572295 my father was always more concerned with how i behaved on the golf course than anything else

5572311 weve been hearing a lot about android recently from delayed release dates to a video claiming to depict the fabled htc dream in action what we havent heard however is anything specific about the public availability of the first android devices to hit the streets htc and t mobile have been promising an android based device by the end of this year but havent gone any further into the specifics tmonews is now claiming that the htc dream will in fact be the first android device to reach our hands the site is reporting that t mobile will begin offering the dream via a special promotional pre sale event beginning september 17th which is just over a month from now the device will reportedly cost 150 for current t mobile subscribers though it could sell for as much as 399 when it goes on sale to the general public some time later
5572312 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived

5572324 unless human reasoning is valid no science can be true it follows that no account of the universe can be true unless that account leaves it possible for our thinking to be a real insight a theory which explained everything else in the whole universe but which made it impossible to believe our thinking was valid would be utterly out of court for that theory itself would have been arrived at by thinking and if thinking is not valid that theory would of course be itself demolished it would have destroyed its own credentials it would be an argument which proved no argument was sound a proof that there are no such things as proofs which is nonsense
5572325 my father is always at his work to this very day and i too am working
5572326 the reason my father loves me is that i lay down my life only to take it up again no one takes it from me but i lay it down of my own accord i have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again this command i received from my father

5572331 the farmers ive worked with have not been able to equal yields with organic methods in all cases
5572332 corporate interest in agriculture and the way agriculture research has been conducted in land grant institutions with a lot of influence by the chemical companies and pesticide companies as well as fertilizer companies all have been playing an important role in convincing the public that you need to have these inputs to produce food she said
5572333 could produce enough food on a global per capita basis to sustain the current human population and potentially an even larger population without increasing the agricultural land base
5572334 organic agriculture has the potential to contribute quite substantially to the global food supply
5572335 organic methods could produce enough food on a global per capita basis to sustain the current human population and potentially an even larger population without increasing the agricultural land base
5572336 grain output and food per capita in the project area have increased greatly because of improved crops varieties runoff harvesting and water saving irrigation and fertilizers and pesticide use
5572337 my hope is that we can finally put a nail in the coffin of the idea that you cant produce enough food through organic agriculture
5572338 global dataset of 293 examples yet there are numerous instances of repeated counting of yields from the same long term studies
5572339 no significant difference in tomato yields among the different systems

5572356 to serve the housing needs of our students buckingham college should build a new dormitory buckinghams enrollment is growing and based on current trends should double over the next fifty years thus making existing dormitories inadequate moreover the average rent for an apartment in our town has increased in recent years consequently students will find it increasingly difficult to afford off campus housing finally an attractive new dormitory would make prospective students more likely to enroll at buckingham

5572358 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5572359 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5572360 to help you take advantage of virtualization technologies microsoft is updating its software licensing policies for server applications with the changes both licenses and software can move more freely across servers in a server farm potentially reducing the number of licenses needed to support your workloads
5572361 effectively the changes mean instead of counting instances or processors and licensing by server you are able to count instances or processors and license by server farm this is accomplished by allowing customers to reassign licenses freely across servers within a server farm
5572362 if you have not heard the microsoft licensing team has announced new ways for you to take advantage of virtualization technologies by reassigning licenses across servers within a server farm
5572363 changes apply to software licenses for certain server applications and all external connector ec licenses
5572364 it does not apply to licenses acquired through other retail sources

5572370 if i somehow play well enough to win that will be huge
5572371 given there has been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted
5572372 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5572373 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5572374 weighing up all these considerations members judged that the current stance of policy was appropriate for the time being
5572375 nonetheless given the slower trend in demand scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing
5572376 broader measures that included job advertisements on the internet were also softening and employment intentions from a range of business surveys suggested employment growth would moderate in the period ahead
5572377 the first amendment does not require students to leave their religion at the schoolhouse door it is especially important that parents feel confident that their children can practice religion we need to make it easier and more acceptable for people to express and to celebrate their faith
5572378 if students can wear t shirts advertising sports teams rock groups or politicians they can also wear t shirts that promote religion religion is too important to our history and our heritage for us to keep it out of our schools nothing in the first amendment converts our public schools into religion free zones or requires all religious expression to be left behind at the schoolhouse door
5572379 governments schools also may not discriminate against private religious expression during the school day

5572394 liu xiang used to be and still is a hero in my mind but there is the only regret before liu xiang went out of the
5572395 we cannot accept the fact that liu xiang quits liu xiang dispels all the passion of chinese people
5572396 he is under too much pressure he was afraid of failure i know there is another athlete from cuba who runs also very fast if liu was going to lose he would lose everything chinese people put too much attention on him i wonder if he was injured why didnt he quit the competition previously why those doctors still let him compete maybe i am wrong its a pity
5572397 i really thought that liu xiang could take less time to engage in advertisement and spend more time in training in reality you are flying 1 3 billion people

5572406 my son has pretty much grown up with these people theyre like family to him we have to keep it going
5572407 if they cancel it wed have to find another way to get together and support cher
5572408 and weve become lifelong friends so well always find a way to keep in touch
5572409 you better call him and tell him to get here now
5572410 damn my head hurts walk around my house naked what holy rusted metal batman ive never walked naked around my house when its empty except that one time when my clothes ended up on the other end of the room
5572411 i was sad because i could not win gold medal for the country many would have been disappointed with the manner i lost but from the welcome i received today i felt as though i had won the gold medal
5572412 i am glad that the nation is still supportive of me despite my defeat
5572413 this means a lot to me it will only spur me on to work even harder to achieve more good results for the country
5572414 there were days that i could not sleep and there were days when i had no appetite to eat the pressure was great but i have no excuse for the defeat lin dan was so fast he had improved so much
5572415 the next two major tournaments are the world championships 2009 and the asian games 2010 with the help of my coach misbun sidek i will be ready for these tournaments
5572416 but like china i hope that there will be more than one malaysian singles player vying for honours in these tournaments it helps when one can support the other just like the players from china
5572417 the training will be tougher from now for chong wei i want to get him ready for the next olympics at the same my work will start immediately to groom other olympians this will be my challenge
5572418 working as a board member of a residents association here is a fresh experience and i do not feel bothered at all
5572419 because japanese residents seemed to like living quietly i thought they would feel bothered if i talked to them
5572420 it has made it easier for foreign households who do not have japanese speaking members to join community life
5572421 id gotten away from it the last couple of weeks but a big part of my game is going up the middle and the other way
5572422 id gotten a little pull happy and we worked today on staying back out over the middle i definitely wasnt trying to hit home runs that way but thats usually what happens when youre trying to keep it simple
5572423 to be honest it didnt even occur to me we were on the road
5572424 they told me when we came here it was going to be that way but its something im definitely not accustomed to its a neat little experience
5572425 you take one step and it almost feels like a little shock going up your back
5572426 the short answer is that i dont think its any one thing
5572427 i think its a combination of elements that have contributed to some inconsistency
5572428 hes still our ace no doubt about it hes still our no 1 starting pitcher and thats not to diminish what daisuke matsuzaka and stats have done this year but we still look at josh as the leader of our pitching staff
5572429 i think if theres one comparison between this year and last year his command of the bottom of the strike zone was more consistent last year than it has been this year
5572430 you gotta keep playing man you gotta make sure youre in the postseason
5572431 besides manny delcarmen walking two in the eighth i thought we played a real good game
5572432 youve got a guy hitting cleanup so we dont want to just take the bat out of his hands youd like to get the runner over and in that was a good piece of hitting
5572433 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5572434 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5572435 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things

5572450 as the dust settles from the breakdown of the wto negotiations in geneva some parties are recognising that there was a good package of results left on the table zoellick said
5572451 it would be a mistake for the world economy and harmful for developing countries not to retrieve it
5572452 given the high food prices around the world and the need for poor people to lower their cost of food it just does not make sense for the doha negotiations to founder upon this barrier
5572453 since the purpose of a safeguard is to help cushion the effect of a significant increase in imports on local producers an acceptable justification for the safeguard could require examination of factors in addition to increased trade flows
5572454 a big problem with safeguards is that once a country triggers them it can take two years or more to challenge the grounds for imposing them he said
5572455 in the meantime the new barriers block trade so a compromise could create a speedy due process for challenges without appeal
5572456 it may be understandable that tired negotiators couldnt assemble these and perhaps other variables in a way to solve the problem zoellick said
5572457 nifty may test 4320 levels today banking stocks are likely to lead the resurgence in market

5572467 youre cool and all for a counselor but if you ever stepped in our hood wed probably kill you
5572468 however my problem is that it doesnt look like that many people want to heal in my experience healers are almost always the bottleneck in recruiting and they burn out the fastest then the top tier guilds recruit healers from the lower tier guilds and that means the lower tier guilds have even harder time picking up new healers the basic fact is that the number of healers blizzard wants to balance around simply does not match the number of players willing to heal that contributes to the instability of raiding and makes it harder for people to actually raid
5572469 i just really enjoy the interaction with the residents and the staff
5572470 were a very solid organization heading in a good direction
5572471 i like the ability to be a part of their lives and make a positive impact

5572476 they figure this is the weekend i took off and by god im going to climb that mountain
5572477 people dont start the day thinking oh im going to get hurt
5572478 they might not have the proper equipment and they underestimate how difficult the white mountains can be theyre starting from the valley where its 80 degrees theyre in shorts and t shirts and they get up high and theres sleet its a really different world
5572479 the problem with the one is unlike contests for singing or dancing there is no such thing as physic powers so really it is a test between people who are able to do cold readings and cold readings is literally being able to read somebody
5572480 so really these are just actors faking and pretending to be psychic its actually quite funny how they allegedly do all the things they claim to do
5572481 individually we are pattern seeking primates who look for connections and love to tell stories its all part of learning
5572482 our brains by default believe things are real and we dont seem to have a mechanism to switch that off because learning is so important after all there is no harm in believing these things you wont get killed
5572483 in the case of bigfoot i say show me the body anybody can doctor a photograph
5572484 there is already very strong interest around the topic of scepticism in australia and i hope to meet with some of the local sceptics groups there as well as inspire more people to question some of the popular myths we are encouraged to believe

5572486 the other thing i really like about seeds of change is just in how the book is available and marketed you can read three full length stories as well as many
5572487 this book is an excellent learning tool like any other tool you get out of it exactly what you put in my advice is to spend as much time with each section as you need if you do that you will walk away with every bit of the knowledge an industry thought leader can provide
5572488 you know what to be honest i come to the ballpark i dont ask about joe crede

5572500 i used to always talk to him after games thats gone for the first time and im playing in the united states for the first time in that sense i feel like im playing a different kind of baseball
5572501 i probably gave him the impression that i wanted to play for the sake of playing
5572502 he told me to not play if i wasnt going to take it seriously
5572503 if something like that happened now itd probably be a problem

5572520 im like a kid in a candy store the buckeyes keep me young and they keep me screaming
5572521 being in the stadium is like eating an entire chocolate cake without getting sick its unbelievable and indescribable
5572522 im just in love with the buckeyes but tickets are impossible to get
5572523 so quite frankly ive been counting down for months waiting for this event where i have a chance to see my boys up close and personal
5572524 his other uncle is a michigan fan so this is my way to edge that other team out of his mind plus this is sort of a trial run to see if hes ready for me to take him to a real game
5572525 for the rest of our lives football will be our father and son time he already recognizes the stadium theres nothing like seeing the bucks first hand and thats something i want to let him experience
5572526 being an ohio state fan is part of being in our family
5572527 to be here with my entire family for the first time is certainly exciting
5572528 all i know is that i want ohio to kick michigans butt and i need them to win a national championship sometime soon really soon
5572529 you read about the new players and hear about them but this is our first chance to actually see them in action i want to see what these freshmen are all about especially terrelle pryor
5572530 we came to see a great football game theres nothing better
5572531 im just glad theyre willing to let the past be the past and give him a chance i just hope that the cincinnati fans will give him the same type of chance
5572532 i just have to be smart and handle myself like a professional at all times
5572533 i dont think it would be productive for our football team

5572539 i want to come out and make sure the shoulder is healthy i also want to swing the bat well and have a good september
5572540 no worries about a flat start with notre dame coming to town the hyped showdown between willingham and his former school and former genius coach charlie weis isnt much of a game as the huskies sack jimmy clausen five times in a 31 17 win

5572570 and its not just us we get a lot of business from these campgrounds around here and people dont want to come out because the lake is low so people arent spending money at wal mart theyre not going out to eat theyre not going to movies at exit 7 theyre not spending money in the tri cities
5572571 it hurts lake travel with low water levels people are afraid to take their boat out for fear of hurting it
5572572 last year we had a severe drought no rainfall at all for months i understand that this year weve had some rain and its lake dropped more than it did last year
5572573 since february of 2007 we have operated at minimum flows from south holston
5572574 weve taken only enough water to meet our downstream commitments were keeping as much in reserve as possible
5572575 were doing the minimum power generation in a typical year you do more than the minimum that is the least we can do and meet our downstream obligations its one thing to do the minimums for a few months at a time were coming into the third year of doing minimums
5572576 were about 5 09 inches below normal rainfall last year we were about 22 inches below normal so were still about 2 feet below normal
5572577 the average for all 10 is 14 feet below target levels
5572578 boone was very very slow to fill this year but we took no water to fill boone there was a great deal of anxiety about how long it did take boone to fill
5572579 we received repeated requests to pull water out of south holston and watauga to fill boone but we responded we dont do that and we didnt do that
5572580 south holston is the first reservoir in the system so there is no upstream resource
5572581 we tried to look at it where we could hold more water in the project south holston to support recreation
5572582 ja das haben wir uns sicherlich ganz anders vorgestellt ein 0 3 zur halbzeit war bestimmt nicht unser ziel
5572583 to have a specified site they can talk to the red sox about that is a big step

5572593 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5572594 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana

5572598 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5572599 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5572600 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5572601 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5572602 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5572603 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5572604 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5572605 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5572606 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5572607 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5572608 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche

5572611 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5572612 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5572613 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n

5572630 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5572631 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5572632 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

5572640 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5572641 sinofresh nasal spray used three times daily appeared to effectively eliminate mrsa in the noses of the test animals while leaving enough normal microbes to keep a normal population in the nasal passages
5572642 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5572643 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

5572647 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5572648 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5572649 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5572650 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5572651 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5572652 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5572653 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5572654 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5572655 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5572656 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5572657 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5572658 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5572659 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5572660 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5572661 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5572662 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5572663 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5572664 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5572665 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5572666 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5572667 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5572668 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5572669 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5572670 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5572671 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5572672 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5572673 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5572674 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5572675 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5572676 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5572677 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5572678 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5572679 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5572680 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5572681 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5572682 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5572683 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5572684 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5572685 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente

5572693 doctors might soon be able to regrow injured muscles tendons and bones without invasive surgery simply by injecting a persons own stem cells into the site of an injury veterinarians are already doing it with injured horses and research into human applications is well under way
5572694 the national institutes for health seem to think regenerating human muscle and bone using a persons own adult stem cells is nearly ready for prime time
5572695 researchers at the nih labs in bethesda maryland are already growing human muscle cartilage and spinal disks in vitro the tissue isnt mechanically sound yet says lead researcher rocky tuan but that will come with further work

5572697 hello all this is a little story i came up from based on some actual insomnia induced hallucinations
5572698 thanks for the help guys oh and by the way you kind of cocked up our case
5572699 but i have this gut feeling that xiang might not actually be an fbi agent
5572700 the fully operational cold fusion reactor the cloning facility the wormhole to mars the psyker holding pens and the court of emperor norton i
5572701 he might meuroize everybody who reads this awsome comic strip and make them forget that we ever read this awsome piece of work
5572702 the military will continue to fight and the political government will continue to negotiate the negotiations have to continue as it is now an issue of saving pakistani society from the hands of the taliban
5572703 it has very fragile public support it doesnt want to lose that public support by going hard after the militants but at the same time it knows it must do so
5572704 this is a positive change but it is just the beginning
5572705 if the government ends these policies the taliban will stop their activities immediately
5572706 you go five feet then kink it drops almost straight down about 60 degrees
5572707 its like going down roller coaster a just hang on kind of thing
5572708 anyone here who tells you they havent crashed is a liar
5572709 in other races there are plenty of opportunities for guys to pay you back
5572710 but were not a bunch of punk kids riding around town vandalizing stuff
5572711 i like to sing and dance thats who i am thats my personality
5572712 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
5572713 if anyone thinks he can kill our citizens without being punished or kill our soldiers and officers who are peacekeepers we will never allow this
5572714 we are talking about pulling back to the territory of south ossetia there should be no troops on the territory of georgia
5572715 we used to have there one light infantry battalion less than 600 people certainly it will be more soldiers but not just soldiers the force must be credible to prevent any further escalation of conflict there
5572716 lets then start thinking negotiating how can we prevent the definitive estrangement of our two countries
5572717 at some time it will be necessary to choose between supporting this virtual project and a real partnership on questions which actually require collective action
5572718 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
5572719 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
5572720 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbour occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
5572721 this arsenal has to be defused of course so that it cannot pose any threat to civilians
5572722 the european union cannot be indifferent to this war these massacres on our doorstep
5572723 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5572724 the settling any international ethnic or external territorial disputes by peaceful means
5572725 we dont know exactly what the package is going to be this a menu of things
5572726 their model is in line with companies like us we want to keep things as simple as possible and keep costs as low as possible
5572727 theyre in the phase where theyre getting big customers if they do well with the rollouts theyll get the attention of a lot of mainstream corporations
5572728 workday is like the ipod for enterprise hr software its a better and simpler way of doing things and people can see it
5572729 twenty customers does not a success make you have to be ready to put 10 years into this deal
5572730 the big problem is theyve been at the demands of wall street for so long to continually increase sales and increase the rate quarter over quarter
5572731 you cant even get a light bulb changed without putting in a work order
5572732 unfortunately a close inspection of obamas proposals reveals something disquieting he would raise marginal tax rates for many middle income taxpayers a bad move for anyone seeking to promote economic growth
5572733 the key point that brill and viard neglect to note or discuss is that even in their cherry picked example higher marginal tax rates bring along offsetting benefits to families with lower and middle incomes
5572734 virtually the whole government debt story is due to projections of exploding health care costs
5572735 is at least in part due to the cratering of the highway trust fund which is fueled by the gas tax overspending in previous years coupled with the precipitous drop in gas tax receipts as motorists drive less has drained the fund and well for earmark spending
5572736 so any earmark reductions we are seeing in august are likely to be negated by an avalanche of earmarks that always accompanies major omnibus spending bills
5572737 the idea that apple can choose what functionality my applications should have frightens me
5572738 how about legislation that requires a mandatory kill switch be integrated into every human being so that the police can kill an individual without even needing to dispatch an officer to a scene
5572739 this helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites products and internet services are of most interest to them
5572740 thats the holy grail by continually monitoring how consumers are using the phone they are able to be super responsive to glitches
5572741 we apologize to asian people if they were offended spain is one of the most multicultural countries in the world maybe some people in spain come through like that but in england or the u s they have the same problem we dont feel we did something bad its wrong to interpret it as racist
5572742 broadband on the move is bringing about a change in consumer behaviour the days of the internet being something for the home are over for a growing number of savvy shoppers the online and in store worlds have merged
5572743 people want fit for purpose content many businesses are in danger of being caught on the hop
5572744 the moderation and virtue of a single character probably prevented this revolution from being closed as most other have been by a subversion of that liberty it was intended to establish

5572751 transantiago es un fracaso el gobierno cada seis meses tiene que ir al congreso a pedir plata y esa plata a lo mejor puede ser ocupada en otras cosas en hospitales educaci n
5572752 la posibilidad de que el sector no necesite ayuda o plata para mantener el transantiago o sea el transantiago muri volver al sistema antiguo con algunas mejoras lo que es la tarjeta bip y sacarlos del problema
5572753 le abitudini di pagamento e i rischi connessi al mancato recupero dei crediti sono stati messi sotto la lente

5572760 this was clearly a child that was determined to somehow leave the home of her father which to police she described as hell senior judge trafford walker said
5572761 over a number of years we have welcomed the commitment and co operation of the chinese authorities in tackling imitation products passed off as scotch whisky in china
5572762 this positive decision to grant stronger collective trademark protection to scotch is an important advance and will help to ensure chinese consumers and scottish distillers are protected from fake products
5572763 it is not rocket science here we could actually move aboriginal people across into these jobs he said to abc television
5572764 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers we were the cotton chippers we did all this rural work we were the unskilled labourers in the rural industry
5572765 we created a false economy and then people got used to the idea of staying at home rather than actually going out and looking for work he said
5572766 in other words the requirements that we will put in place will ensure that if there is an australian or someone based in australia who is ready willing and able to work in the horticulture industry then theyll get the jobs first he said macquarie radio in sydney
5572767 were going to review that pilot program halfway through to see whether its a success to whether the requirements weve put in place are working effectively mr smith said
5572768 and if it is successful to see whether it might be sensible to expand the capacity to other areas of australia or indeed to other countries in the pacific
5572769 yet for some inexplicable reason the labor party says the horticultural industry can have workers but the tourism industry cant he said
5572770 we need some clear and specific policy parameters before the opposition can determine whether or not we will support this
5572771 i cannot believe you can truthfully say the people of this town want red light cameras

5572774 these condition are expected to lead to higher levels of virus activity and greater exposure of humans to the viruses prof dunstan said
5572775 however australia has a number of other viral pathogens with the potential to threaten the safety of the blood supply such as the ross river barmah forrest kunjin japanese encephalitis murray valley encephalitis and dengue viruses prof dunstan said
5572776 the risk of emergence of transfusion transmissible infectious diseases emphasises the need for countries to work together to help each other maintain their blood supplies during epidemics and pandemics the researchers wrote in their report
5572777 this is particularly important should a major infectious disease pandemic occur in different countries at different times
5572778 john made a terrible mistake in 2006 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
5572779 our family has been through a lot some caused by nature some caused by human weakness and some most recently caused by the desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences none of these has been easy but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
5572780 2006 date and how it plays a role in the edwards narrative regarding the affair

5572809 board of trustees cease its involvement in college and district operations and delegate all non policy issues and policy implementation at the district and college level
5572810 leadership of the college governance groups including the board of trustees work together to clarify document and communicate the processes used for campus decision making especially in such areas as planning and the allocation of resources
5572811 there is a serious lack of opportunity for meaningful participation in the decision making process at the college
5572812 resulting climate on campus seriously compromises the colleges ability to meet several accreditation standards
5572813 in order to meet the standards the team recommends that the college through the leadership of the president establish a climate of empowerment innovation and collaboration resulting in a decision making process that provides for a substantial voice for faculty and middle managers and meaningful input for students and staff in areas that reflect their responsibility the team further recommends that processes for decision making be regularly evaluated to assure their integrity and effectiveness

5572832 if they dont ask for what they need how can we even know what it is it sounds to me as though they must be coping perfectly fine if they arent calling us or asking for more prayer they have their faith and that should be enough during the dark moments to carry them through
5572833 if we provided a van for transportation to church events would it increase your attendance if our service was online as a web cast would you listen or watch it when you were too ill to attend do you know who to contact at our church if you have personal needs for personal assistance especially when your condition is chronic not acute would having the song lyrics available on paper be easier for you to see than just having the overhead how could we make the service more comfortable for you for example are the seats comfortable

5572869 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5572870 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5572871 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5572872 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5572873 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5572874 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5572875 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5572876 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5572877 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5572878 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5572879 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5572880 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5572881 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5572882 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5572883 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5572884 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5572885 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5572886 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5572887 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5572888 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5572889 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5572890 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5572891 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5572892 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5572893 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5572894 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5572895 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5572896 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5572897 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5572898 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5572899 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5572900 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5572901 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5572902 it was getting tight after that last swing so i put gabe kapler in there
5572903 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5572904 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5572905 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5572906 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5572907 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5572908 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5572909 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5572910 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5572911 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5572912 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5572913 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5572914 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5572915 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5572916 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5572917 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5572918 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5572919 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5572920 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5572921 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5572922 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5572923 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5572924 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5572925 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5572926 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5572927 eu autommobile production decreases both gold and platinum continue to be bearish platinum may be below 1 200
5572928 from the charts platinum seemed to have returned the premiums from the earlier south africa crisis and in fact we are almost at one year lows i am looking at the 1 200 1 250 region for support now
5572929 general sentiment for gold remains weak and i guess we are likely to see more selling on strength for near term support i am currently looking at the 770 region
5572930 if we move below that then the 750s will be a very important level to look at
5572931 sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices and weaker growth in exports
5572932 although the economy is under no pressure to adjust production capacity and labor these downside risks to the economy demand attention
5572933 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5572934 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to us 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at us 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues

5573006 we will continue with the operations it will not stop with the clearing of the areas occupied by them
5573007 we cannot forever take the convenient excuse from the hierarchy of a group that is supposedly talking peace with the government
5573008 it is their responsibility if they are really sincere and well meaning to rein in their forces
5573009 beginning to walk but by no means were they running
5573010 if that was a us brigade it would not have gone into combat
5573011 from what ive heard a lot of the 4th brigade was hit pretty hard
5573012 some of the soldiers seemed really grateful for the things we taught them
5573013 come from the hills of georgia and some of them sign for their paycheck with an x
5573014 overall goal is to bring georgia up to nato standards
5573015 i know specifically that bravo company im sure and i hope from what i did for them that theyre better off than they would have been if this happened four weeks ago
5573016 it was not an absolutely decisive factor whether georgians were trained by americans or not
5573017 what happened was due to the political decision of georgian authorities and not the performance on the ground
5573018 there is no question that the jury selection process is often pressured and difficult and we have no reason to doubt the desire and good faith attempts of the judge and all the attorneys in the case to conduct the process in a manner that was fair to all concerned however the defendant has an unquestionable right to be tried before a jury that has been selected in a manner that is free from discrimination and this right was not adequately protected in the present case
5573019 by approving of the peremptory challenge the judge here found the prosecutors stated reasons to be credible
5573020 mayor robert correia and state rep michael rodrigues will jointly cut the ribbon on the watuppa shoreline
5573021 the goal of the event is to alert the general public to the new path which runs from the westport line near lepages on route 6 to brayton avenue near where the quequechan river begins
5573022 we expect the path to become popular we hope that the path will be fall rivers first step to a path through the city the current path though short does bypass one of the worst stretches of route 6 and should allow more people to bike to work
5573023 i am deeply troubled by this matter and understand how devastating the announcement of it is to the brazilian community and to the st pius x parish community
5573024 i wish to assure all of you of my prayers at this difficult time i ask that you remember father lima and the individual who has brought forth this accusation in your prayers
5573025 he was certainly somebody who was dedicated to his ministry and the people he ministered to
5573026 it is good to see a good vision for the future where all social segments are together
5573027 if you decide not to go this route you enter the bidding process and have to hire a consultant
5573028 a consultant is going to cost the town anywhere between 5 000 and 15 000 to find out that you are going to have to spend another 10 000 to 20 000 on a phone system when it is all said and done
5573029 this is all about improving customer service at town hall and giving the employees the technology they deserve to do their jobs
5573030 right now every department has a separate answering machine and some work better than others i think that when someone leaves a message at town hall they should get a return call in a timely fashion
5573031 theyre on it all the time but they dont actually know whats inside it
5573032 it goes more in depth on the computer hard drive
5573033 once they start learning in high school they know a little bit about it because they learned it here
5573034 i hope there is good public turnout and obviously i hope they decide on the side of energy conservation and money conservation
5573035 if you know you have to be sober then you will come sober
5573036 the students were very adamant about the use of the breathalyzer as a deterrent
5573037 it needs to be done unless something otherwise tells us differently
5573038 we have used them and they have been a tremendous help in resolving the issue of whether someone has been drinking or not
5573039 we have had very few questions from parents and the kids have accepted the requirement without any difficulty
5573040 since we breathalyze every student it definitely has been effective in curtailing drinking before events and we certainly plan to continue using the machines
5573041 i come from a long line of police officers and firefighters
5573042 were seeing it later than we have in the past few years when weve had human cases
5573043 but nonethless there is eastern equine encephalitis virus out there now so there really is a risk that people could be exposed
5573044 now is not a good time to sell a house
5573045 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5573046 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5573047 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5573048 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5573049 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5573050 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5573051 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5573052 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5573053 itll be one of the slowest days of the year and i think it just kind of fed into itself
5573054 the degree and depth of whats happening in the financial industry is beyond anything weve seen in decades and it takes time to get your arms around the severity of whats happening and what the long term and short term ramifications are
5573055 when you set traps and get 1 000 1 500 like we did over the weekend thats a serious condition
5573056 i think were all a little frustrated that theres not more we can do
5573057 this isnt quite as easy as lets put a plane up and we can get rid of all the rules and regulations
5573058 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5573059 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5573060 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5573061 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5573062 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5573063 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5573064 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5573065 pakistan and the united states have a joint interest in fighting terror
5573066 thats what were concentrating on that and helping pakistan to sustain its economy to build its schools its health we have a broad pakistan policy
5573067 con fecha de 1 de enero y hasta el 30 de junio del presente a o a pesar de la mala situaci n econ mica las pernoctaciones en la costa del sol aumentaron un 6
5573068 dentro del sector existe un ambiente de total serenidad y calma gracias a la efectividad en la actuaci n de los cuerpos de seguridad del estado
5573069 m laga ya ha recuperado la normalidad y la playa de guadalmar se encuentra a pleno rendimiento y por lo tanto no existe ninguna raz n por la cual no debamos seguir con la normalidad existente antes del aviso de bomba
5573070 este hecho pone de relevancia que el momento actual el que se encuentra el sector es el de total confianza y tranquilidad
5573071 ejemplo de ello es la llegada del ave a m laga
5573072 ofrece una imagen de fortaleza a la costa del sol por la llegada de un mayor n mero de turistas que hasta el momento no se hab an planteado este destino
5573073 hemos analizado la cualificaci n del sector para extenderlo a los diferentes actores de la costa del sol para que exista una mayor oferta y de calidad
5573074 si no empiezan las precipitaciones significativas a principios de oto o
5573075 en cuanto vi las llamas lo primero que se me vino a la cabeza era que ya hab an atentado aqu en mijas los terroristas con estas cosas nunca se sabe lo que puede ocurrir
5573076 gracias a la r pida actuaci n de los bomberos podemos decir que el incendio s lo ha quemado la parte de la entrada sin extenderse hacia el restaurante lugar que tiene el techo del mismo material
5573077 los taxistas tenemos la obligaci n de llegar a la parada para recoger a las personas que all esperan pero los que regresan a pie intentan que los veh culos se detengan y para ello se echan casi encima de los taxis en medio de la calzada
5573078 se dieron situaciones de indefensi n para el desarrollo de nuestra labor con el orden establecido en las paradas de taxi como las de caffarena parada de ac m laga palacio y la parada de la plaza de la merced siendo abordados los taxis en marcha y no pudiendo decir a los usuarios que fueran a esperar el turno en la parada pues los taxistas eran insultados agredidos e incluso sufrieron da os materiales en los veh culos
5573079 gane o pierda el impeachment en todo caso la naci n ser derrotada sufrir la dignidad del pa s
5573080 el fin de la dictadura y un triunfo de la democracia
5573081 hemos dejado bien claro que estamos al margen del desarrollo pol tico lo observamos pero no interferimos
5573082 ya han causado graves da os no van a causar m s su presencia no tiene ning n sentido exijo que sus tropas ocupantes se vayan de georgia s lo despu s podremos abrir un di logo serio y tomar medidas concretas para que ambos pa ses no nos demos la espalda para siempre
5573083 repliegue de las tropas de paz y las fuerzas de apoyo en la regi n
5573084 existe el concepto de retirada y el de repliegue en la conversaci n que mantuvo el presidente ruso dmitri medv dev con el presidente franc s nicolas sarkozy se habl s lo de repliegue
5573085 espero que os hay is percatado del matiz no se trata de una retirada
5573086 puedo asegurar cu ndo llegar el nuevo a o pero no puedo dar una fecha exacta para el repliegue de nuestras tropas de la zona de conflicto
5573087 s lo puedo decir que no saldremos tan r pido como vinimos
5573088 one night i went to look for him in a bar
5573089 he was surrounded by women i went in and slammed a table a glass broke the bouncer came and i punched caymmis face then i left cussing i thought he was involved with drugs but it wasnt the case he was with the tramps
5573090 i have concluded that to act as a citizen in brazil today is to live a joke
5573091 its the same as playing the lotto dreaming about nonsense trying to get rich when you are 80
5573092 hes working out the modalities and well see what happens
5573093 if you remove a school bus from the road youre adding 40 to 50 cars in the morning and in the afternoon
5573094 are you going to walk a half mile down the street to cross in the appropriate way when you see a clear way right there
5573095 i dont really like it because it takes like 20 minutes to do it
5573096 when its a panic call theyre not thinking it through in that way
5573097 our goal was to keep those cuts as far away from the classroom as possible
5573098 what if fuel should go up by a quarter in a period of a month or two
5573099 we might have to have some emergency response to that
5573100 we are not spending more on fuel this year because were driving less
5573101 delegan la prestaci n a otros profesionales con menos experiencia
5573102 mi llegada al mundo del toreo fue desde muy joven mi padre era aficionado al toreo y me inculc la afici n a los toros desde que yo era peque o as empec a torear en el sur de francia mi pa s natal y despu s me fui a espa a a sevilla con el maestro campuzano para empezar a formarme mejor y comenzar a torear cada vez m s a partir de ah todo cambi y el toreo se ha convertido en mi forma de vida para m lo es todo un modo de entender mi vida todo lo que hago adem s pienso que el torero nace y se hace a s mismo las dos cosas porque est claro que es muy importante el trabajo para mejorar pero lo que es seguro es que si no tienes alg n don si no has nacido con algo es complicado que consigas ser torero
5573103 el miedo es algo natural con lo que hay que convivir y a veces es algo muy dif cil de lidiar lo que es seguro es que s lo se puede superar enfrent ndose a l el valor es otra cosa estoy convencido totalmente seguro de que es lo nico que no le puede faltar a un buen torero
5573104 el triunfo es algo grande es la culminaci n de lo que uno espera hacer siempre y cuando lo logra vivo una plena sensaci n de deber cumplido por mi parte y despu s vienen esos momentos de gloria en el que todo el mundo te eleva al cielo y en los que tienes que mantener los pies en el suelo pero no es dif cil uno es torero tambi n en esos momentos no hay raz n para cambiar cuando tienes claro qui n eres y adonde quieres llegar
5573105 el fracaso es algo muy amargo pero del que he aprendido cuando me ha tocado vivirlo se siente rabia y m s deseos que nunca de darle la vuelta a la situaci n y demostrar de lo que eres capaz el fracaso la decepci n no llegar a donde crees que puedes llegar es lo peor del toreo no obstante nunca he pensado en dejar esto en dejar el toreo en dejarlo todo no creo que ste es mi sitio y debo seguir en l
5573106 hay momentos de verdadera uni n entre el toro y el torero y son algo dif cil de explicar son momentos intensos llenos de arte y de emoci n es la culminaci n de todo son sin duda los mejores momentos aunque tambi n entiendo como lo mejor del toreo la combinaci n de arte y de valor en un enfrentamiento entre hombre y animal
5573107 no creo que el d a que se torea tenga ning n momento peor que otro en realidad momentos malos no hay ninguno es un d a que se vive con tensi n con concentraci n nada m s son los d as se alados y son los que realmente buscamos los toreros por supuesto que hay instantes de soledad sobre todo en el hotel y en esos momentos se piensa en muchas cosas me veo en la plaza esa tarde pienso en lo que puedo hacer despu s llega la corrida el pase llo el toro y todos los siento como momentos intensos llenos de emoci n no hay raz n para sufrir de hecho yo no sufro no hay raz n para ello pero s que otros sufren as que esa primera llamada para tranquilizar es para mi madre
5573108 se debe ser siempre torero y uno lo es o no lo es y eso tiene que ver con todo lo que haces tambi n fuera de la plaza significa vivir en torero apartarse del mundo meditar repasar lo que has hecho ver lo que viene vivir concentrado con el miedo y la incertidumbre como compa eros de viaje adem s el torero tiene un mundo interior muy grande y muy complejo que debe estar fuera de los focos debe haber misterio en los toreros siempre ha sido as as debe ser tambi n est la rivalidad con otros matadores yo s lo miro mi camino no miro el de los dem s pero hay competencia y me encanta
5573109 no s si tengo una faena so ada en la cabeza ha habido muy buenas tardes pero la mejor est a n por llegar yo toreo por amor al toro por pasi n y devoci n a lo que representa la fiesta el toreo es arte y es cultura y forma parte de la identidad de muchos pueblos mi sue o es por supuesto ser el torero m s grande
5573110 los dos pilares del milagro econ mico espa ol se han hundido
5573111 despu s de haber conocido una insolente vitalidad el consumo se hunde
5573112 que muestra que la confianza del consumidor est en su nivel m s bajo desde hace diez a os
5573113 en cuanto al sector de la construcci n que tiraba de la econom a hacia arriba se desploma
5573114 no cuestiono el arte pero si luego mis fieles hablan de guarrer as emplazadas en la v a p blica estoy obligado a intervenir
5573115 regreso a los tiempos oscuros en los que la colita daba miedo
5573116 justo la contraria de la que pretenden los terroristas porque aunque molestaron el domingo la recuperaci n ha sido plena
5573117 el secreto del xito de nuestro equipo es el poder del reggae
5573118 cuando anot el 12 9 en el segundo set limpi mis gafas y cuando me las puse lo primero que vi fue la bandera georgiana creo que fue una se al y me acord de la pel cula rocky por lo que lo primero que hice despu s de que ganamos fue asir la bandera georgiana
5573119 me aferro a las palabras de tolstoi de que la mayor victoria es la victoria sobre uno mismo
5573120 pueden ser indiscriminados incluso en lugares frecuentados por expatriados y viajeros extranjeros
5573121 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
5573122 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
5573123 some of these things become self fulfilling prophecies because market confidence is so fragile
5573124 you dont pass that sort of legislation unless theres some sort of intent to use it
5573125 were certainly poised and ready when market conditions are appropriate
5573126 continues to exceed our regulatory capital requirements we continue to provide stability and liquidity to the housing market and we will continue to play a key role as the market recovers from this cycle
5573127 the storms not a concern it just doesnt look like its going to do a lot of damage
5573128 theres just not enough people to work in the restaurants the pay is so much better
5573129 prices keep going up because they know they can get it
5573130 if youre in the market for a travel trailer good luck theyre flying off the lots
5573131 im having to shop in houston austin and san antonio to find one
5573132 please lord let there be another boom i promise i wont piss it away next time
5573133 this is a much more measured intelligent response than it was 25 years ago
5573134 im just fearful that they dont get caught up on a trap like they did before
5573135 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5573136 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5573137 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer
5573138 creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned
5573139 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5573140 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5573141 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5573142 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5573143 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5573144 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5573145 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5573146 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5573147 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5573148 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5573149 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5573150 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5573151 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5573152 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5573153 the multi year agreement represents a key milestone in our initiative to become the leading supplier of 3g wireless broadband connectivity in the emerging market for mids
5573154 in less than a year our acquisition of part of the former benq siemens mobile r amp d resources and our collaboration with intel have made option an important partner for odms and oems within the mid ecosystem
5573155 bupropion xl compliments our existing bupropion sr offerings and expands the dosage options for our customers and patients this approval also highlights actavis groups focus and expertise in bringing complex controlled release technologies to the marketplace
5573156 de huidige resultaten tonen aan dat nyrstar ondanks uitdagende marktomstandigheden in staat is goede operationele resultaten te behalen in een context van een dalende zinkprijs en een zwakkere eur usd verhouding zijn we ons blijven concentreren op het beheren van factoren waarover we controle hebben door de combinatie van beheerst en gedisciplineerd management zijn we erin geslaagd de productie van zowel zink en lood te verbeteren en de kosten grotendeels gelijk te houden in een inflatoire omgeving
5573157 deze meerjarenovereenkomst betekent een belangrijke mijlpaal in onze plannen om de toonaangevende leverancier te worden van 3g draadloze breedbandconnectiviteit in de groeimarkt voor mids
5573158 in minder dan een jaar hebben onze overname van een gedeelte van het vroegere benq siemens mobile r amp d enerzijds en onze samenwerking met intel anderzijds ertoe geleid dat option een belangrijke partner is geworden voor odms en oems die actief zijn in deze mid markt
5573159 todays results demonstrate nyrstars ability to achieve strong operational performance in spite of challenging market conditions despite a falling zinc price and weakening us exchange rate we have continued to focus on managing factors that are within our control through a combination of prudent and disciplined management we have improved production of both zinc and lead metal and maintained largely flat costs in an inflationary environment
5573160 while we know this settlement will never ease the pain of those enduring enormous heartbreak it does bring years of court proceedings to an end
5573161 how can they decide that all 100 that died and all that was burnt and everything all the survivors that their lives are only worth 10 million
5573162 to have a fire inspector miss the foam on several occasions i just dont see how they would have survived the scrutiny of a trial
5573163 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5573164 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5573165 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5573166 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5573167 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5573168 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5573169 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5573170 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship
5573171 i always knew this was here and i was trying to find something that would be a good age range
5573172 its fun for the kids because they get a chance to act out and they wont get in trouble
5573173 while there has been a little bit of a setback one thing that was never really at issue was the application of the funds from dupont
5573174 weve been waiting for quite some time to make this happen and were really excited that its moving along and well get some houses fixed
5573175 to people who may be doubting thomases go in and lick the wall in here
5573176 les r sultats communiqu s aujourdhui attestent la capacit de nyrstar r aliser de solides r sultats op rationnels malgr des conditions de march difficiles en d pit de la chute du prix du zinc et dun taux de change us d favorable nous avons continu mettre laccent sur les facteurs de gestion sur lesquels nous pouvons agir gr ce une gestion prudente et disciplin e nous avons am lior la production de zinc et de plomb et maintenu des co ts majoritairement stables dans un contexte inflationniste

5573181 definitivamente eu n o vou morrer de c ncer de mama
5573182 see what happens i told you not to climb up there
5573183 you just sit there until i say you can get up
5573184 ari has to sit in a time out because he is a bad boy
5573185 lilly is my niece she was 23 months old when this was done in august 2007 in her parents small one bedroom apartment she now knows over 80 countries yes we know that tasmania is not a country everyone its still a fun place to know she knows better geography than a 5th grader she has been doing this for about 8 months she is one funny niece
5573186 thats obviously an important long term funding stream but in terms of projects that are currently in the pipeline for the fiscal year that has just begun obviously there is funding to support that
5573187 the transportation infrastructure the roads bridges and mass transit are all in broad decline literally bridges are crumbling and roads are not maintained
5573188 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
5573189 advances in high fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
5573190 were still paying a full dollar a gallon more than we were last year
5573191 these high prices over 3 a gallon are here to stay for awhile its hard to see prices under the circumstances going much below 3 a gallon this year
5573192 sadly the whale is back moving around the yachts in the basin and it is continuing to try and suckle them
5573193 we wont try and move it again as we would be adding to its stress levels
5573194 it would normally still be feeding from its mother so without nourishment it only has another 5 to 7 days
5573195 he certainly has given me no reason to take him out right now nolan said
5573196 i feel good about the rotation right now and i dont want to mix it up on the short week nolan said
5573197 just keep playing well hes been doing a good job all three guys including shaun hill have been doing well some are getting more reps than others but ive been pleased with all three of them i do feel confident weve got three guys who can win games
5573198 they talked about going into the third preseason game and battling it out until then i just hope i get the opportunity to start
5573199 i think everyone has something to prove in this league osullivan said
5573200 tonight i had another opportunity to go out and do it
5573201 freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one
5573202 in all things of nature there is something of the marvelous
5573203 were playing pickup basketball and theres a rifle rack behind the bench
5573204 one guy lost three limbs his legs and an arm all he had was his right arm to shake our hand
5573205 it was unbelievable to see the bravery of these young people
5573206 you enter the rear of the plane into the belly and there are benches
5573207 when we go to the airport here they hand you a boarding pass
5573208 at the airport in kuwait they handed us body armor and a helmet
5573209 my team was made up of sergeant majors they are veterans so they were a little older in their 40s
5573210 i had one bronx guy on my team my two home boroughs
5573211 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5573212 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5573213 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5573214 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5573215 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5573216 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5573217 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5573218 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5573219 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5573220 people are playing in their head considering what happened the last time
5573221 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5573222 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5573223 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5573224 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5573225 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe
5573226 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5573227 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5573228 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5573229 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis
5573230 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5573231 a v is the story of duane a successful salesman who longs to be a writer but never quite finds the time after an eye opening experience duane abandons his current career path and takes a less demanding position as a hotel a v technician his new job gives him time for creative dawdling but his colorful co workers cause him to question is this the type of place to nurture ones dreams or ones hangover
5573232 my thing is if youre dumb enough to live in frisco you deserve what you get
5573233 demand is doubling every year and still we are only seeing those who are at the extreme end because we dont have the resources to see the others
5573234 obviously wed rather prevent obesity than treat it so we never have to see these people in a hospital but this is a start
5573235 there is a major lack of understanding in the community about obesity and its effects
5573236 it hasnt been taken seriously as a medical issue and very limited resources have been put into it there have been a lot of plans at a government level but little action this new position will help us tackle it but i still believe we are only hitting the tip of the iceberg
5573237 it is amazing that it has got to this stage
5573238 i wish we could get funding to do the same thing because we are seeing a real increase in the number of overweight children and obesity has a huge impact on cancer diabetes and heart disease
5573239 all the improvements that have been made in combating these diseases is being wiped out by obesity
5573240 issues of social acceptance athletic competence and physical appearance are well known to obese children and affect their sense of social and psychological wellbeing
5573241 obese children with decreasing self esteem are more likely to smoke and drink alcohol compared with those whose self esteem increases or remains the same
5573242 a lot of people drive into water of unknown depths
5573243 even a small deviation in the forecast track would cause a large difference in when and where it makes landfall along that coast
5573244 we want every every floridian and guest to be a survivor
5573245 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5573246 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5573247 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5573248 one need not overly focus on the idiosyncracies of making a perfect final sports betting art piece but instead on making foundation work solid and easy to discern
5573249 its true i have something called alopecia areata i dont have hair anywhere on my body
5573250 i first noticed a spot the size of a quarter on the back of my head when i was going to a photo shoot
5573251 i put some brown eyeshadow on it and went off it was really scary
5573252 he said oh its alopecia areata its caused by stress by the way we now know stress is not the cause of alopecia but he gave me a prescription for valium i was sleeping all day long
5573253 my hairline just kept receding all the way around in the back around my ears it was really bad
5573254 i could handle the rest of it but that wasnt fun
5573255 hair defines women our femininity our sexuality you cant look at a womans magazine without seeing ads for shampoo and conditioner and volumizer so when you start losing your hair its pretty hard
5573256 i thought how dumb is my immune system whats going on here
5573257 and they were going to make a grab for my hair
5573258 maybe three times we were standing at the front door of my house and he was going to caress my neck
5573259 i told him i have something to tell you i have alopecia areata an autoimmune disorder and i dont have hair anywhere
5573260 he looked at me with giant eyes and he couldnt talk he was going uh uh uh and backing away and he fell down the stairs he mumbled something about having to go
5573261 at the time of your diagnosis its certainly not very funny but as you navigate the waters of this condition humor really helps
5573262 it could be a lot worse you could have something that could kill you
5573263 a woman was wearing her wig and mowing the lawn

5573268 the united states will consider providing 1 billion in emergency aid to georgia a top u s lawmaker said monday on his return from a visit to the conflict torn nation
5573269 when congress reconvenes i intend to work with the administration to seek congressional approval for 1 billion in emergency assistance for georgia
5573270 this money will help the people of georgia recover from the damage that has been inflicted on their economy and send a clear message that the united states will not abandon this young democracy

5573278 we planned to find a way to ensure a stable electricity supply at a reasonable price

5573280 quand je me l ve le matin je dis toujours ma femme que jai encore envie de tirer
5573281 there was nothing that could be called a true sticking point
5573282 its just a matter of knocking down each element of a very complex agreement
5573283 were all obviously pretty excited when there is a 5 billion project on our doorstep
5573284 as far as the tradeoffs we just dont know yet
5573285 evidently we didnt do enough work in the last 10 days
5573286 like i told them its my fault for trying to save them a little bit and not beat them up on the practice field so we came down here and got beat up in the game
5573287 as soon as we got back to practice amani showed me
5573288 hes the best in the business at that he knows just how to stay in even if he has to fall doing it

5573295 this project will not only bring the pilbaras electricity system into the 21st century but the communities that rely on that system will flourish as a result
5573296 we have a long term vision for the pilbara and this is the cornerstone to fulfilling those plans
5573297 the prospect of an operational electricity market has already resulted in two independent private sector proposals being put to the government for the provision of up to 2 000mw of electricity for 2013

5573300 i mean everybody knows that ashraf was appointed by president pervez musharraf and he ashraf had to go once the president decided to resign
5573301 the trouble is in picking him i have not seen any bowler like this he is an unusual bowler the only option right now is to play more and more of him thats the only way of getting better
5573302 even if you pick him by the time you realise what ball it is it gets really late to play a big shot you will see batsmen who can play him but in one day cricket it is not only about playing him you have to rotate the strike because you dont want a bowler to end up with ten overs for 20 runs
5573303 we will need to find a way by which we can rotate the strike if not play big shots you cant score 180 or 200 and look to defend that you have to get a decent score for which we will have to score off each and every bowler
5573304 murali and mendis are different bowlers murali can turn the ball on any wicket he loves sri lankan wickets
5573305 even when he bowls fast he gets some purchase out of the wicket no other spinner would have got so much turn
5573306 its important to get a good start in the last two games we lost quick wickets when you are playing mendis you have to save wickets and get the runs as well
5573307 it gets a bit tough with time batsmen will get used to it even murali sometime back was difficult mendis is a bit more unusual than muralitharan
5573308 to start with we misread the wicket a bit we did not think it would seam or swing that much
5573309 there was a fair bit in the wicket to start off the sri lankan bowlers bowled really well they got the first two batsmen out it was not like the batsmen played bad shots and got out credit goes to their fast bowlers
5573310 whatever fits the team best we will decide on that
5573311 it takes a while before people pick up on it
5573312 theyve got to stay focused on the customers as hard as it is with all the distractions
5573313 mediocre and undistinguished for a mature and crucial e business industry
5573314 this culture of people holding foreign passports leaving the country as soon as they are forced to leave their powerful positions must stop they must be held accountable for their deeds shaukat aziz the former prime minister had gone abroad and no one could do anything against him
5573315 i fear ashraf will also leave for the united states soon so his name should be put on the ecl until the probe into cricket affairs is completed
5573316 persepsi masyarakat pada 2009 2010 suku bunga kembali rendah itu terlihat dari tingginya harga surat utang negara sun dengan demikian ori jadi pilihan baik dibandingkan investasi dengan tingkat bunga rendah
5573317 tetapi kalau boleh beli ori tahan sampai jatuh tempo karena akan menguntungkan juga khususnya untung dari modal
5573318 ada baiknya sebagian dana dimanfaatkan ke ori tapi yang sudah beli di saham jangan cut loss manfaatkan duit nganggur belikan ori saja bisa memberikan pendapatan pasti
5573319 kita sudah usaha jualan ori di luar jawa seperti makkasar bali medan dan pekanbaru tetapi tidak optimal uang masih ngumpulnya di jabodetabek khususnya jakarta
5573320 jadi kalau investor mau beli sekaranglah waktunya jangan sampai kehabisan

5573322 that didnt stop the obama campaign from issuing a response to the absence
5573323 will those little jerks at the obama campaign never be satisfied
5573324 others took it as an assertion of his involvement with the campaign going so far as to insinuate he was hosting the event

5573340 why dont they go drill somewhere else someday all of mineral ridge is going to fall into the mines this is not a problem only on edwards street
5573341 they went down into the mines and found it was only 10 feet below the house
5573342 indiana pennsylvania these states had subsidence insurance ohio did not
5573343 go look where the new houses are being built its an edwards street problem but the mine doesnt just stay here
5573344 we had two young boys and they were devastated the first thing they did was move far away no way were they going to live here
5573345 i thought that the amish lived not with other people didnt use electricity
5573346 i thought they were closed to other people that they didnt want anyone to visit but i realize now they are really just like other people and i didnt expect them to be so friendly
5573347 it is an interesting experience for us because so much of the bible talks about cities and places in iraq
5573348 we dont use electricity because of everything that comes with it
5573349 we dont want our children to sit in front of the tv and be exposed to all of those temptations
5573350 each instance is weighed carefully and voted on by the church

5573353 josh was the kinda guy who was always thinking about everyone else and what he could do for them
5573354 his packet modeled the characteristics we saw in josh as well as he met all the academic qualifications
5573355 wanted to create a scholarship based on civility and kindness towards others regardless of their station in life
5573356 the main purpose of the scholarship was that we wanted joshs memory to live on and we wanted to give back and we know thats what josh would have wanted to give back to his community
5573357 then i talked to my neighbor because i had done stuff for her while her husband was in iraq
5573358 just kinda listened to everybody and picked out some good examples of what type of person i thought i was
5573359 josh was a reserved person i mean he wasnt one of those individuals who was loud but he had that aura about him that was helpful and supportive and brad carried those same characteristics high integrity the things that you look for honesty the stewardship too the school and community
5573360 i think thats really the type of person id like to be its just a real honor that people think of me that way
5573361 ive known her for a long time and she just told me that when she was designing the scholarship that i was one of the first people she thought of
5573362 that really meant a lot to me i just thought it was cool that she thought of me when she was doing that
5573363 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5573364 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5573365 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5573366 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5573367 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5573368 to go through what i went through and be back on top again im just so blessed right now
5573369 they had guys in 68 that didnt make the team that could whip this team im not taking anything away from these young athletes but i dont think they have anywhere near the depth we had
5573370 they dont appreciate somebody too fancy or too phony and sen mccain has got an authenticity about him
5573371 say what you will about barack obama people gravitate when you have something positive to say people want to follow hopeful optimistic decent leaders they dont want to follow some negative scornful person
5573372 i was just trying to make the general point that people prefer positive leadership optimistic leadership like ronald reagan

5573384 were very encouraged with how weve been able to drive generic utilization for our members and consumers because we know that the use of generic medications is the most effective way to keep prescription drug spending manageable
5573385 a lack of blockbuster drugs in the pharmaceutical development pipeline along with increasing acceptance of generic drugs by consumers suggests that the low increase we saw during 2007 will be sustained for some time to come
5573386 we are very pleased to have entered into the merger agreement with csl

5573396 this is definitely the most high profile case of contractor abuse in iraq but its certainly not the only one
5573397 it is with deep regret that i learn that david makovsky of the washington institute for near east policy implied that i would accept compensation for the impoverishing and destructive effects of israels wall as built around the west bank town of qalqilya the town of which i am mayor as i made clear to mr makovsky during his visit that while i would welcome any relief offered to the suffering residents of qalqilya such relief would not be necessary if israel builds its wall on the border the green line between what became israel in 1948 and occupied palestinian territory i made it very clear to mr makovsky with the express intent that mr makovsky not misconstrue my statements for his own purposes that under no conditions would i or the residents of qalqilya accept or otherwise acquiesce to the construction of the wall in exchange for compensation our property and our human rights are not for sale

5573406 there is no doubt that we need a radical approach like this because although intellectually most of us know what needs to be done old patterns of living continue to dominate including in muslim communities and green house gas emissions continue to rise as well as fasting during ramadan through fast for the planet we can get our bodies and hearts involved in a process that will help break us out of outdated and ecologically destructive patterns this is a way to a better world that can only be more consistent with the essential principles of islam

5573443 but i had a lot of fun with it i wouldnt let the props guys take it back from me in the end
5573444 ive wanted to act as soon as i got on a movie set
5573445 but its a big shift in your mind when go from being the accessory to the one in front of the camera id kind of sit in the trailer and hang out
5573446 i was a big dork i was kind of a computer nerd braces and glasses and i had this big curly fro i wasnt too active getting into the social crowd so i definitely understand not entirely fitting in everyone has their own version of feeling out of place

5573448 we have known each other a long time because we toured together years ago and we like each others bands
5573449 we used to watch each other every night when you get on tour you dont always watch the other bands we knew that about each other when youre on tour all summer its nice to be able to hear some music you like
5573450 im just happy to return with these guys because there are so few bands at this point that are touring bands that are for real
5573451 theres a lot of smoke and mirrors these days so its nice we both go out there and hit the road and do it the old fashioned way
5573452 im not a chart follower necessarily but im definitely interested in whats going on because obviously our business is in such shambles that its amazing that we do sell records
5573453 i cant believe that people go to a store in this day and age and purchase albums
5573454 even if you do sell records at this point its still no guarantee that you can go on tour to me thats the most valuable asset any band can have is being able to go on the road and play now matter what the hell is going on with the record business
5573455 i dont think we do sell very many records ourselves
5573456 at the same time i think this is about to be a golden age for selling music i really truly believe that theres just a machine out there that allows you to connect with everyone in the entire world for free theres no way thats not a good marketing tool the record company looks at it solely as a cash register that someones got their hand in but its not its a billboard too
5573457 wow with the humidity water and heat why arent there mosquitoes i havent been bit by one yet
5573458 well yes i am actually ive been waiting almost 20 years to see the fall in manchester

5573474 compulsive hoarding is defined in part by clutter that so overtakes living dining and sleeping spaces that it harms the persons quality of life a compulsive hoarder finds it impossible even painful to part with possessions its not clear how many people suffer from compulsive hoarding but estimates start at about 1 5 million americans dr tolin recently studied compulsive hoarders using brain scan technology while in the scanner hoarders looked at various possessions and made decisions about whether to keep them or throw them away the items were shredded in front of them so they knew the decision was irreversible when a hoarder was making decisions about throwing away items the researchers saw increased activity in the orbitofrontal cortex a part of the brain involved in decision making and planning

5573482 its in our neighborhood in a lot of towns thats not the case here theyre amid our homes
5573483 there are some people that are pretty doggone tired of that and i think they have a reason to be

5573490 i think it would be a benefit for the public to know when the committee is meeting and to be able to see the information as the committee meets that ultimately will be presented in a report
5573491 is a content neutral regulation it serves substantial governmental interests it is narrowly tailored and it leaves open reasonable alternative channels of communication
5573492 as a matter of law the citys regulation of electronic signs is content neutral and narrowly tailored to serve significant governmental interests and allows for reasonable alternative channels of communication
5573493 the record did not significantly change on summary judgment except perhaps to make concords case stronger
5573494 wanted to see where i was at and not slow down too much
5573495 i was pretty mad but had to get over it

5573498 se est n teniendo en cuenta a la hora de comprobar las operaciones la informaci n que reflejan las empresas en sus p ginas web

5573509 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5573510 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5573511 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5573512 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5573513 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern
5573514 the country is facing the global crisis far more successfully than some had expected
5573515 in any case 7 5 percent is a very favorable level of growth and will remain among the highest in the region
5573516 it is typical of the economic cycle and it appears that the country is facing the global crisis far more successfully than some had expected
5573517 despite the decline in oil prices we continue to believe that inflation will reach double digits the main reason for the escalation of prices is that food prices have not stopped their ascent
5573518 obama has had to deal with that and questions about his
5573519 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5573520 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5573521 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5573522 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5573523 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5573524 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5573525 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5573526 its a huge challenge and they cannot face it individually its very important for them to work together and i think they know that
5573527 america wants some immediate decisions on fighting terrorism and i dont think they will be able to concentrate on that
5573528 on the other hand are the people of this country the business community and there too i dont see any new initiatives
5573529 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5573530 whatever one might say it may be difficult for the politicians to give him the indemnity
5573531 there were certain elements who were politicking with the economy and terrorism
5573532 the opposition did not show any respect to their opponents is this the image of the party that wants to rule the country

5573536 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
5573537 no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law

5573539 at my old company a us multinational anyone involved with a particular product was encouraged to be a product evangelist and software users these days so we hear want to be platform atheists so that their computers will run programs from any manufacturer
5573540 i am just on the verge of finishing a script i am working on about the functioning and psychology of media so far you have seen the media exposing things and now i want to expose the media in all its naked glory
5573541 the media has transformed from a truth telling machinery to a power mongering and money making enterprise
5573542 watching with glee someone else fall down and to be ripped to shreds
5573543 they tend to fall in love more with the way they rip the film apart much more than they hate the film
5573544 when they journalists get a certain whiff of an interesting story on someone their greatest fear would be that it will be denied by the person
5573545 it is primarily because most of the mumbai media hobnobs and rubs shoulders with the film people
5573546 the film people out of their fear and greed and in order to use the media people open their doors to them and almost become informants to the media about the rest of their colleagues in the industry
5573547 media loses its primary objective and tends to get embroiled in the camp culture of the industry
5573548 i dont believe that the media is so dumb it was unintentional and when i wrote the 11 things it was all in good humour i even made fun of myself in the blog why is it being taken further
5573549 its not a role that i carry home with happiness in deepti navals film do paise ki dhoop chaar aane ki baarish im cast as a girl who not only has to look plain she has to look ugly sometimes plainly repulsive its not easy playing someone like that it affects me badly so this was a sober birthday for me
5573550 my look and the wretchedness of my character will remind people of charlize theron in monster i think she won an oscar for that
5573551 normally ive a big party every year where i invite all my friends or i go off to one my favourite countries spain or france this year i was in no mood to travel or celebrate
5573552 my father who was seriously ill is recuperating at home and though hes well on the way to recovery i didnt feel like a noisy party this time i think im over all those party times
5573553 with just me my brother siddharth my bhabhi and my parents and a few very close friends including deepti of course i cant ask for anything more actually i can
5573554 my boyfriend chris could be with me but hes in the us working and unable to join me for my birthday never mind
5573555 ive everything i can possibly want but yes at the end of this year im getting myself a house in paris im just waiting for real estate prices to fall more its been rapidly falling all over the world and that includes france but surprisingly real estate prices are still high in paris itself i think ill wait six more months
5573556 this is for the first time i have received an award which is not completely related to films
5573557 i just read your blog even thou we cannot be close frens anymore i do not see y we shld end up being enemies when u come bk to bw i will still welcome u with a smile take care
5573558 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5573559 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5573560 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5573561 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5573562 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5573563 sen jones has been a passionate advocate who has fought for working families and the underprivileged
5573564 used his position as senate president to give those without a voice better health care better funded schools and increases in the minimum wage
5573565 emil jones is a man with a big heart and a man of action
5573566 i can work with attila the hun if i have to
5573567 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5573568 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5573569 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5573570 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5573571 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5573572 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5573573 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5573574 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5573575 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5573576 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5573577 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5573578 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5573579 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5573580 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5573581 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5573582 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5573583 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5573584 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5573585 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5573586 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5573587 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5573588 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5573589 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5573590 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5573591 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5573592 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5573593 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5573594 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5573595 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5573596 this is a planning took where all things are going
5573597 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5573598 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5573599 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5573600 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5573601 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5573602 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5573603 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5573604 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5573605 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5573606 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5573607 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5573608 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5573609 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5573610 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5573611 wir gehen von j hrlich bis zu 10 mrd eur aus
5573612 zuk nftige pr sident und die pakistanische regierung zusammen an der entwicklung und festigung der demokratie in pakistan arbeiten k nnen

5573614 indeed it may create tensions just as complex as when the white black divide was the countrys outstanding problem
5573615 everyone wants a piece of the pie and no one is focusing on making a better pie
5573616 black people viewed the attack on crew as an offense against a qualified black man
5573617 it was a message that we have no place here it greatly increased tensions
5573618 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5573619 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5573620 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5573621 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5573622 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5573623 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5573624 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5573625 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5573626 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5573627 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5573628 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5573629 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5573630 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5573631 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5573632 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5573633 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5573634 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5573635 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5573636 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5573637 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5573638 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5573639 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5573640 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5573641 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5573642 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5573643 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5573644 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5573645 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5573646 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5573647 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5573648 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5573649 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5573650 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5573651 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5573652 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5573653 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5573654 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5573655 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5573656 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5573657 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5573658 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5573659 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5573660 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5573661 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5573662 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5573663 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5573664 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5573665 der gro und au enhandel in sorge um die konjunktur die gro e koalition mu jetzt handeln
5573666 die fraktion die linke hat eindeutig eine gemeinsame position ich gehe davon aus dass wir diese auch gemeinsam bis 2013 tragen werden
5573667 wir sagen was wir machen und wir machen was wir sagen

5573680 but more of the fact that for once a local movie of this scale was directed and written by a rookie director who managed to inject so much patriotism that i was all too proud for words
5573681 were going to have a pretty unique system in the state of rhode island when all is said and done
5573682 were going to be able to watch our port from the atlantic all the way up our harbor
5573683 it was very unique and we were blazing a trail
5573684 youll have almost 100 percent coverage of the entire bay
5573685 certainly some aspects of the technology are troubling if people are being spied on if these cameras have that ability
5573686 in many respects its very similar to the issues that arise with surveillance cameras on land the issues are pretty much the same how much detail do the cameras provide can you zoom in with much detail are there policies in place on how you can get access to the information how long the information is kept for
5573687 some people may have an issue with the big brother thing but its certainly not about that
5573688 they all went in the drink and the cameras were right there watching it the watch standard at dem saw it all because the cameras saw it and she immediately contacted the coast guard
5573689 these hotels are justifiably outraged by this order which puts them in the awkward position of having to craft pop up messages explaining to their customers that their web history communications searches and key strokes are being spied on by the chinese government
5573690 they have no reasonable expectation of privacy in public or private locations
5573691 all hotel rooms and offices are considered to be subject to on site or remote technical monitoring at all times
5573692 if you were a human rights advocate if youre a journalist youre in room 1251 of a hotel anything that you use sending out over the internet is monitored in real time by the chinese public security bureau
5573693 allow ed for massive untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either congress or the courts it contain ed virtually no protections for the u s end of the phone call or email leaving decisions about the collection mining and use of americans private communications up to this administration
5573694 only by all governments working in partnership with indigenous peoples can we close the gap
5573695 todays formal commitment from such a wide variety of groups is a very significant occasion for all victorians
5573696 but there is still more to be done to close the 17 year gap between the life expectancy of an aboriginal person and a non aboriginal person
5573697 the momentum generated from a partnership between state governments the federal government and the aboriginal people we can be the generation that finally closed the gap
5573698 while all communities are networks groups and teams not all networks groups and teams are communities in the same manner that while all teams are groups and networks not all networks and groups are teams and while all groups are networks not all networks are groups

5573700 we have already made many improvements to mobileme but we still have many more to make to recognize our users patience we are giving every mobileme subscriber as of today a free 60 day extension this is in addition to the one month extension most subscribers have already received we are working very hard to make mobileme a great service we can all be proud of we know that mobilemes launch has not been our finest hour and we truly appreciate your patience as we turn this around
5573701 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5573702 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5573703 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5573704 their new found cockiness has got some substance to it
5573705 i knew my foot would fail me i felt painful when i was just jogging
5573706 so many people have been worried and caring about me i feel sorry i could do nothing but pull out of the race
5573707 i didnt know why things turned out this way i wanted to hang on but i couldnt it was unbearable if i had finished the race i would have risked my tendon i could not describe my feeling at that moment
5573708 therell be opportunities next year and afterwards therell still be opportunities after all im still in peak condition i need to be a bit optimistic and cant grumble and blame others
5573709 very concerned about liu xiangs injury and hopes he will receive swift treatment and soon heal
5573710 everyone will understand why liu xiang had to abandon competition due to injury and we hope he will cast aside mental burdens and settle his mind on overcoming injury
5573711 perhaps a nation of 1 3 billion should not place the burdens of its aspirations on a boys shoulders
5573712 its just experience shes been in the olympics before shes been in world championships shes jumped a decade longer than me so its just a matter of time

5573723 hey clown are you laughin at me i make you laugh im here to fuckin amuse you
5573724 a lot of times i wished i was dead back in my pow days
5573725 hey there little flirt did i ever tell you about the cross in the dirt
5573726 you see this watch i kept this watch up my ass for five long years
5573727 the insinuation from joe and sandy that john mccain a future prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5573728 porque de tal manera amo dios al mundo que ha dado a su hijo unigenito para que todo aquel que en el crea no se pierda mas tenga vida eterna
5573729 his setup must not be so great if you cant even tell the difference
5573730 if she didnt have a refrigerator intlxpatr only she calls me by my real name what did she do about laundry and diapers when you came along
5573731 i remember our next door neighbors had a barrel shaped washing machine with a hand cranked wringer
5573732 but i think by that point my mom had a more modern washing machine i dont know what she was using when i was born
5573733 porque de tal manera amo dios al mundo que ha dado a su hijo unigenito para que todo aquel que en el crea no se pierda mas tenga vida eterna

5573735 we havent had any sleep we deployed near the highway and the perimeter of the town so they could not enter again
5573736 this was back when supporting americas efforts in iraq entailed serious political risk
5573737 it was a clarifying moment it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5573738 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5573739 our troops have performed magnificently and violence is genuinely down
5573740 but listen if you drive a bus into a ditch and then after five years and a trillion dollars and 4 000 lives lost you are getting the bus halfway out of the ditch it doesnt mean you made a good decision driving the bus off the road in the first place
5573741 i know democrats have not been that successful in presidential elections over the last few cycles
5573742 and so everywhere i go people tell me oh im getting nervous republicans are so mean theyre going to swift boat you theyre going to be doing things to you what are we going to do
5573743 and i have to just remind people that it is true that just as john mccain has embraced george bushs policies hes embraced his politics the same guys who brought you george bush are now trying to package john mccain they cant win an argument on ideas so theyre going to do is try to attack me
5573744 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5573745 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5573746 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps and those are the lessons learned it was over the last few years that we were able to incorporate all of the lessons learned that we have throughout this investigation
5573747 unfortunately a lot of them are not going to be able to be answered in the immediate future
5573748 i dont think no 1 were ever going to put the suspicions to bed
5573749 his only response was that he wanted to hang out there which was not a very compelling reason
5573750 oops my sd card is full but ive got to get that shot
5573751 there wasnt anything he couldnt hit and he had such short arms you couldnt jam him with a pitch
5573752 i hope he makes it hes on my hall of fame ballot
5573753 when i get to that point of my career then ill think about that
5573754 its been a long year but im happy for the opportunity to go to the playoffs hopefully and win
5573755 its a chance to have the last part of my dream fulfilled
5573756 you look at the numbers and our bullpen has collectively struggled
5573757 but i dont associate those numbers with morrow not being here going back to spring training morrow didnt make the club and j j putz was hurt right as the season started and for most of april the bullpen struggled then late in april it was able to turn things around and the pen was solid for a long time now were just in one of those stretches again like april where no one is pitching well
5573758 in my mind theres no doubt if were in situation like those in june or july when the bullpen was hot we win those games
5573759 really roy corcoran has been the only pitcher who hasnt had trouble pitching out of the bullpen lately
5573760 i was hitting good coming up to the break too for whatever reason i started to feel real good at the plate after the all star game
5573761 the only numbers that mean anything to me are rbis and runs scored
5573762 and even now i dont know what my numbers are 84 rbis and 63 runs its only after the season that ill look at the numbers
5573763 all those doubles means im staying in the gaps with my swing
5573764 thats the one thing ive always tried to do to drive in the ball in the gaps that the best way to drive in runs
5573765 were hoping that saturday hell be throwing to a catcher in the bullpen
5573766 hes not a guy you have to be prepared to sit against left handers
5573767 the last few years i hit left handers better than right handers
5573768 of course those are triple a left handers there are some up here that arent like that i found that out firsthand against francisco liriano
5573769 but after i gave up the go ahead homer to orlando cabrera it was a loss of concentration
5573770 its surprising because they should normally be expecting to see the fastball because they should have been expecting the fastball its amazing they stayed on the changeup as well as they did
5573771 we probably should have gone back to the fastball sooner than we did
5573772 one hit in front of the plate and one hit me in the neck
5573773 hadits riwayat muslim 233 dari abu hurairah radhiyallahu anhu juga bahwasanya rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pernah naik mimbar kemudian berkata amin amin amin
5573774 ya rasulullah engkau naik mimbar kemudian mengucapkan amin amin amin
5573775 barangsiapa yang mendapati bulan ramadhan tapi tidak diampuni dosanya maka akan masuk neraka dan akan allah jauhkan dia katakan
5573776 ya rasulullah apa pendapatmu jika aku bersaksi bahwa tidak ada sesembahan yang hak kecuali allah engkau adalah rasulullah aku shalat lima waktu aku tunaikan zakat aku lakukan puasa ramadhan dan shalat tarawih di malam harinya termasuk orang yang manakah aku
5573777 penuh iman dan ihtisab yakni membenarkan wajibnya puasa mengharap pahalanya hatinya senang dalam mengamalkan tidak membencinya tidak merasa berat dalam mengamalkannya

5573786 we are talking about the worlds most financially successful sports league
5573787 it isnt protectionism when you have a billion dollar player trampling on a 100 million players marketplace so what campbell is quite correctly pointing out is lets at least have the debate lets not be naive that a small well run canadian institution is going to survive up against a multi billion dollar aggressive u s competitor unless there are canadian content rules or canadian culture rules that say we value our country
5573788 the day that the nfl comes here im sure the people who aspire to bring a team here would agree thats the day that hbo should be able to come here and its the day that espn should be able to come here
5573789 and its the day the crtc should relax its canadian content regulations and its the day the canadian magazine industry shouldnt be subsidized by the canadian government to the tune of 60 million a year of which 75 are owned by large corporations
5573790 there is something about stephen harper i just dont like
5573791 films promoting homosexuality graphic sex or violence should not receive tax dollars

5573793 you know what to be honest i come to the ballpark i dont ask about joe crede
5573794 im not going to say hes out of my mind but hes out of my picture thats the way im going about my job ive got 25 problems i dont need 26
5573795 if he made a decision to go or fight against it we didnt advise him either way
5573796 we really did keep our fingers out of this one
5573797 president musharraf has been a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5573798 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5573799 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation
5573800 there is a great deal of frustration on the part of the u s government with pakistans inability to follow through on what the u s sees as its clear commitments
5573801 it remains very much to be seen whether this new democratically elected leadership will really be able to follow through in a sustained and coherent way
5573802 it could actually be setting the torch to the kindling inside the country
5573803 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty
5573804 it puts a lot more responsibility squarely on the government there is no more excuse any more they have to stand up and do things they cant blame musharraf
5573805 i really dont think he has been a factor for six months
5573806 he hasnt been able to do that while he was in the presidency and he wont be as well positioned out of the presidency to interfere
5573807 strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5573808 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5573809 since the september 16 2007 incident we have said that based on statements of company personnel who were directly involved we believe those involved acted appropriately
5573810 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual
5573811 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5573812 we can have equality in access to education and health but not in equality of income

5573817 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5573818 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5573819 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5573820 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there
5573821 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5573822 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5573823 i wish it was sort of true being on quidditch with him would be kind of cool
5573824 we say join the club it makes us feel old too
5573825 obviously if you use the water upstream it wont be there for the person to use it downstream
5573826 my first thought was this is ridiculous that we cant collect our own rain water
5573827 thats the idea of the water rights system is to protect the people who put water to use and who want to put water to use they ought to have some certainty about what to expect from everyone else
5573828 his investment is secure because he has the right to use it
5573829 how many times have you been in the shower scrubbing away singing tooooooo much to doooooo
5573830 they put the palace and the artifacts at extreme risk they entered during the evening none of the lights were on we could have a lot more serious damage to these irreplaceable artifacts
5573831 not really upsetting more sad more disappointed that someone especially of being of kanaka should actually desecrate the palace
5573832 we built a relationship over the last four months with the dlnr enforcement around here and you know they only really doing their jobs
5573833 im just glad that im actually right here taking pictures on the outside
5573834 being an mexican american i see where the people who are traditional here would want something that was theirs back
5573835 i can see their reasoning but i cannot see the way they went about it
5573836 consumers have musical choice what musical choice in or society we choose only from what we are given to choose from and that choice is determined by 5 major media corporations who control the exposure outlets that consumers depend on for their entertainment
5573837 record companies like to make money and that is their only goal they do not care about the content that they sell they care about maximizing their profits it is because of this that i hate record companies with the same passion that i hate venture capitalists the record companies do not try to foster a creative environment which rewards musicians who serve their respective niche but create an environment which attempts to market a small amount of music to the largest audience possible it is more profitable for the record company to sell a few decent records in bulk than to have a vast array of cult hits that sell decently
5573838 this is all about greed something the record entertainment industry has honed to a science dusty lps the artists they dont care but if theres a nickel on the floor look out theyll cut your throat for it because they need that nickel artists get paid a small sum then the capital boys live off them like kings until the next big thing then its over so its not about the music you see its about their nickel thats why you cant have any sharing of long gone music because there might be a nickel there and they want it they wouldnt give to a charity if it wasnt showing them handing over a cheque or had a building named after them so why would they be charitable on long lost material strangely they even tried to stop resale of used cds because there was that darned nickel they wouldnt get may all the industry suits have children who hate them
5573839 who says words belong to us how did we get to own them copyright is just another bullshit western ego trip and a capitalistic greed scheme nobody can own the fucking words and its a good thing too
5573840 for example this project was scheduled to cost taxpayers something like 270 thousand dollars we did it with 125 thousand and on time
5573841 referentia has been with us been with us for many years now doing defense work punaluu builders are very successful people and so were lucky to have these people on the partnership roll
5573842 ah the motivation is really simple its community outreach its being able to help the students give them an opportunity to understand that science and technology jobs are available in the islands and this is how you get started
5573843 they need to be exposed to the high tech and the state of the art because these are the future of hawaii and theyll be going out and they need to be exposed to whats out there in the business community
5573844 thats orrect if you look in the paper recently youll see that the number of jobs are growing in the small tech community and its growing at a higher rate than the rate of growth on the mainland so its a really good thing for hawaii
5573845 mom dad ive made a decision i want you to know something
5573846 i have decided that i want to just be an average guy
5573847 is that ok with you i just want to go to an average college i just want to be an average person

5573882 in other words the requirements that we will put in place will ensure that if there is an australian or someone based in australia who is ready willing and able to work in the horticulture industry then theyll get the jobs first
5573883 were going to review that pilot program halfway through to see whether its a success to whether the requirements weve put in place are working effectively
5573884 and if it is successful to see whether it might be sensible to expand the capacity to other areas of australia or indeed to other countries in the pacific
5573885 yet for some inexplicable reason the labor party says the horticultural industry can have workers but the tourism industry cant

5573953 somalia is at war and nobody cares mogadishu sounds crazy
5573954 its difficult for us to go where our clan doesnt live we cant
5573955 theres no problem that would force us to go that far we havent seen that kind of a drought yet
5573956 we can travel inside ethiopia where our clan lives and we can wait for allah to bring rain
5573957 you have made this man deny that there is even a drought
5573958 it is something from the war maybe her parents were murdered in front of her
5573959 i asked her if she knew she was in ethiopia but she doesnt know what ethiopia is she does not know her own country even she only knows her clan
5573960 i knew i had a relative who owned a guest house in the town so i went there
5573961 i woke him and i said to him i am your relative i come from such and such clan and my uncle is so and so
5573962 i told him my security is threatened and i need a place to sleep
5573963 people cant believe it because isaaq is really my last name and its also the main clan of somaliland and jibril abokor is a subclan of isaaq so his name is after my subclan and my clan
5573964 they used to shoot each other and it was very dangerous to travel from place to place there were more than 30 checkpoints between berbera and hargeysa
5573965 and as i am a psychiatrist i know we are all paranoid after the war we are all traumatized we had blood on our hands we fought against a dictator and we killed each other so everybody is paranoid that somebody is following him and we think that if we give up the arms other tribes will attack us let us disarm ourselves and give the arms to the government

5573972 they have one policy for domestic consumption have peace dont use the army
5573973 to this day the military does not see the taliban as an existential threat to pakistan
5573974 we would have liked to receive better results but its something to build on
5573975 hopefully the initiatives weve put in place will help us do this
5573976 if you cant have a hands on experiment in the classroom you have something visual and interactive for the students to use
5573977 obviously we have strong concerns with the results but we have to investigate these results further
5573978 we really need to dig in and figure out whats working and whats not what are schools like st anthony park doing
5573979 its really essential we train our teachers well to deliver higher levels of math and science at an early age
5573980 theres a significant number of people who will not bike to work
5573981 if youre sweaty whos going to sit there in business clothes
5573982 so far nobodys ever said eeeewie go find a shower
5573983 most summer days its about 70 degrees when i get to work so youre not going to get into a huge sweat
5573984 god bless madison avenue they do know how to make a good deodorant in this country
5573985 i never had any complaints from my colleagues about my slovenliness or unpleasant odors coming from my direction
5573986 ive changed my clothes in the bathrooms of some of the better restaurants in the cities
5573987 i usually take what amounts to a bath in a sink in a little used bathroom in the office building
5573988 the thing that was like a breakthrough for me is the really large zip lock bag
5573989 for me a bird bath is where i wash my face and underarms and put on a clean shirt
5573990 you dont advertise that im hot and sweaty and im going to change into my superman outfit
5573991 that is something im really sensitive to the idea that im less than presentable at the office
5573992 you want to look like you didnt ride your bike to work
5573993 one of my co workers called me spiderman for a while
5573994 i kind of joke about it if i smell bad people have to tell me
5573995 in a lot of work environments its cool its trendy its fashionable to ride a bike to work
5573996 it just seems like its a more accepted way to go
5573997 once you get your routine down its as easy as any other way of commuting
5573998 we hope people come down come down often and stay long
5573999 were just trying to think ahead a little bit and keep the options open to keep business running efficiently
5574000 we are just on the outskirts of the security perimeter but you can certainly imagine at the peak times during the event it will be extremely difficult to get down here
5574001 it makes more sense to minimize the number of people we have coming into downtown
5574002 a lot of employees are excited to look out the window and see katie couric or whoever broadcasting from rice park
5574003 for a lot of them this is going to be a really fun event to be part of because they work downtown
5574004 the hurricane season is still a major issue as seen in 2005 with katrina we have to be mindful of that
5574005 we have to watch how it all plays out where the u s dollar would go and where the stocks market is
5574006 the government is in absolute paralysis here or is being perceived as such
5574007 it is being argued that the absence of security restrictions is preventing violence
5574008 but equally and dangerously it is bolstering the separatists and demoralising the forces this way things will get more out of hand each day and leave the government with no option but to eventually come down with a heavy and bloody hand
5574009 senior government servants were among the crowd such is the state of things
5574010 i cant believe we are back to a 1990 like emergency and nobody in new delhi or srinagar has shown any apparent concern
5574011 separatists seem to have the run of the field and it is moving nobody nothing
5574012 the people on the street are no longer content with hartals or being directed from this place to that they want to breach the loc at the very least we are riding a tiger and it has become perilous to dismount it they have turned up in huge numbers on our call now they expect us to do something concrete god forbid if the leadership slips away from us into unknown hands this is a very fluid situation
5574013 dont forget kashmir is not rid of militancy or militants
5574014 they are around watching it takes very little for them to create a flashpoint and give a more radical turn to this a leaderless movement is a dangerous one
5574015 we have been frustrated in the past but not now
5574016 this movement was dead we have resurrected it and now we are going to take it all the way hurriyat or no hurriyat
5574017 but these boys are running away with the agenda they cant be controlled
5574018 we have lived under indian excesses too long the people of kashmir have now risen and expressed their will it is high time we are allowed to decide our own future
5574019 the un should send its peacekeeping forces to kashmir immediately and hold a plebiscite the kashmiris will declare their will to join pakistan
5574020 independence this side of the loc and independence that side
5574021 what were learning is that the financial crisis is far from over and that earnings estimates are probably too high
5574022 when oil and the stock market go down together you know theres real reason to worry
5574023 we are still in the throes of the credit crisis
5574024 theres risk that fannie mae and freddie mac may require capital from the government
5574025 fuck her enjoy her but then regardless of how great it was leave
5574026 now tell me have you ever been fucked up the arse
5574027 i think its really been sad that the president has not been at the sadc summit you know mr mwanawasa had been the sadc chair he was the rotating chairman that is held for about a year and mr mwanawasa had been one of the main critics of the robert mugabe regime so i think his absence might have been felt and im sure that there are certain things that he wanted to mention might have a lot of contributions he would have made if he himself had attended this summit that was held over the weekend in south africa
5574028 his absence may have definitely played a negative role in the negotiations for free and fair or maybe a partial government in zimbabwe because early on zambia was actually considering going to boycott or snub the south africa sadc summit well im sure zambia was supposed to be part of the sadc summit in south africa probably one because zambias outgoing chairperson mr mwanawasa was outgoing chairperson so he was supposed to be there in order to hand over the chair from zambia to south africa who are the incoming chair of the group so if mr mwanawasa was there in person im sure he would have boycotted because like in the case of ian khama president of botswana who says he could not attend because hes not content with the government of robert mugabe so if mr mwanawasa was there in person i dont think he would have taken part or if he had come he would have gone there just because he was supposed to hand over the chairmanship of the 14 member grouping so its really a blow to the negotiations in zimbabwe that president mwanawasa himself did not attend
5574029 there was too much anxiety there was some point where we were told that the president had died so that kind of anxiety had continued in some areas and some people remained concerned but he vice president banda has tried to run the country and maintain peace there might be a few incidents that are taking place but he has used his managerial ability to run the country and maintain law and order
5574030 no matter what that first week theyre always so tired
5574031 its really hard to get them up even that week right before school
5574032 theyre going through a transition and its always an issue for families to gear up and get going
5574033 show children how important school is and that it really takes an effort to be successful
5574034 its good for parents to talk to them about what they expect in the next grade level

5574037 confident parents remarkable kids 8 principles for raising kids youll love to live with
5574038 some are so excited about getting back to school that they are packed
5574039 but there are ones who are more difficult to transition and it does not have anything to do with being resistant or lack of enthusiasm i think all kids need a heads up about whats happening
5574040 if theres chaos in my house in the morning then my whole day is chaotic
5574041 the chaos doesnt just stress me out it stresses the kids out too

5574055 a little girl from south ossetia turned out to be an unsuitable guest for american television news
5574056 how censorship is carried out over who is to blame for the conflict in the caucasus

5574058 theres a quiet room where teachers can have one on one instruction
5574059 ill miss franklin elementary because of the teacher i was going to get
5574060 but its nice to have my daughter in a new school the teachers are more motivated because its new and it relieves the overcrowding in other schools
5574061 they are a little nervous but its going pretty smooth
5574062 we had a kindergarten orientation on friday i like how the kindergarten is separate from the older kids so they feel more comfortable
5574063 ninety nine per cent of settling in visits are done by the mothers on their own so the dads get only the highlights which are normally negative
5574064 it can be hard for the dad because he is one step removed but its also difficult for the mother because she is anxious about returning to work often she is going back the same day and is worried about how she will cope
5574065 we tend not to see babies under six months now
5574066 they tend to be from about ten months old we used to have a lot more full time babies now the average is three days a week bookings go down as maternity pay increases

5574068 ofsted has found that those with the support of ncma are doing well while those without it may be struggling and not understand development issues and play
5574069 you have to be very choosy it is the most important decision you make before your child goes to school
5574070 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
5574071 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
5574072 my boss is totally conflicted about it and pissed hillary is putting us in this position
5574073 we still havent made up our mind and i dont know when we are going to
5574074 the convention is about nominating barack so his people want to speed through the vote as fast as possible so it wont take too much tv time
5574075 they also want to avoid a scenario where shes leading at any point
5574076 im suffering with the long distance but im still happy to do the challenging sport
5574077 that moment on the podium makes it all worthwhile for long distance runners
5574078 perhaps i pushed too hard to come and compete here its a real shame as if i had been really fit i think i would have gone close
5574079 its horrible when you have to drop out its almost quicker to keep going if you stop youre left out there on your own
5574080 im still keeping my fingers crossed for 2012 maybe my body will hold out and i could do that i know in london i will have all that crowd support
5574081 i always wondered what my feelings would be if and when his record would be broken somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps
5574082 abhinavs philosophy was same s t different day and it worked
5574083 he was only 17 then very young and so he had a lot to learn but what helped him is his cool head and his quiet introvert nature
5574084 the fact that he is a philosopher has gone a long way in helping abhinav improve as a shooter technically he was always sound and only needed a bit of a tweak here and there i dont wish to take any of the credit for this gold medal its all entirely his hard work that has paid off
5574085 we trained for seven eight hours a day after which he would come home and spend some time surfing the net or sometimes watching tv or listening to some music before retiring to bed that was our schedule which we followed stringently i was very happy with what i was seeing
5574086 i knew he would do it it was his last shot and i was confident it would be his best
5574087 that was a special moment but that was also the last i saw of him he has been very hassled since then with all the publicity following his win in fact even our next meeting is not fixed yet because we can only do so after he survives the next two weeks of crazy celebrations that are expected when he returns to india

5574093 on november 5 1960 lyndon johnson won election for both the vice presidency of the united states on the kennedy johnson ticket and for a third term as senator he had had texas law changed to allow him to run for both offices when he won the vice presidency he made arrangements to resign from the senate as he was required to do under federal law as soon as it convened on january 3 1961
5574094 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5574095 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5574096 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5574097 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5574098 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5574099 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5574100 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5574101 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5574102 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all

5574106 dieu cay posted articles criticising chinas policy in the south china sea where both the chinese and vietnamese governments claim sovereignty over the spratly and paracel islands
5574107 the vietnamese authorities are copying their chinese neighbours both as regards internet filtering and harassment of internet users we call for dieu cays release

5574109 the eu committed to bind and eliminate duties on ita products in its wto tariff schedules we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5574110 however the eu claims it can now charge duties on these products simply because they incorporate technologies or features that did not exist when the ita was concluded
5574111 in effect the eu is taxing innovation a move that could impair continued technological development in the information technology industry and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers
5574112 ea is saying we want to pay less take two is saying they want more the important thing is that they are talking

5574119 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5574120 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5574121 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5574122 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

5574133 whats been delivered in the end is a good game that ultimately falls just short of its promise due to a few questionable design decisions one thing is for sure though if you love collecting random loot drops youll find a lot to like here
5574134 if you have an insatiable lust for items with higher stats than the ones youre currently using or if you get giddy at the mere thought of diablo style rare item naming conventions youll probably be able to look past the games issues and have a good time but even at its best its hard to ignore too humans monotonous combat and dated approach to cooperative play
5574135 too human is a game of false starts and unrealized potential that infiltrate almost every aspect of the game from story to combat to balance its elements feel stitched together making for a patchwork quilt of a game thats fraying at the seams

5574144 thats part of my job driving in runs and youve got to have guys on base to do that
5574145 its a testament to those guys im just trying to be a complement to the puzzle
5574146 youre not going to win them all but obviously thats one of the better teams in the american league east and the american league for that matter
5574147 his way of managing was his way of managing and during that time you could do it i think he has freely admitted that you couldnt do it now dick talks to me now more than when i was a player
5574148 well just focus on the match we will not be disturbed by the audience

5574150 we only hope he does better next time around his mum is weeping but not for his failure to qualify but for the pain he is going through
5574151 it was important to turn the page and move on which i did
5574152 my advantage was that i wasnt one of the big favourites they had all the media attention
5574153 i knew this was going to be a tough race the 10 km run was going to be the hardest of my life but i just realised this is what i have been dreaming of this is my only chance
5574154 i just had a not very good day on the run
5574155 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5574156 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5574157 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5574158 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5574159 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5574160 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5574161 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5574162 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5574163 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5574164 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5574165 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5574166 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5574167 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5574168 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5574169 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5574170 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5574171 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5574172 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5574173 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5574174 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5574175 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5574176 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5574177 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5574178 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5574179 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5574180 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5574181 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5574182 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5574183 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5574184 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5574185 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5574186 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5574187 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5574188 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5574189 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5574190 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5574191 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5574192 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5574193 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5574194 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5574195 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5574196 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5574197 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5574198 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5574199 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5574200 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5574201 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5574202 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5574203 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5574204 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5574205 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5574206 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5574207 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5574208 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5574209 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5574210 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5574211 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5574212 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5574213 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5574214 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5574215 who are open to doing something on the production side
5574216 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5574217 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5574218 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5574219 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5574220 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5574221 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5574222 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5574223 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5574224 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5574225 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5574226 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5574227 breadth and length and depth and height of the love of christ
5574228 was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man
5574229 tell people something they know already and they will thank you for it tell them something new and they will hate you for it
5574230 in news the rule is that liberals will watch the news and conservatives will watch conservative news a liberal will watch to see what you think the conservative will watch to see how much you agree with him this is why the headline world is so far to the right even of the content
5574231 the sneakiest form of literary subtlety in a corrupt society is to speak the plain truth the critics will not understand you the public will not believe you your fellow writers will shake their heads
5574232 the people of have been led in into a trap from which it will be hard to escape with dignity and honour they have been tricked into it by a steady withholding of information the communiques are belated insincere incomplete things have been far worse than we have been told our administration more bloody and inefficient that the public knows we are today not far from a disaster
5574233 the juicy stories keep popping out like clowns from a clown car
5574234 why dont they talk about the issues were fighting for our lives here
5574235 dai cazzo che non abbiamo tempo da perdere mandaci il tuo merdoso curriculum
5574236 que tira proveito do processamento do pc para encher a tela de inimigos e aumentar a dificuldade e o
5574237 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5574238 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5574239 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5574240 yeah right dad this is what i plan to do when i grow up
5574241 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5574242 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5574243 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5574244 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5574245 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5574246 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5574247 do not go gentle into that good night blog blog against the dying of the light
5574248 no sabemos c mo explicar esto y cuando en el mundo m dico no sabemos como explicar las cosas lo llamamos un milagro eso es lo que probablemente sucedi

5574250 yes juan uribes been that good im not going to play joe just because hes joe crede im going to play the guys out there that do their jobs
5574251 and i think uribes doing a tremendous job right now playing third base and at the plate joes got to go to the minor leagues and give me good at bats
5574252 ill see how he feels tomorrow but this is something that im not really interested in playing around with
5574253 im not going to sit and go through this every night
5574254 a system of general instruction which shall reach every description of our citizens from the richest to the poorest as it was the earliest so will it be the latest of all the public concerns in which i shall permit myself to take interest
5574255 we will prepare children for college the work force or productive citizenship
5574256 im looking forward to all the new teachers and to seeing everyone here
5574257 in my experience people who are victim to sexual abuse as a child rarely get over it it can mean flash backs and memories triggered by something as simple as a smell
5574258 it impacts on people throughout their adult lives and can cause problems with relationships it can also cause difficulties in holding down a job because it can result in people having a mistrust of those in authority
5574259 the judge indicated that there was an overwhelming likelihood green will face an immediate and significant sentence of imprisonment when he is sentenced next month this can only be right and proper given the dreadful abuse he subjected a succession of young boys to
5574260 i would however urge them to either contact the police or speak to me in confidence in order to bring closure to their ordeal
5574261 we have co operated with the authorities since the beginning of the investigation
5574262 it is regrettable when something like this happens our priority and concern is always for the victims
5574263 im in a state of shock and the thought of looking like this at 57 is terrifying
5574264 having seen these images i can honestly say i am never going to use a sunbed again
5574265 you can so easily get brown from a bottle these days there is just no point in ruining your looks and risking skin cancer by using sunbeds
5574266 i hope the horrible image of me will make other young people think twice before they next use a sunbed
5574267 while young people think sunbeds make them look good now in the long term they are doing serious damage to their looks
5574268 julie dropped enough hints for me to realise she wanted me to ask her out so i did i never thought i had a chance because im a bit of a punk and shes gorgeous
5574269 the idea was that she should ride in on a brilliant white harley
5574270 but we quickly realised that it wasnt really very practical
5574271 i had a problem with what to wear for the big day as i dont do suits
5574272 i spend virtually my entire life in biker gear whether working or during my leisure time even i realised this wouldnt be on for the biggest day of my life when i knew julie was going to look wonderful so the solution was a kilt
5574273 part of the family has scottish roots and i love the place so i opted for the murray tartan which i am entitled to wear
5574274 we plan to spend as much time as we can touring on harleys
5574275 from being a teenager i had always hated harleys which i thought were too slow and too expensive
5574276 i travel here daily on the trains and it has become a concern that stealing cabling is virtually epidemic
5574277 the train i travel on is delayed very regularly because people such as this defendant choose to steal the cabling
5574278 the reasons this happens is that the metal from this cabling can command a considerable price
5574279 this sort of offence is happening time and again causing disruption and inconvenience and financial losses to many people who travel on trains in addition there is danger caused to the system of the signalling which is interfered with
5574280 this is a case that needs a deterrent sentence and a message has to go from this court to others who may be minded to behave in the way you have
5574281 he had no idea of the massive inconvenience he had caused to the rail network the 40 50 pales into insignficance against the cost he caused
5574282 once again we see travellers turning to airlines because of problems with the rail network
5574283 imagine what would happen if government moves to increase air taxation forced airlines to discontinue domestic services
5574284 there would be no alternative should the rail network be disrupted and rail operators would not face any competition on pricing
5574285 given the current economic climate it is difficult to say that passengers not using the train have switched to the airlines
5574286 there is no dispute that the substance in question was cocaine the only issue is whether he was in fact snorting it or simply tasting it as he claims
5574287 i saw him holding a piece of paper and two matches to snort the powder
5574288 i believed it was some sort of drug the way he was inhaling it
5574289 it is the most stupid thing i have every done i dont even know what cocaine tastes like and i should never have contemplated putting the powder anywhere near my mouth
5574290 we have four weeks of data so how are we going to adjust a 24 month budget
5574291 its my opinion that the 21 dogs have suffered as a result
5574292 i love animals and i would never throw a dog out on the street things really got out of hand and nobody would take them off me
5574293 current systems often take two or three specially trained soldiers to operate them and cant be used by front line troops where the information is most needed
5574294 the military have an urgent requirement for surveillance support in urban environments and its likely they would deploy any new technology immediately if it was shown to be effective
5574295 men it has been well said think in herds it will be seen that they go mad in herds while they only recover their senses slowly and one by one
5574296 im completely in favor of the separation of church and state my idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own so both of them together is certain death
5574297 miniaturising medical diagnosis technology will bring major advances and it may even be possible for ordinary people to detect potential diseases by themselves just as they can measure their own blood pressure today
5574298 this means for instance breast cancer treatments could be less invasive as the cancer cells presence would be detected at an earlier stage
5574299 i suggest to you that you and mr sanhueza said to him mr guirguis that if he didnt buy the goods you would not give him any more work
5574300 the air med plane was scheduled to arrive at 5 00pm it blew out to 7 30pm and its around 7 00pm or just after 7 00pm that the patient passed away
5574301 its not the primary cause of death but it basically means that he would have been able to get into the hospital environment
5574302 well there was a delay in retrieval ive received a brief on that but i suppose the bottom line is that the gentleman died and thats very sad and my commiserations to his family and to the community but commendation to the health clinic who really tried to resuscitate him
5574303 according to people close to it that death may have been caused by may have been avoidable if the system had have been better
5574304 we live in a situation where we have many many people in remote situations where we cannot provide service on the ground and we need to have a very effective and timely evacuation service so these people can live with the security that they can get access to health care as it is needed
5574305 hopefully people understand the difference between state and federal voting
5574306 hopefully people are very clear when they walk into the ballot box that they need to mark eight boxes on the one voting ticket
5574307 well be arguing the case that we should be number one for the future of the area
5574308 in between the police strike force piccadilly and ourselves we basically made atms too hard a target and not a profitable target to attack
5574309 weve had a number of them attacked and the thieves have abandoned their attack quite quickly once theyve realised theyve been beaten
5574310 when the problem was occurring the clients wanted to have it not too public until they got some of them out in the field and started defeating these ram raiders
5574311 we are looking for an experienced and successful leader to work with the police authority the public and our staff to make the people of cheshire safe
5574312 we are seeking high calibre applications for the post as we need someone who can lead a force which is committed to delivering effective and citizen focused policing
5574313 here are the top ten reasons why i think your church sucks
5574314 well we understand satan has gotten a hold of you and these are not your words but his we will be praying for you and keeping in touch to help you return to gods church
5574315 its hard to be a human being its harder as anything else im lonesome when youre around but im never lonesome when im by myself
5574316 virtue was the most valuable of all possessions the ideal life was spent in search of the good truth lies beneath the shadows of existence and it is the job of the philosopher to show the rest how little they really know
5574317 you pick cards from your friends and if you pick the old maid all your friends point and laugh at you and then wont ever take anymore of your cards
5574318 it demonstrates the taliban have the logistical capability to secure the right weapons for the environment
5574319 the enemy responds with their own improved tactics and better munitions
5574320 we unwrapped her and felt she was moving we didnt believe it at first then she began holding my mothers hand and then we saw her open her mouth
5574321 we let it be known with the dodgers that was the one ballclub he had interest in going to that any deal we were going to do was going to be the best baseball deal we could do and it wasnt going to be a financial deal to try to move dollars we just werent happy with the prospect we would be getting back and we chose to hold onto him
5574322 i traveled to pakistan when i was in college i knew what sunni and shia was sic before i joined the senate foreign relations committee
5574323 the members of this cult who were more than twice her age were calling the shots
5574324 it fits the profile of a classic cult in the sense that its a personality driven group and that queen antoinette is that animating personality and central defining element of the group
5574325 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5574326 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5574327 even the u s military which has a greater number of smart weapons sometimes accidentally hits civilians
5574328 they sent the tu 22 crew to their deaths thinking that the georgian air defense would mount no resistance
5574329 using the tu 22 for a reconnaissance mission over georgia was the same as using a microscope to drive nails
5574330 the victorious russia has found itself in complete isolation that raises the question of whether it was a victory
5574331 georgias military losses were higher than russias but financial political and moral losses of russia were much higher than those of georgia
5574332 beginning to walk but by no means were they running
5574333 if that was a u s brigade it would not have gone into combat
5574334 from what ive heard a lot of the 4th brigade was hit pretty hard
5574335 some of the soldiers seemed really grateful for the things we taught them
5574336 come from the hills of georgia and some of them sign for their paycheck with an x
5574337 overall goal is to bring georgia up to nato standards
5574338 i know specifically that bravo company im sure and i hope from what i did for them that theyre better off than they would have been if this happened four weeks ago
5574339 it was not an absolutely decisive factor whether georgians were trained by americans or not
5574340 what happened was due to the political decision of georgian authorities and not the performance on the ground
5574341 im not saying that were suffering here with the one million thread count sheets or checking out the local females at the pool
5574342 but if our job now is to sit here and put down roots in the couch id rather do it at home

5574345 doctor mwanawasa had been making steady progress until last night when his condition suddenly changed and required intervention
5574346 the team of doctors have reported that the intervention was successful but described the condition of his excellency the president as serious
5574347 the nation will be informed in due course on future developments
5574348 it is above my pay grade to decide when life begins
5574349 well if you come across a paper bag in the
5574350 the money from the drug trade is competing with the institution building which is what these countries need to be doing now
5574351 when there are those in power who are involved in the drug trade its hard to do this
5574352 cops and training are fine but we also need people to come up with things like guns armoured cars and money for informants
5574353 dont even ask about the tush push which was a partner exercise i did during a human sexuality workshop or the very obese female therapist who sat on my head for twenty five minutes at esalen institute so i could re experience being smothered by my mother
5574354 from now on our girls will be freed after their initiation rites so they can go to school
5574355 it was a long process punctuated by prayers and sacrifices to the ancestors
5574356 rites reserved for girls will from now on take place during the holidays
5574357 our troops were clearing the village from booby traps or explosives left by guerillas when the incident occurred
5574358 as long as they could still hear gunshots in the evening
5574359 an assurance for them to return home is when they could see no government soldiers and moro rebels in their midst

5574382 ohne pers nliche kenntnis des gebisszustandes des patienten kann kein verbindliches und fachlich fundiertes vergleichsangebot abgegeben werden
5574383 ein heil und kostenplan f r zahnersatz reicht daf r definitiv nicht aus
5574384 gewohnheiten des patienten wie etwa knirschen oder pressen mit den z hnen werden nicht erfasst au erdem fehlen einzelheiten zur zahnhartsubstanz welches ausma hat die karies sind abriebspuren keilf rmige defekte schliff facetten schmelzrisse oder hnliches vorhanden all dies ist dem internet anbieter nicht bekannt

5574388 i was one of those kids who knew exactly what they were going to do when they grew up
5574389 i knew that i would be in the service it was helicopters and it was going to be the army guard
5574390 what i think about when others see me in an external fashion is that this is not aberrant this can be normal
5574391 to be a helicopter pilot an aviator a national guardsman this is normal and i dont want to be seen as the exception there are women ahead of me im not breaking brush
5574392 its one of those things that reminds of the rigor that goes into the deployment and when you think things are awful they are not
5574393 it helps me remind me how good ive got it sometimes this particular one helps remind me that success is fragile it takes a lot to attain success and once you do its beautiful and exquisite but it doesnt take much to shatter it and break it
5574394 theres a small amount of trepidation that goes with going back into a combat zone but much less than the first time
5574395 this time i know exactly what to expect i can say of the 359 days i spent on the first tour that i could count on two hands how many times i was actually shot at and could count on two fingers the number of times i was probably in mortal danger so out of 359 days those are incredible odds
5574396 one country doesnt want another country to be there they dont want the country to exist so they bomb it

5574413 at stake is more than the crisis in the caucasus but also whether russia and the west can share a core base of values to combat terrorism stop proliferation and promote energy security
5574414 the u s encouraged him without really understanding the nature of the person
5574415 e u is very uncomfortable with the fact that they have invested quite a lot in bringing georgia into the e u neighborhood

5574456 bank sarasin is progressing well along its growth path our strategy along with the associated investments is geared to the long term by pushing ahead with the expansion of our locations and client advisor teams we are consistently pursuing our growth strategy and investing in the long term future of the sarasin group rather than simply trying to maximise our profits in the short term
5574457 for us there are two facets to the results reported for the first half of 2008 first our lower income and profit reflects the very challenging market environment at the same time we were able to build on last year s acquisition success improve our cost efficiency and push ahead with our growth initiatives especially the launch of bank zweiplus the expansion of our offices in switzerland as well as the obtaining of licenses in germany bahrain qatar and oman show that we are making good progress at all our locations we are well equipped for the future
5574458 our acquisition performance of chf 5 2 billion on the operating side is higher than our original expectations and the target we set ourselves thus we are building on last year s success
5574459 although these new advisors have already signed contracts with us
5574460 most of them will only start work in the final quarter of 2008 and will not therefore make a positive impact on revenues until 2009 onwards
5574461 at the same time we need to take action to improve our profitability
5574462 on the one hand the investments in initiatives to assure our long term success will start to bear fruit in the next few years and have a positive impact on our results on the other hand we have taken measures to further improve our cost efficiency such as the launch of bank zweiplus or improving the ratio between front and back office capacities we are well equipped for the future

5574471 die bank sarasin h lt ihren wachstumskurs unsere strategie und die damit einhergehenden investitionen sind langfristig angelegt mit dem forcierten ausbau unserer standorte und kundenberaterteams setzen wir nicht auf kurzfristige gewinnmaximierung sondern verfolgen nachhaltig unsere wachstumsstrategie und investieren langfristig in die zukunft der sarasin gruppe
5574472 das 1 halbjahr 2008 hat f r uns zwei seiten zum einen widerspiegelt sich das schwierige marktumfeld in einer schw cheren ertragskraft und einem reduzierten gewinn gleichzeitig konnten wir gemessen am neugeld an unsere akquisitionserfolge des letzten jahres ankn pfen unsere kosteneffizienz verbessern und unsere wachstumsinitiativen allen voran die bank zweiplus vorantreiben der ausbau in der schweiz und die erteilung der lizenzen in deutschland bahrain katar und oman zeigen dass es an allen standorten vorw rts geht wir sind damit f r die zukunft ger stet
5574473 liegt unsere operative akquisitionsleistung mit chf 5 2 mia ber den urspr nglichen erwartungen und dem definierten zielkurs wir bleiben damit in der erfolgsspur des letzten jahres
5574474 obgleich diese neuen kundenberater ihre vertr ge bereits unterschrieben haben
5574475 werden sie gr sstenteils erst im letzten quartal 2008 ihre stelle antreten und damit erst ab 2009 ihre st rke f r uns entfalten
5574476 zum einen werden sich die investitionen in langfristig angelegte wachstumsinitiativen in den n chsten jahren auszahlen und positiv im ergebnis niederschlagen zum anderen haben wir beispielsweise mit der bank zweiplus oder der verbesserung des verh ltnisses zwischen back und front office massnahmen f r die weitere steigerung unserer kosteneffizienz ergriffen wir sind damit f r die zukunft ger stet

5574495 what originally started as a screenplay about a simple power outage think irwin allen
5574496 developed over the years into a story about good and evil the novel itself was going to be more of a character study on how a small town deals with a power outage that goes on and on but then the zombies showed up all on their own
5574497 the story goes beyond mere gore and some undead folks eating some live folks
5574498 while it can certainly be enjoyed as pop horror fiction which is just how the author likes it the true heart of the novel rests in the hope the characters are searching for each character must find their own source of hope and not just survive overcoming the evils within themselves is the driving force of the survivors

5574559 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
5574560 every production bird in the world is required to be vaccinated and since virogens vaccine is breakthrough technology and the most effective innovo patent protected product on the market the company anticipates it will capture this exclusive market for several years with approximately 45 billion birds being produced annually outside of the united states and consumption growing by close to 30 per annum and expected to increase further one can anticipate the revenue opportunity for this vaccine is in the tens of millions over the product life cycle
5574561 this new facility is intended to propel the college of business to the next level of academic excellence and the facilitys wireless network is critical to the realization of that vision
5574562 based on the experience we gained since launching our first campus wide wireless network in 2000 under project nomad it was clear that arubas systems approach to wireless networking really stood apart rf design is only one element in a multi dimensional problem that includes bandwidth management client steering guest access encryption access control and network management among others arubas 802 11n solution delivered the best performance was the easiest to use and manage and offered the highest available security in my book that lays a solid foundation on which we can build a world class learning center
5574563 recent tests conducted by aruba show that our standards based 802 11n solutions extract the best performance from 802 11n enabled laptops allowing faculty and students alike to make the most of this new technology
5574564 if you build a state of the art facility you dont want the learning experience sullied by poor wi fi performance due to driver incompatibility or nearby interference we have taken pains to enable our 802 1n networks to adapt to the environment in which they operate the result is that it staff can focus on learning initiatives without distraction

5574568 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
5574569 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
5574570 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
5574571 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

5574854 weve been to that complex many many times and given enforcement notices and typically people comply
5574855 and sometimes the grills come back out after a couple of days
5574856 we can see both sides of the argument but in the end all grilling should be done in an open area away from buildings or underneath eaves
5574857 theres a saying that there are three kinds of people that cause fires men women and children
5574858 when you put a grill on the back deck have it on the far side away from home instead of up next to the house
5574859 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5574860 concerned citizens have called the dep with questions but have not received much response or assistance with their concerns
5574861 but if we find that we do not have adequate regulations dealing with these environmental concerns of the marcellus shale drilling then first the dep has the right to impose emergency rules and second the legislature has the right to confirm the appropriate rules
5574862 quiero denunciar y manifestar mi indignaci n por las presiones que ciertas personas est n ejerciendo contra locatarios de patronato a quienes obligaron a firmar un documento donde aceptaban poner carteles en beneficio de la candidata de la alianza

5574866 if they heard how much good hes done theres no way they could have let him resign let alone gotten rid of him

5574868 he is the perfect man to teach those classes hes the heart and soul of the ffa he wasnt really a teacher he was a mentor
5574869 were dealing with a man that cares about his students
5574870 i just feel very sorry for students who wont get the same opportunity i did
5574871 people respect him and admire him you dont come across that every day his students are his life
5574872 for the school board not to hear what they just lost is really a mistake

5574886 its unheard of that an application of that magnitude would be accepted on the first time its being seen at the national review

5574905 aplican recargos innecesarios en los precios de los billetes de ryanair que en ocasiones llegan al 200 de incremento
5574906 no informar a los usuarios de los t rminos y condiciones de ryanair tampoco les informan de la situaci n actualizada o cambios en los vuelos y retrasan el funcionamiento de la web con conexiones masivas
5574907 seg n la normativa vigente es la compa a a rea la que est obligada a informar al cliente de las modificaciones o cancelaciones
5574908 las agencias on line siempre facilitan a las compa as a reas los datos de contacto de los clientes y las condiciones y t rminos de vuelo
5574909 en ning n momento se establece una relaci n contractual entre las agencias y ryanair
5574910 la ley faculta a las agencias la intermediaci n en reservas de servicios tur sticos
5574911 se ajustan a lo que marca la ley en espa a por el concepto gastos de gesti n al ofrecer la informaci n de todas las ofertas del mercado
5574912 detr s de estas declaraciones ryanair intenta ocultar a la opini n p blica y a sus inversores su supuestamente delicada situaci n econ mica
5574913 cancelar un importante n mero de reservas realizadas y pagadas directamente por el viajero a ryanair habiendo sido utilizados voluntariamente los servicios de mediaci n de las agencias de viajes
5574914 corresponder a mayoritariamente a reservas realizadas con mucha antelaci n y bajo precio para ponerlas nuevamente a la venta a precio actual que estar a muy por encima del precio pagado inicialmente

5574916 va a defender este derecho y est estudiando las acciones legales que puedan adoptarse para la mejor defensa de los intereses de los consumidores
5574917 incompresiblemente esta aerol nea que dice tener los mejores precios del mercado parece no desear que los consumidores puedan a trav s de la agencias comparar su oferta con la de otras compa as
5574918 nuestra pr ctica es absolutamente transparente y l cita y redunda en beneficio del consumidor creemos que ryanair persigue crear una clima de desconfianza hacia los portales online para intentar canalizar la venta de sus billetes de avi n a trav s de su propia p gina web evitando as la comparaci n de precios y discrimin ndonos simplemente por ser agencias online
5574919 the purpose of this site is to help show where crime is occurring at a local neighbourhood level it has been developed by the mps in conjunction with the metropolitan police authority and the mayor of london this is a live test site known technically within the industry as a beta
5574920 as a kid i always loved to play pretend and act like somebody i wasnt so when i learned about the drama program at my school i was thrilled to audition for some of the plays
5574921 it was a farce of the legend of robin hood so i got to pay a clumsy robin hood which i really enjoyed
5574922 its exhilarating to perform in front of a crowd i dont really notice the audience at first but i know theyre out there and i try my best to make an outstanding performance
5574923 we got to take a tour of the watchtower printing plant in wallkill n y
5574924 im here with the 99th infantry division of ww2 for their 59th reunion
5574925 someone come quick my wife fell asleep on the couch with her mouth open and a mouse ran down her throat
5574926 wave a piece of cheese over her mouth and maybe the mouse will come out an ambulance is on the way
5574927 didnt the 911 operator tell you to wave a piece of cheese over your wifes mouth
5574928 archery i did it at camp and i have a blast doing it its really unique
5574929 that was one of my biggest worries getting away from the classroom
5574930 i look at george usevich and how hes run this building its incredible how many kids he manages to know on a first name basis
5574931 he obviously has his own style and ill have to develop my own
5574932 tom knows the job the best and knows my leadership style
5574933 he has a solid understanding of the staff and cuts across a lot of different groups which is very important
5574934 i think in his 10 years here hes developed a great trust within the staff
5574935 norwood really prompted it because i was familiar with the town and its music program
5574936 this is a great school and my goal is to provide the stability and continuity that has been here over the years
5574937 whoa whoa whoa you mean theirs consequences for voting for socialists all the time
5574938 prior to that it had been for sale for years just languishing with very bad roof leaks
5574939 i have a basic interest in architecture and historic renovation and i saw it as a shame not to do something with it
5574940 i have become disillusioned and disappointed by the whole thing
5574941 the problem is movie theaters are not giant halls anymore
5574942 and we cant be thinking with our love struck eyes we know there is not a need for a foreign film house with that many seats
5574943 adaptive reuse is something i think we should think about with the miller
5574944 i mean do we want to save a theater or a historic building would a chilis across the street from the imperial be sad perhaps but not as sad as a gravel parking lot
5574945 for many we became familiar with the immunizations and issues that affect the health of children but along the way we have left out our teenagers
5574946 this is a way to bring an awareness of what adolescents need such as boosters to remain healthy and protected
5574947 we wanted them to represent the teen voice and let us know what teens are thinking and how they are feeling about topics such as gardasil and hpv
5574948 it makes it a well rounded awareness event by including them
5574949 my really good friends and i have something we can talk about
5574950 i believe we never really know a goal is attainable until were challenged
5574951 he has an open mind willing to listen and learn and work within the ebb and flow of the nations pulse
5574952 bounced around telling the truth as he knows it and being honest about why he changes
5574953 when he does change he does so very directly and very forthrightly
5574954 clicking on the headline or the image which is really being loaded from the bbc web site will take e mail readers to a virus laden web page
5574955 the danger is that almost no anti virus products detected this virus when it began to be distributed this morning only 4 of 36 anti virus products knew that this was a suspicious file in our tests this morning
5574956 several of the computers being used to send the new spam campaign are in russia including at least one computer owned by the federal agency of education
5574957 these spam messages serve a dual purpose a propaganda attack against georgia while adding compromised hosts to botnets controlled by pro russian individuals
5574958 to adopt sufficient powers to effectively prevent and combat such offenses by facilitating their detection investigation and prosecution at both the domestic and international levels and by providing arrangements for fast and reliable international cooperation
5574959 b pap for example is supporting it order to sell the country better to investors and ensure they are very wel covered when it comes to cybersecurity in the philippines
5574960 definitely there is increased support this time but its really in the hands of lawmakers we are always on call if they need clarification about the proposed bill
5574961 een gemiddelde auto zoals een opel astra of een volkswagen golf kost elk jaar 4 974 euro
5574962 wanneer een gezin met twee kinderen ouder dan twaalf min of meer dezelfde verplaatsingen met het openbaar vervoer wil doen is het meer dan 10 000 euro per jaar kwijt
5574963 ons doelpubliek is het woon werkverkeer en het woon schoolverkeer voor die mensen hebben we w l interessante tarieven de gemiddelde prijs voor een gezin ligt hier tussen de 1 200 en de 1 300 euro per jaar
5574964 maar onze bussen en trams zijn het goedkoopst van heel europa
5574965 we doen ontzettend veel voor die groepen als gebruikers van onze instellingen maar niet in ons personeelsbestand
5574966 maar nog slechts 5 procent er zijn kindercr ches in de steden met tot 45 verschillende nationaliteiten onder de kindjes maar met maar 1 werknemer met allochtone roots
5574967 de overdreven diplomavereisten die de overheid oplegt als subsidievoorwaarde zijn een belangrijke rem de gebrekkige taalkennis van kandidaten ook maar dat betekent niet dat het niet anders kan we g n dat veranderen
5574968 het verkeer maakt elk jaar duizend doden en bijna 60 000 gewonden mensen moeten begrijpen dat het niet onmogelijk is om dat aantal naar beneden te krijgen want we kennen de oorzaken van die ongevallen snelheid alcohol drugs geen gordel
5574969 ik ga er bij de gewesten op aandringen dat ze de automatische snelheidscontroles verhogen
5574970 vooral in walloni moeten er meer flitspalen komen al moeten we wel verstandiger omspringen met de snelheidsbeperking er staan te veel borden aan de kant van de weg
5574971 met elektronische borden moet je de snelheid omlaag halen op de gevoelige punten net na de schooluren of bij het begin van een toneelvoorstelling op de snelwegen moeten we overwegen om in slechte weersomstandigheden 110 km per uur te verplichten
5574972 er is een mentaliteitswijziging nodig maar dat alleen is niet genoeg ik wil het niet zoeken in het verhogen van de boetes de pakkans moet omhoog het moet ons doel zijn dat elk jaar n op de tien automobilisten eens gecontroleerd is onder meer op het dragen van de gordel of alcohol en druggebruik
5574973 random house is afraid of terrorism so we are canceling the jewel of medina
5574974 life is a beast you just get on it and ride
5574975 as long as i am not expected to support it i am pretty hands off
5574976 obamas challenge americas economic crisis and the power of a transformative presidency
5574977 chelsea green publishing has taken an unprecedented action to restrict the availability of robert kuttners obamas challenge by giving one company a two week exclusivity period
5574978 because it was the only way we could get advanced reading copies to the democratic national convention on time and make the book available on the first day of the convention aug 25
5574979 this is part of a strategy to get the buzz going so that demand will escalate and the copies will sell through at all outlets when the main printing arrives
5574980 theres no such thing as off the record anymore theres no such thing as private moments anymore
5574981 this is the condition of life now in the new media age
5574982 its an amazing opportunity for us you dont get all these people in one place but every four years
5574983 we recognize its a whole new world out there with bloggers but were really embracing it
5574984 its so many more channels to get our message out
5574985 people are starting to go directly to the web site or use bookmarks if they know what theyre looking for rather than using a portal
5574986 google is best positioned to take advantage of this trend while the rest are struggling to maintain relevancy
5574987 instead of focusing on the consumer experience yahoos energies were tied up fighting off a hostile takeover bid in that time yahoo lost several key managers and consumer perceptions may have been adversely affected by extensive negative press surrounding the merger
5574988 and attorney hendrix covers a variety of well reasoned points
5574989 every good trial lawyer knows that a jury remembers best that which they both hear and see
5574990 accordingly demonstrative exhibits should always be used during closing argument sometimes demonstrative exhibits are necessary in order to emphasize a point about liability sometimes they are used to emphasize principles of law
5574991 just about everyone is familiar with powerpoint and it is eminently capable of displaying absolutely anything so why go out and look for legal presentation programs that can cost a lot of money and take hours of valuable time to learn when you already have the perfect software package using powerpoint for court and the software and material found on the resource cd you will be on the cutting edge of courtroom presentation technology and will have the winning edge over the opposing side
5574992 theories should be as simple as possible but no simpler
5574993 all other things being equal the simplest solution is the best
5574994 many countries have anti discrimination laws in the books which need proper implementation although few among us may be actually blamable for racism but as a society all of us are morally accountable
5574995 yes we have an elmo do you need a projector and screen with that too
5574996 we the peoples alliance for democracy feel that thaksin and his wife should return to thailand to face the charges being brought against them
5574997 should they seek political asylum any democratic country should not allow them to ignore the law of thailand
5574998 we introduce a way to relate wind stretch to dry air and dust which correlate very well with humidity in the western tropical atlantic
5574999 the index we proposed may provide practical implications for the prediction of atlantic hurricane activities
5575000 on a regular basis to an audience whose approval they seek with material that is about as exciting as a wet newspaper
5575001 the effective trial lawyer will continue to rely on the timeless tactics of credibility emotional appeals and logic but in order to effectively persuade a jury the trial lawyer must deliver the case themes and facts in a way that is consistent with how jurors process information in our high technology age indeed jurors have come to expect it even when the traditional is large enough for a jury to actually read in itself a rarity the old techniques are simply not enough to keep a jurys or a judges attention
5575002 he knew enough about technology to check his blackberry for email messages and well that was pretty much it
5575003 on the fly in the courtroom or preplan the presentation before trial the document can then be presented side by side with the video deposition with the transcript flowing line by line under the video image
5575004 this is no different than having the opposing council stand in front of a whiteboard reading your clients depositon while flipping through enlarged documents this is cleaner and faster i like it and ill allow it overruled
5575005 counsel would you have the same objection is plaintiffs counsel went up to the board and drew a picture of the highway showing all the trees
5575006 then you shouldnt have any problem with this either overruled
5575007 i think its a lot of riders coming back to riding after a long break or getting into it for the first time
5575008 maybe they lack the experience of hard core riders but theyre definitely overestimating their abilities theyre not that young anymore their reflexes are not as good and their vision is not as good
5575009 not quite what we had when i was a kid but i digress anyway think for a minute
5575010 even in very complex high stakes cases it often makes sense sense to do things in house as simple graphics often convey a message better than more complex ones complex overly professional graphics can send the wrong message i e that a particular side is too well funded or that youre trying to pull one over on the jury in light of these concerns the trial lawyer may choose to do nothing more sophisticated for a graphics presentation than stand in front of a large tablet with a wide black or red or green marker
5575011 in most cases you have at least one demonstrative exhibit that will will shock or wow the jury a common mistake is to overexpose that picture to the jury thereby desensitizing them to it another way to do that it to put a black border tape around all of your foam core exhibits except for he one exhibit put red border tape around that exhibit when your foam core boards are leaning up against the wall the jury will see that they all have black border tape except for the one that will heighten their curiosity in seeing that exhibit after they have seen the exhibit and the boards are leaning up against the wall they will notice the red border standing out among the black borders and it will remind them of the exhibit without even seeing the picture
5575012 beware of playing tape recordings for a jury criminal cases often include audio or video taped interviews many times these recordings are not clear either because of the quality of sound the presence of static or interference or even the size of the courtroom making listening difficult i am watching a capable prosecutor try to punctuate his closing argument in a sexual assault on a child case by playing portions of the defendants audio taped statement using his own words against him my courtroom is a large cave sound is often muffled and unintelligible the prosecutor is frustrated in his playing of the tape although he has taken great care to transfer the portions of the statement to his computer unfortunately the speakers the corruption of the sound recording and the size of the courtroom have made it impossible for the jury to hear clearly thus having little impact perhaps the prosecutor should have simply read a transcript of the defendants words to the jury to illustrate his point contrast this with the very end of a closing argument in another assault case a few weeks ago there one of the victims was video taped during her review of a photo array of potential suspects as she looked at each photograph she took her time and placed each photo on the desk when she did not recognize the person that is until she saw the defendants photograph her reaction was immediate and extreme the prosecutor ended her closing argument by replaying only those last seconds of the video without comment the strength of that presentation left a major impact on the jury moral dont be tempted to use technology any technology unless it makes your presentation clear
5575013 when youre watching a hitchcock movie for most of the movie you are playing the guessing game whats the endgame whats the plot how are these people involved its the best way to tell the story and as a viewer thats what you want to experience
5575014 i am 78 and too old to contest any election
5575015 i wont be contesting any political elections but i will undertake bsps poll campaign in all 33 districts of rajasthan from next month till the polls are held
5575016 in 2004 the congress ruled 14 states and now it just has four in its control it is the leadership which is responsible for the partys fate
5575017 i will honestly work for the bsp in elections to defeat congress and bjp
5575018 mayawatis party has future and young leadership to take the nation forward
5575019 that has unfortunately become the norm in almost all powerpoint presentations from the classroom to the boardroom to the courtroom
5575020 the concept is almost too simple which is probably why youve never heard of it
5575021 twitter said that it simply cant afford to support long distance sms twittering anymore and the company claims

5575024 recalls brights mother kim archie now executive director of the national cheer safety foundation ncsf
5575025 everyone needs to ask themselves is cheerleading worth not being able to walk again
5575026 on a local level everyone involved must be sure safety precautions are in place athletic directors coaches parents the girls themselves
5575027 they need to know they have a responsibility to speak up if risks are being taken
5575028 i speak for the majority of her family when i say her presence will not be missed by many very few tears will be shed and there will be no lamenting over her passing
5575029 but i truly believe at the end of the day all of us will really only miss what we never had a good and kind mother grandmother and great grandmother
5575030 as for the rest of us left behind i hope this is the beginning of a time of healing and learning to be a family again
5575031 there will be no service no prayers and no closure for the family she spent a lifetime tearing apart we cannot come together in the end to see to it that her grandchildren and great grandchildren can say their goodbyes so i say here for all of us good bye mom
5575032 its an extremely tough environment and with overcapacity and global downturn the situation is going to get even more challenging

5575037 the tanaiste deputy prime minister and cowen were there on the friday night before the talks broke down but their contribution was very limited
5575038 in contrast ahern would seem to have had more contact with the process he would have tried to put something on the table
5575039 there has been a lot of criticism of him not doing it sooner but he wanted to see how things would pan out
5575040 we believe this is a quicker and more effective way of discouraging this unlawful activity and we hope that by getting rid of screen scrapers we will speed up passenger processing times on ryanair com as well as ensuring that ryanair passengers are not paying unnecessary handling charges or higher fares to screen scrapers
5575041 has confirmed that it has discontinued screen scraping the ryanair com web site as part of legal proceedings filed against both it and its parent company bravofly sa
5575042 the second recent success ryanair has scored against screen scraping web sites and follows ryanairs successful injunction against v tours to prevent them from screen scraping ryanairs website in germany

5575052 youd be surprised how much flooding has been caused by soccer balls and basketballs
5575053 all we can do is fan out in areas we know are likely to flood
5575054 a long soaking rain would be good for the area but if its a lot at once it could be a problem
5575055 if we get the rain without the wind well be fine
5575056 right now it looks like a severe thunderstorm that will last a while
5575057 i think what were looking at is a fair amount of water if the winds get too strong we cant run the buses were watching it
5575058 the idea that apple can choose what functionality my applications should have frightens me
5575059 how about legislation that requires a mandatory kill switch be integrated into every human being so that the police can kill an individual without even needing to dispatch an officer to a scene
5575060 this helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites products and internet services are of most interest to them
5575061 thats the holy grail by continually monitoring how consumers are using the phone they are able to be super responsive to glitches
5575062 i flew in two days ago to prepare the boat
5575063 not much to do on a dock like this but add extra lines and make sure the boat can rise and fall with the tide
5575064 this isnt a hurricane if the media wasnt down here hyping this up this would be a non event
5575065 they should continue to stay calm and be smart and make sure they exercise common sense
5575066 i compare this the talks to a shattered glass it would be very difficult to put the pieces together
5575067 we have already freed the towns we are on pursuit operations we will not stop until we catch up with them
5575068 they killed innocent defenceless civilians people are traumatized we need food medicines we want the soldiers here
5575069 will defend them at all costs against any move by any group that will disrupt our aspirations for a genuine and lasting peace

5575077 al qaida has found a haven in tikrit and was given assistance by saddams tribe
5575078 coalition forces disrupted an aqi al qaida in iraq bombing network in the tigris river valley during two related operations
5575079 in baghdad coalition forces captured a wanted man and one associate reportedly working for the aqi foreign terrorist facilitation network that has developed in the city
5575080 the long term outcomes of the current russian georgian war will be felt far and wide from afghanistan to iran and from the caspian to the mediterranean
5575081 the war is a mid sized earthquake which indicates that the geopolitical tectonic plates are shifting and nations in the middle east including israel need to take notice
5575082 u s expressions of support of the kind provided to georgia short of an explicit mutual defense pact may or may not result in military assistance if when israel is under attack especially when the attacker has an effective deterrent such as nuclear arms deliverable against u s targets
5575083 in the future such an attacker could be iran or an arab country armed with atomic weapons israel can and should rely on its own deterrent a massive survivable second strike capability
5575084 this is something to remember when looking at recent american intelligence assessments of the iranian nuclear threat or the unsuccessful training of palestinian authority security forces against hamas
5575085 stake in the smooth flow of oil from the caspian
5575086 this use of small ethnically based proxies is similar to irans use of hizbullah and hamas to continuously attack israel
5575087 tbilisi tried for years to deal with these militias by offering a negotiated solution including full autonomy within georgia
5575088 clearly with the renewal of east west tensions as a result of russias moves against georgia it will be much more difficult to obtain moscows agreement to enhance sanctions and international pressures on iran
5575089 the struggle to diplomatically halt its irans nuclear program will become far more difficult
5575090 the kingdom has not been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the united states
5575091 although i approved the settlements i did so without being aware of the considerations that now impel me to disapprove them
5575092 the wounds of 9 11 will not easily be assuaged but neither should they be exacerbated by rich rewards of fees and benign indifference to unreasonably large awards

5575107 i like the way that when we had our whole roster here we had a series of six games and we won all six
5575108 i feel real good about our positioning right now the key is can we get back to that form once the games begin we have eight games left five on the road we have to find a way to bring our best
5575109 were missing those four people but those four have to come back ready
5575110 they have to jell with the other eight players its going to be tough i did experience that transition before and its a hard grind but agler is not trying to wear us out either
5575111 the eight players that are here we have to hold it down and take care of business we understand they are going to be tired but we also understand they have a great team that everybody is not playing so many minutes
5575112 hoping whats going on and reality are two different things
5575113 its a tough deal when you see they are up by 40 and shes playing 30 plus minutes its hard but they are on a mission and i am sure they are trying to make their decision based on trying to win a gold medal

5575170 is utilized as a vehicle to forward money to the ltte liberation tigers of tamil eelam from canada
5575171 the 83 page financial report is the fruit of two years of analysis of banking records seized by canadian anti terrorism police who are investigating a financial network run by supporters of the tamil tigers that allegedly raised money in canada to buy arms for the guerrillas
5575172 the bank records seized demonstrate that the world tamil movement has developed an elaborate machine like entity that moves throughout the greater toronto area collecting funds with extreme proficiency
5575173 whether through luck or skill or both what apple has been great at is combining innovation with a great feel for what the marketplace would respond to then backing that up with reasonable service

5575175 i think apple will still be on top but others will think of something to avoid further declines

5575182 we are cubs fans an unofficial journal of baseballs best fans
5575183 to have a store like that in naperville support you is really incredible
5575184 i took a class in college and that inspired a passion for it
5575185 the amazing thing about living across the street from wrigley is whether theyre good or bad the ballpark is still filled
5575186 there are so many people who come day after day
5575187 but the overall theme of every cub fan is the hope the belief and the anticipation
5575188 one was that the entire layout and design is all my own
5575189 we were really able to portray what i wanted to show
5575190 we are cubs fans an unofficial journal of baseballs best fans
5575191 genevas historic center is a source of pride to residents and an attractive walkable commercial district to visitors historic preservation has always played an important role in maintaining the citys authentic sense of place this discussion is critical in determining the future of historic preservation in geneva
5575192 if were going to put this much money into our facility we dont want to just put a band aid on it
5575193 in terms of the immediate need our food pantries are seeing about a 20 percent increase in the amount of people going into them
5575194 more people than ever before in kendall and kane counties need help today
5575195 especially with so much state and federal funding being cut it is both important and gratifying when corporations such as caterpillar and its employees step up in this manner
5575196 we have too many hungry and homeless people in the fox valley too many kids at risk too many seniors needing assistance the dollars fox valley united way collects help ease a lot of hurt
5575197 i have concerns about whats going to be said and im not going to call her
5575198 i was mad at the ex boyfriend we had an argument
5575199 the deal is contingent on her cooperating and testifying if she is called as a witness
5575200 she fully cooperated with them and did everything they asked
5575201 i think everyone will admit that hes certainly put his heart and soul into it and had some really impressive results out of it
5575202 i feel good about the year and im very appreciative of the board for recognizing that
5575203 theres no real consensus theres no candidate thatll make everybody happy
5575204 depending on where you are from and where your allegiance has been will help determine that
5575205 this has been a great privilege to work on behalf of the people of illinois for over 35 years
5575206 emil jones is a man with a big heart and a man of action he is a true champion of the people
5575207 he didnt just do the talk he did the walk all of us in illinois owe him a great debt of gratitude
5575208 first of all i have taken a county lake county and turned it from bright red to pale blue
5575209 i have probably added more democrats to the senate than anybody else ive shown my ability in that area
5575210 as your paper has reported i had no involvement in it this has nothing to do with me
5575211 weve been to that complex many many times and given enforcement notices and typically people comply
5575212 and sometimes the grills come back out after a couple of days
5575213 we can see both sides of the argument but in the end all grilling should be done in an open area away from buildings or underneath eaves
5575214 theres a saying that there are three kinds of people that cause fires men women and children
5575215 were working with our attorney about tightening up our ordinances to have people remove the stuff from their yards from the emerald ash borer the trees and the stumps
5575216 i agree 100 percent that a hazardous tree should come down
5575217 we have not exercised that authority for the emerald ash borer infestation to date all removed have been voluntary
5575218 early removal will if nothing else retard the rate at which they are ultimately going to have to reduce trees
5575219 the law is quite clear that they could have worded the question for any election and it automatically would then go to the next one
5575220 however they chose in wording this to say next election and clearly the next election was february
5575221 i think it the suit is indicative of whats really going on in the village and that is we have a law firm that has created this thing and will do whatever is needed to protect it
5575222 we intend to follow the law and are going to protect our dissolution petition
5575223 we think the village had every right to defend its own existence but since these people stepped up there was no need to have the village involved
5575224 you have to understand the trauma the family was under
5575225 they were asleep in the middle of the night theyre terrified as you can imagine and bound and gagged it was extremely difficult
5575226 there were a lot of ways this could have gone badly we should all be thankful were not looking at a multiple homicide
5575227 they were at the scene for a very long time its a different kind of a crime scene than when a single person breaks in when no one is home is there for a few moments and leaves
5575228 the village has a long history of hunting down its perpetrators
5575229 the question is can we be doing other things with that money
5575230 but my fear is were going to have to go to the well again and again and again for other stuff for the village and we will
5575231 no one is indispensable and the roof of city hall did not and will not collapse
5575232 youre putting a 50 foot wide home on a 60 foot wide lot
5575233 all youre going to see is a sea of rooftops because the houses are so close together
5575234 batavia is postured that when the u s economy comes roaring back were going to be in a real strong position here to do some great things
5575235 when you put a grill on the back deck have it on the far side away from home instead of up next to the house
5575236 if it was a different time and a different economy maybe
5575237 i dont think our residents will think less of us for not buying these its just not the right time
5575238 sometimes we do things in the name of the environment or because its politically correct and it doesnt make economic sense
5575239 what will the resale of these cars be i have no idea
5575240 will the batteries last six years or 12 years i dont know the cars just havent been around long enough
5575241 the question is do we want to be a leader or a follower
5575242 historically arlington heights has been a leader this is a big issue we should be a leader
5575243 this isnt a research based decision its a budget based one
5575244 pulling our aides is opening the door for the district to keep taking from this successful program
5575245 as we were looking through our budget processes and staffing reviews we saw that this did not meet the standard of a 27 to 1 student teacher ratio for bilingual programs
5575246 mr cortez was our helper teacher and now his job is gone he helped us with many things with math and with the birthday parties i miss him every day
5575247 we made a decision to enroll our kids in this school to drive seven miles each way just for this program i wont see it dismantled
5575248 to state how much i regret that we are in the midst of this controversy we should have explained to parents teachers and principal what we intended to do before the school year and in writing with a full explanation of our decision and process
5575249 theres a lot of excitement in that school because theres going to be quite a transformation
5575250 i dont know what would be a bigger reason to opt out than that its more expensive
5575251 it is my belief many of them are getting a pass when it comes to sensitivity training and psychological evaluations
5575252 it is a big commitment and we do recognize that there are other sports out there
5575253 its a team sport and it develops hand eye coordination and develops confidence
5575254 we have an awesome banquet at years end that we hand out awards at we have certified coaches
5575255 its a little unbelievable that the kids would bowl a 300
5575256 i think we run one of the best youth leagues around we provide them some of the best coaching around
5575257 this is too important to leave it up to bake sales and other fundraisers
5575258 we need to step up and find a stable funding mechanism
5575259 these extra funds will help us stay here and continue to provide these services
5575260 without it were looking at some serious financial concerns next year
5575261 its important that people who choose to participate in the criminal justice system fund this and not the law abiding citizens
5575262 there is no foreclosure at the moment theres a notice thats been posted i dont really have any other comments there should be no real changes for the residents
5575263 we dont want it to happen again and disrupt service
5575264 m let m v re at vi fremover har samme v kstprocenter som vi har haft n r vi kigger tilbage selvom oddsene er sv rere p grund af demografien s m jeg sige at det er med til at skabe dynamik og fremdrift i samfundet at vi har en v kstprocent af en vis st rrelse
5575265 how many people getting shot or killed is it going to take
5575266 if other people can shut them down why cant we
5575267 when these guys are robbing these places are they carrying out big bags of stuffed rabbits
5575268 of course not theyve got cash they have to know theyre paying out
5575269 everyone else around is at risk when theres a robber
5575270 its in our neighborhood in a lot of towns thats not the case here theyre amid our homes
5575271 there are some people that are pretty doggone tired of that and i think they have a reason to be

5575276 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour

5575278 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
5575279 when they were being swept downstream by the current they would reach up to grab branches to try to save themselves and what would happen is they would end up with a handful of leaves because the force of the current would strip the branches through their hands and it wasnt until they were slammed into trees that they could grab onto a tree to keep from being pulled downstream
5575280 and when i looked up you could see the bridge still because the lights were on but there was no bridge that night because it was all water coming at you

5575285 cost for ordinary americans are soaring for energy for food for healthcare increasingly they have financed those costs with flats waged through debt which has contributed we all know to the home mortgage crisis and many other debt crunches i think are still going to come at us in waves over the next couple of years
5575286 i want to make sure our children and grandchildren will still have a planet
5575287 energy is at the heart of the three greatest challenges us faces today
5575288 the president made it clear its not a question of money its allowing the great free enterprises to work all we have to do in washington is make tax credits renewable
5575289 i try to do simple things like turning off lights and making sure we have energy efficient appliances

5575295 sen mccain is expected to host a rally on august 29 in dayton and is looking for a big venue and for a big crowd hell get it this is not yet public i guess i just made it so
5575296 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5575297 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5575298 but you know suddenly magically youve got the same guy who wrote
5575299 so i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
5575300 this explains why his tax plan gives hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax breaks to people making more than 2 5 million i guess theyre middle class
5575301 theyve been doing this every election they did it to john kerry they did it to gore they tried to do it to clinton they tried they did it to dukakis thats what they do thats their politics they dont know how to govern but they know how to run a negative campaign
5575302 its not going to work this time its not going to work because theres too much at stake and you know theres too much at stake
5575303 were going to have to hit back and were going to have to fight hard and were going to have to work hard
5575304 looking at hindsight obviously we would do things differently today
5575305 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps and those are the lessons learned it was over the last few years that we were able to incorporate all of the lessons learned that we have throughout this investigation
5575306 his only response was that he wanted to hang out there which was not a very compelling reason
5575307 they had stiff alibis or they were not in a position to take the material for purposes of this kind
5575308 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool it has always used when it wants to deliver a message thats its military power
5575309 today in accordance with the decision of the president of the russian federation the disengagement of troops from the areas temporarily held by the units of the russian armed forces has begun
5575310 increased subversive and terrorist activities against russian troops and south ossetian civilians were recorded
5575311 they have never been stopped and are on the increase now
5575312 the situation in the russian peacekeepers responsibility zones is under their full control providing favorable conditions for the disengagement of the troops to the designated areas
5575313 we are fully aware that the georgian side is capable of carrying out provocations toward our troops and civilians at any moment
5575314 if somebody thinks that he can with impunity murder our citizens murder our soldiers and officers who are peacekeepers we will never allow this
5575315 all those who try to do something like that will get a crushing response
5575316 we have all possibilities for this economic political and military
5575317 now it is essentially important to restore order and discipline in the republic
5575318 europe will be divided again the lines are different pushed farther east but the division is the same and dangerous
5575319 you cannot conduct foreign policy based on fear of russia weve been through this before ukraine knows it the baltic republics know it
5575320 i dont think russia is an immediate threat to us in the military sense but they are a nasty neighbor
5575321 an alliance with the united states is a long term investment
5575322 poland by deploying the interceptors is exposing itself to a strike 100
5575323 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
5575324 i am not afraid of an invasion and i hate the russians
5575325 that empire is very aggressive but we count on the word of the united states we will be safe because the u s supports us
5575326 only the u s can protect us not europe and so there is no danger for poland
5575327 one battery of patriots will provide no security for warsaw there are lots of threats and not enough privileges
5575328 beginning to walk but by no means were they running
5575329 if that was a u s brigade it would not have gone into combat
5575330 from what ive heard a lot of the 4th brigade was hit pretty hard
5575331 some of the soldiers seemed really grateful for the things we taught them
5575332 come from the hills of georgia and some of them sign for their paycheck with an x
5575333 overall goal is to bring georgia up to nato standards
5575334 i know specifically that bravo company im sure and i hope from what i did for them that theyre better off than they would have been if this happened four weeks ago
5575335 it was not an absolutely decisive factor whether georgians were trained by americans or not
5575336 what happened was due to the political decision of georgian authorities and not the performance on the ground
5575337 im not saying that were suffering here with the one million thread count sheets or checking out the local females at the pool
5575338 but if our job now is to sit here and put down roots in the couch id rather do it at home
5575339 this is no time for individual bravado but for seriousness of thought
5575340 having reviewed the situation and having consulted my legal advisers and political supporters and on their advice for the interest of the nation i have decided to resign
5575341 my future is in the hands of the people let them be the judges and let them do justice
5575342 sadly some elements have politicized the economy and the war on terror
5575343 its better to have a dinner with the devil that you know than to have a dinner with the angel that you dont know
5575344 we want to work with you on the problem of terrorism but we want you to stop bombing our villages
5575345 airstrikes that kill civilians is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism

5575372 the village has a long history of hunting down its perpetrators

5575382 of divine grace toward us confirmed by an outward sign with mutual attestation of our piety toward him
5575383 is it truly for me does it really reach me
5575384 the signs are bread and wine which represent for us the invisible food that we receive from the flesh and blood of christ
5575385 christ is the only food of our soul and therefore our heavenly father invites us to christ that refreshed by partaking of him we may repeatedly gather strength until we shall have reached heavenly immortality
5575386 for as the eternal word of god is the fountain of life so his flesh is the channel to pour out to us the life which resides intrinsically in his divinity for in his flesh was accomplished mans redemption in it a sacrifice was offered to atone for sin and obedience yielded to god to reconcile him to us it was also filled with the sanctification of the holy spirit finally having overcome death he was received into the heavenly glory
5575387 my body is still given for you by faith you may commune with me and my body and all of its saving benefits
5575388 christ then is absent from us in respect of his body but dwelling in us by his spirit he raises us to heaven to himself transfusing into us the vivifying vigor of his flesh just as the rays of the sun invigorate us by his vital warmth
5575389 because we are unable to fly high enough to draw near to god he has ordained sacraments for us like ladders
5575390 if a man wishes to leap on high he will break his neck in the attempt but if he has steps he will be able to proceed with confidence so also if we are to reach our god we must use the means which he has instituted since he knows what is suitable for us god has then given us this wonderful support and encouragement and strength in our weakness
5575391 the lord recalls the great bounty of his goodness to our memory and stirs us up to acknowledge it and at the same time he admonishes us not be ungrateful for such lavish liberality but rather to proclaim it with fitting praises and to celebrate the lords supper by giving thanks

5575393 as to devote ourselves wholly to his obedience and honor him in everything

5575436 we let it be known with the dodgers that was the one ballclub he had interest in going to that any deal we were going to do was going to be the best baseball deal we could do and it wasnt going to be a financial deal to try to move dollars we just werent happy with the prospect we would be getting back and we chose to hold onto him
5575437 but it would be the biggest mistake of his life if he goes on the mound hoping to show the rangers something thats high school stuff
5575438 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5575439 algunos llaman antes de ir a una fiesta porque saben que van a tomar otros se comunican cuando est n enteramente borrachos y tambi n est n aquellos que tienen un nivel de alcohol en sangre que se encuentra dentro de los par metros permitidos
5575440 la idea no es que no tomen sino que si toman no manejen a veces el chiste en las fiestas es ver qui n toma m s y mientras los accidentes van en aumento en el pa s
5575441 en los accidentes de tr nsito en personas menores de 35 a os el alcohol suele ser un elemento clave
5575442 el 47 por ciento de los argentinos no tiene idea de cu l es el l mite del alcohol al que est n autorizados a tomar o cuanto representa en el test de alcoholemia
5575443 hay personas que no quieren que se note que alguien los lleva otros incluso no toleran que el ch fer los traslade a una velocidad moderada
5575444 de a poco a la gente le va cambiando el chip acerca de que si tom no tiene que manejar
5575445 estoy bien mi ltimo partido fue hace nueve d as con la filial de jaguares

5575450 la feria de la plata nos permite contactarnos directamente con el publico adem s esta muy bueno que la organizaci n le de importancia a los vinos y no se monten stand muy grandes que lo nico que hacen es darle frialdad al evento
5575451 esto es posible gracias a un gran esfuerzo organizacional que permite que a o a a o el evento siga creciendo y cautivando a m s participantes
5575452 es un evento que la ciudad estaba necesitando ya que para disfrutar de una feria de estas caracter sticas hay que trasladarse s o s a la ciudad de buenos aires
5575453 es un evento muy bien armado que nos da la posibilidad de encontrar una nueva plaza para exhibir todo el trabajo que se realiza en las bodegas y que tiene como fruto final a nuestros vinos
5575454 la organizaci n es muy buena yo no hab a estado en ediciones anteriores pero me hab an comentado que el publico de la plata era muy conocedor de los vinos y gracias a que este a o puede venir lo comprob espero volver
5575455 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5575456 i was so mad and i i just remember i was i was just shaking
5575457 because many see them as rough investment forecasts or as prospectuses for local companies as a result there is a big scramble to get this info and buy into local online casinos businesses right away before market prices exceed a reasonable investment amount
5575458 ive always wanted to start my own online casinos company through the internet
5575459 and now i can because of new government grants for internet start ups
5575460 but i must say it is easy creating a new corporate community and economic boom that will benefit those around us greatly many times start up companies tend to become burdens to the general public beacuse they fold or otherwise go under but companies like mine mitigate that risk and show profits right away this means less foreclosures and higher credit limits for businesspeople like me who are looking to the future of the online casinos industry
5575461 we got start up capital from family friends and a few bank loans
5575462 and then slowly paid each respective party off one at a time this took about five years to do but all debts were satisfied with full repayment and some extra for interest
5575463 i thought id be answering phone calls from creditors and writing order forms out by hand now that we see the potential of the online casinos consumer market weve immediately hired new staff to meet the high demands of this market
5575464 youll need lots of capital talent luck and financial discipline to see your project through
5575465 haha da hadde vi nok f tt v re alene ja

5575474 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5575475 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5575476 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5575477 great site great service i started submitting my press releases through mediasyndicate com over four years ago and never looked back the site has always delivered reliable and consistent results for my clients

5575484 we are delighted to have helped bis in future proofing their network and providing them with the quality fibre they required within the given short time frame
5575485 nevada is at the epicenter in the debate of how america should generate and use energy in the future nevada has abundant clean energy sources such as solar wind geothermal and efficiency technologies that could be developed to meet its future energy needs
5575486 i was so scared i had to get the jitters out
5575487 that was a humongous crowd ive never seen a crowd this big
5575488 it was just put it all down and see what happens get to the final jump
5575489 the resignation will bring an end to confrontations thus easing the political uncertainty hanging over the market
5575490 we feel it is only the labour ministry in the state that can intervene and settle the issue because even after making an additional capital investment of rs 150 million three months ago production has not gone up
5575491 to enable us to tide over the current high natural rubber crude crude based raw material transportation and energy costs despite negotiations with the unions for the past few months there has been no solution and the unions have taken a negative and non cooperative attitude to any production increases despite the offer of production linked monetary benefits and incentives
5575492 the jv between m amp m and yancheng tractor will further combine indian entrepreneurial and managerial skills with chinese competitiveness and efficiency
5575493 i am sure this formidable combination will contribute substantially towards realising our ambition to be the leading tractor manufacturer in the global market
5575494 operational excellence international sales and distribution network and research and development capabilities of mahindra
5575495 we will have a product range going up to 125 horsepower we will also have a large manufacturing base which will be used to not only produce for the domestic market but also for low cost manufacture for exports
5575496 it is envisaged that customers will ultimately benefit from cost effective and innovative internet telephony service
5575497 these recommendations will put indian telecom sector in tune with global trends the grey market tendencies shall be curtailed
5575498 lalu ji promised me thrice that the road would be made i stood for hours before his gate to ask what happened to his promises but was rarely allowed to meet him
5575499 it was exactly a year ago that nitish kumar promised he would fulfil manjhis dream by constructing a metalled road through the mountain but so far there has been no response from government it appears that it was a mere promise
5575500 nitish kumar had announced in last august plans to build a three km metalled road from gahlaur to amethi but the project has remained only on paper similarly he announced to build a health centre and a community hall in manjhis memory but work is yet to start
5575501 please insult me and my kids then see if ill slap you
5575502 mmm hmm that girl is rough you can tell cant you
5575503 have you been tested for that rare syndrome in which a person with below average intelligence loses the ability to control her impulses therefore spewing each and every foolish thought that enters into her smaller than average cerebral cortex
5575504 i wish more of our guys would play like that up here
5575505 its not their custom to play like that in china hey thats the way we play it in america i like seeing it the old thing you hear about nice guys they finish last
5575506 im sure it was frustrating for him to see all the other young guys called up to the big leagues i hope he understands why
5575507 probably the most positive thing is to watch all those young guys get called up and not let it affect his state of mind
5575508 if youre not going to be called up to the big leagues its nice to have the olympic experience
5575509 its pretty nerve racking when a guy is coming at you 100 mph
5575510 fortunately i was able to push him out of bounds the second time he gave me a nice stiff arm
5575511 its my first time coming back here and playing in front of hometown fans and my family
5575512 that gets you going a little bit im excited and nervous
5575513 i came to a lot of games here as a kid
5575514 when they won the world series in 1987 and 1991 i remember standing on the corner waving my homer hanky
5575515 its a great thing especially with the stretch were in with no days off
5575516 it will be really nice we never get sundays off
5575517 i dont want to mess with things right now i think its best that we keep our focus on the bears its important for a lot of guys to play well in this game
5575518 i dont want to throw anything off we seem to be making progress with our entire offense so i want to keep that going
5575519 its pretty bad when j t osullivan is outdoing you
5575520 just keep playing well and hes going a good job
5575521 has certainly give me no reason to take him out there right now
5575522 we let it be known with the dodgers that was the one ballclub he had interest in going to that any deal we were going to do was going to be the best baseball deal we could do and it wasnt going to be a financial deal to try to move dollars we just werent happy with the prospect we would be getting back and we chose to hold onto him
5575523 well work on situations hitting making sure our tackling is where it should be
5575524 basically we want to execute and give everybody a chance to get the feel for playing in the stadium
5575525 he was going to be ready to play on either side of the ball

5575537 the wellingtons were basically one of the founding families of waltham
5575538 the thinking is that the wellington house could be sort of a head house for some type of passive recreation area
5575539 weve had a lot of inventory weve had a lot of curriculum and materials and supplies that have been delivered throughout the summer
5575540 ive been meeting with new teachers practicing using the new pa system and i sat down with principal alice shull and talked about how were going to do divide up the administrative responsibilities through out the year
5575541 since he was hired hes been working with me from morning until night he hit the ground running
5575542 hes willing to do everything and anything that needs to be done to open up a new school and get ready for the start of a new school year
5575543 essentially with each administrative task thats being done well sit down talk it through and decide who is responsible for what
5575544 already accomplished a lot it the short time hes been here
5575545 it is something that my colleagues my parents and principals ive worked for suggested i consider and think about
5575546 secondly its sort of a natural compulsion to want to advance after teaching a little more than a decade thinking about the long term and advancement and taking on a new challenge
5575547 my 10 years of experience in the classroom puts me in the position to talk to teachers if they have questions about issues of learning whether its classroom management or whether its a question about massachusetts curriculum framework
5575548 its a gorgeous setting in a nice waltham neighborhood with a nice park on the other side of the building
5575549 i think for all of the students and staff its an uplifting and beautiful place to learn and teach
5575550 one good thing about it is that alice is a great person to work with and to work for thats one big plus
5575551 waltham also has a reputation of being a good community it made the top 100 list of small cities in the u s to live in according to money magazine thats encouraging fortunately ive discovered as i met the staff its a very friendly staff that seems very excited about the upcoming year
5575552 we do the whole play with a ladder and a bench
5575553 its a production thats really simple but it really lets us focus on the characters and really lets us focus on the words and the beautiful poetry of the play
5575554 we decided the best way to get people to see shakespeare was to put it on for free
5575555 it kind of has an informal feel to it theres no real fancy costumes or sets but theres real actors getting outside and doing a real simple play its really an experience of coming to the open grounds of gore place and watching actors get up in an open air and open space
5575556 it suggests the nature of what our collaborative is like
5575557 we move around to different locations instead of having a home base
5575558 themes of separation and of unity and some of the difficulties of people finding common ground and getting over their differences
5575559 we thought it would be something that a lot of people would want to come and check out
5575560 we were well received in somerville and were looking forward to this week in waltham
5575561 gore place was generous in allowing us to put on our play for free
5575562 its a very different experience here we just have kind of a smaller and more intimate show
5575563 i didnt do the politically expedient thing i did the right thing
5575564 it is critical that we vet them with the most scrutiny that we can bring to bear
5575565 is that going to be allowed is that going to be cut out
5575566 ive never heard anyone come up with a better way than they way its being done now
5575567 it might not be a perfect system but i dont know one i would trade it for
5575568 i hope i can avoid surgery but the way it is right now its pretty bad pretty sore and i cant play
5575569 if its surgery then im out eight weeks and im done for the season but until the doctor tells me im going to hope for the best
5575570 i pretty much knew that this was going to be the case when i left here thursday night
5575571 it didnt feel good and that was different from my rehab starts
5575572 i personally think hes the best coach in the history of the league
5575573 it was the business side of it i really didnt want to do it because i love football and running around
5575574 it was really no big deal it gave me extended time to further prepare myself for the season
5575575 but he was competing and fighting hell probably be a little sore tomorrow but hes in good shape
5575576 the preseason is important but i think the idea is to be ready for when the regular season kicks off
5575577 im doing good doing good just wishing i could have been out there last night
5575578 ill try to get treatment this week im feeling better every day
5575579 genuine risk was an amazing horse with tremendous heart that lived a life befitting a champion
5575580 we are truly blessed that she was a part of our life and we are deeply saddened by her passing
5575581 it is difficult to still play a lot of matches
5575582 i want to recover for the u s open unfortunately i have to pull out of this tournament
5575583 football brings great joy to the country but nothing could ever compare to playing in the world cup
5575584 we have a great opportunity and everyone is supporting us
5575585 it is crucial we get a good result we have seen what the world cup has meant to other countries and we want to experience it as well
5575586 because we were very close last time everyone is hopeful that our fortunes will change
5575587 we have a combination of experienced players and young players and those young players have not had to suffer through the past everyone is determined
5575588 the standard of the guatemalan league is below that of international level
5575589 and when you play for the national team you notice the difference
5575590 forgive me my sins and help me guard against pride and despair give me the wisdom to do what is right and just and make me an instrument of your will
5575591 a merica loves israel and the jewish people and will stand by the jewish people he said standing at the wall the us he added will continue to look out for israels security need and is israels true friend
5575592 reduction in gulf tensions will result in a drop in oil prices which would help certain folks get elected to the white house
5575593 guy has turned his back on kabbalah once and for all
5575594 he has gone hot and cold on the religion in the past but now hes given up on it altogether
5575595 he just flows theres no resistance at all sometimes i feel that im fighting to run but with him theres no fight
5575596 it just comes naturally when he runs with us the whole group gets to a new level
5575597 after 65 years i have found the sister who i love
5575598 his pastorate here had an impact so tremendous it defies appraisal
5575599 oh sure its easy to say that its not your project with all these errors and mistakes in it youre a professional
5575600 hi were chip n dale dancers and we just moved into the neighborhood
5575601 origin has rejected bg groups offer but has comprehensively failed to justify its position
5575602 completely inadequate responses to an all cash offer which provides a 72 per cent premium

5575609 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
5575610 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese
5575611 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
5575612 i think thats an event i can do well in
5575613 before you go into the studio everyone hangs out in a staging area for about an hour you have plenty of time to start something i would recommend having something fun and very l a to do after the show to offer the girls to go to then get into drinks
5575614 most of the women are foreigners and or a little white trashy so they are probably very easy all of them are for sure looking for something to do after the show
5575615 it was inventive on his part ill give him that
5575616 we hadden het niet beter kunnen doen dan dat we tot nu toe hebben gedaan
5575617 dit was stap n ik heb geen moment getwijfeld over het bereiken van de halve finales
5575618 het is heel simpel om een opdracht mee te geven maar het ook daadwerkelijk uitvoeren is iets moeilijker
5575619 maar dat komt ook doordat je door die ochtendwedstrijd uit je ritme wordt gehaald
5575620 in het laatste deel hebben we het baltempo omhoog gedaan en toen ging het beter

5575627 were very encouraged with how weve been able to drive generic utilization for our members and consumers because we know that the use of generic medications is the most effective way to keep prescription drug spending manageable
5575628 a lack of blockbuster drugs in the pharmaceutical development pipeline along with increasing acceptance of generic drugs by consumers suggests that the low increase we saw during 2007 will be sustained for some time to come
5575629 we are committed to ethical arrangements and ensuring that interactions between industry and health care providers enhance the publics health and foster public confidence unfortunately this legislation would impede important interactions with providers and could drive this critical research and development out of state
5575630 unlike other segments of the health care sector medical technology is often developed and refined based on input from physicians who have direct and constant feedback from their patients training by manufacturers to providers is often critical to the safe use of complex technology
5575631 americas medical device manufacturers believe that patients should have full confidence that the only factor influencing a physicians decision making is the best interests of the patient
5575632 in addition advameds code of ethics adopted in 2003 is tailored to the unique interactions among the medical device industry and health care professionals to preserve ethical collaborations that fuel advances in medical technology and ensure patient access to the most advanced technologies
5575633 the decision to suspend enrollment in this clinical trial is based solely on the results reported in a recently published study comparing laser treatment and intravitreal injections of ta
5575634 we believe the data from the phase i and phase iib clinical trials generated to date provide support for the tolerability profile of i vation ta and more generally that of the i vation sustained delivery platform
5575635 the actions announced today are part of long term global geographic expansion strategy
5575636 investing in the asia pacific region and especially china represents another step in our journey to transform schering plough into a global high performance health care company with a long term presence in china schering plough now takes a significant step forward in its strategic development to further build growth and strength in this important market
5575637 our long standing relationships with our former joint venture partners shanghai pharmaceutical industry co ltd and shanghai pharmaceutical group co ltd have been an integral part of the successful establishment of schering plough in china
5575638 we have built a solid foundation in the chinese market which continues to offer great potential todays news demonstrates our commitment to partner with our customers and to further contribute to the health care needs of chinese patients

5575651 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself

5575653 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
5575654 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated

5575660 let me ask it this way a lot of times candidates are accused of flip flopping but actually sometimes flip flopping is smart because you have decided a better position based on knowledge that you didnt have whats the most significant position you held ten years ago that you no longer hold today that you flipped on you changed on because you actually see it differently
5575661 whats the most significant let me ask it this way whats the most gut wrenching decision youve ever had to make and how did you process that come to that decision
5575662 somebody is not going to like them because we are all different kinds of worldviews in america but people want to know what your worldview is so as we go through it these mindfields lets kind of tic them off the mindfields of america the first one is christianty now youve made no doubt about your faith in jesus christ what does that mean to you what does it mean to you to trust in christ and what does it mean on a daily basis i mean what does that really look like

5575665 does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it
5575666 the obama campaign has started this meme to distract us from obamas bad performance
5575667 its difficult to win in a hostile environment john mccain was set up to take the day and he did bravo johnny
5575668 wow a lot of people auditioned for assassins and brian was cast as hinkley im sure the director saw who auditioned and he was the one who fit his mindset the best
5575669 the discussion about returns this past week however has meant something different apparently theres a very vocal group of readers trying to incite a riot of consumer returns of stephenie meyers just released breaking dawn despite its excellent sales nielsen bookscan reports that the much ballyhooed ya novel which pubbed at midnight on friday august 1 sold 834 000 copies in one day some consumers are so disappointed with the finale of the series that they feel they deserve their money back
5575670 and the disappointment is not passive its downright activist to judge from a customer discussion blog on amazon
5575671 it would send a strong message to little brown and stephenie meyer
5575672 ya know the babys head is still too high to suction and you will be pushing for quite some time later he told me about 2 hours he thought and baby isnt tolerating the pushing so we do need to go ahead with a c section

5575677 we were listening to the piece about cindy mccain on npr all things considered and it just struck us very hard
5575678 im an only child my father was a cowboy and he really loved me very much but i think he wanted a son occasionally
5575679 im angry it makes me feel like a nonperson kind of
5575680 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
5575681 what she found in town on the day of or the day before or the day after his funeral was that the credit card didnt work anymore
5575682 the fact that weve never been recognized and then cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true recently again and again its just very very hurtful
5575683 arachnophobia you think its just a movie but its real
5575684 i detest them im afraid of them i wont go outside at night
5575685 hopefully she finds out what they are and if theyre not poisonous im not going to be so freaked out
5575686 the spiders probably came in on the wind when they were tiny
5575687 in order for a spider to be hit youd have to directly spray it and if youre that close you could actually hit it with a can and kill it

5575703 i always like to see how people are dreaming when you stop dreaming you stop living
5575704 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
5575705 the response rate is 10 and we do not calculate refusal rates for zogby interactive polls
5575706 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
5575707 as far as i know we dont publish response and refusal rates we conducted the poll for the associated press youd have to ask them about releasing the response and refusal rates
5575708 we dont have them here from ipsos it takes a little while for them to get those to us i can ask them it shouldnt take too long but normally it takes a few days theyre not secret or anything
5575709 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
5575710 the response rate for the poll was 31 over a three day field period because of the unique method of collecting data for this poll the response rate is not comparable to those of telephone based polls
5575711 as we collect data using our online panel there really is not a comparable metric to the refusal rates that telephone polls have
5575712 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
5575713 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
5575714 the figures come as no surprise considering the pressure that todays women are under just to make themselves look good

5575720 we are very excited to support the growth of this enabling technology by bringing together some of the industrys leading researchers and practitioners to stimulate discussion on the real world manufacturing and reliability challenges of tsvs
5575721 our goals are to identify key challenges so that 3d ic products can be introduced on schedule with the expected cost performance and reliability
5575722 nansulate has been specified into the main cooling and heating system for this design nansulate added to the mattress cover system was found to reduce cooling temperature at a rate of 1 8 degrees per minute as compared to the foam insulation alone which reduced temperature at a rate of 1 1 degrees per minute all tests were performed under identical conditions cooling one gallon of fluid by speeding up the cooling process substantial energy savings were achieved in addition nansulate prevented sweating during the cooling process and also prevents growth of unwanted substances on the surface of the system
5575723 the same carefully researched cooling and heating system specifying nansulate will be incorporated into a new machine to form x ray invisible casts with perfectly even pressure over the entire area of a broken limb the casts can be worn while swimming or bathing and re formed again with perfectly even pressure when swelling reduces due to nansulate the time to form a perfectly even pressure cast will be approximately three minutes additionally nansulate is being specified in the heating and cooling system for a unique portable machine to heat and or cool with adjustable massage any area of the body for sports medicine and general physiotherapy needs this machine will free up the doctor or technician to perform other tasks the portability of the battery operated machine is due in large part to the energy savings realized with nansulate insulating coatings
5575724 the incorporation of our nansulate coating into these medical devices represents a brand new market segment opportunity edward moore design is an expert in their field and we look forward to our technology offering unique benefits to their company for this medical equipment and other designs energy savings is something that is important to every industry and we are pleased to offer a solution that can be used in a variety of diverse applications

5575729 the bank records seized demonstrate that the world tamil movement has developed an elaborate machine like entity that moves throughout the greater toronto area collecting funds with extreme proficiency
5575730 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
5575731 mahindra has made it clear that the company is not interested in buying hummer the suv brand of the us automaker general motors
5575732 there has been a lot of speculation i am saying categorically that we are not pursuing hummer at the auto expo we have showcased our strength as green warriors and we dont want to tarnish our image
5575733 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5575734 we the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
5575735 people think you are sometimes manic depressive i think im going to have to ask you to leave the company
5575736 the idea which dell plans to unveil as early as september is to create a broad standard more open than apples that will give people greater choice in how they buy and consume music movies and podcasts
5575737 customers want access to content from a broad variety of sources how when and where they choose
5575738 the software handles behind the scenes translations so that content can be
5575739 who would have thought last year that me and t boone pickens would be in the same boat pulling the same oar the same way
5575740 when you go to the gas pump you dont check whether you are a democrat or republican
5575741 now dependent on foreign nations for 70 percent of its oil the u s is exporting 700 billion annually more than four times the cost of the iraq war
5575742 there are people standing by with billions ready to invest in the future sun wind geothermal biomass
5575743 we cant drill our way of this situation but we will do everything we can to produce more domestic energy just two years ago i pushed for 8 3 million acres of drill sites in the gulf of mexico now that is done
5575744 any credible domestic energy policy must reduce our dependence on foreign oil by at least 30 percent in the next 10 years
5575745 he understands the issues and is interested and excited by the work we are doing to educate and involve the people
5575746 importing 70 percent of our oil now thats an issue of security its going to take us 10 years to reduce our dependency by 30 percent
5575747 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
5575748 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
5575749 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
5575750 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5575751 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5575752 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5575753 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5575754 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5575755 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5575756 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5575757 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5575758 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5575759 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5575760 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5575761 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5575762 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5575763 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5575764 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5575765 serious problem with competition if google and yahoo are allowed to proceed
5575766 i kind of fought my way on there and i thought theres no time like the present
5575767 i tried to make it a battle of pure willpower i gave it everything i had
5575768 i tried hard i tried really hard for a moment there i thought i had it
5575769 to be able to fight my way back to the podium that was hard that was so hard
5575770 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
5575771 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
5575772 evidently we didnt do enough work in the last 10 days
5575773 like i told them its my fault for trying to save them a little bit and not beat them up on the practice field so we came down here and got beat up in the game
5575774 as soon as we got back to practice amani showed me
5575775 hes the best in the business at that he knows just how to stay in even if he has to fall doing it
5575776 a hat trick in a quarter is not a bad night
5575777 as you saw we didnt play very good they outcoached us they outplayed us we were in it for a second
5575778 then we got too many penalties and penalties changed field position the first quarter basically was the game it was unbelievable
5575779 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5575780 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5575781 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5575782 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5575783 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5575784 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5575785 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5575786 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5575787 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5575788 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5575789 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5575790 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5575791 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5575792 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5575793 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5575794 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
5575795 10 6 gw the generation capacity of the six plants x 7884 hours of generation per year assuming 90 operational 83 57 twh y 83 57 twh y x 0 65 54 mt co2 y
5575796 without the required demonstrated competencies in the performance of the procedure
5575797 ensuring all californians receive quality patient care is our top priority
5575798 however we disagree with the states findings and we are appealing the citations
5575799 the hospital reviewed the incidents thoroughly then we reported them to the state
5575800 the state also came in at some point and reviewed these incidents they too were not able to find a correlation between the events and the adverse patient outcome
5575801 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
5575802 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
5575803 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
5575804 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5575805 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5575806 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5575807 if we have free will so do subatomic particles mathematicians claim
5575808 we let it be known with the dodgers that was the one ballclub he had interest in going to that any deal we were going to do was going to be the best baseball deal we could do and it wasnt going to be a financial deal to try to move dollars we just werent happy with the prospect we would be getting back and we chose to hold onto him
5575809 wanted to see where i was at and not slow down too much
5575810 i was pretty mad but had to get over it
5575811 it was unfortunate but hey you never know what happens nowadays
5575812 i still have the scars but im happy im thankful
5575813 its a shame a final should be with the best ones
5575814 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5575815 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5575816 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5575817 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5575818 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5575819 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5575820 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5575821 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
5575822 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5575823 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5575824 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5575825 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5575826 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5575827 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5575828 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5575829 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
5575830 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5575831 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5575832 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5575833 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5575834 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5575835 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5575836 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5575837 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5575838 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5575839 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5575840 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5575841 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5575842 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5575843 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
5575844 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
5575845 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
5575846 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
5575847 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
5575848 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
5575849 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
5575850 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
5575851 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
5575852 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
5575853 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
5575854 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5575855 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5575856 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5575857 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5575858 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5575859 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5575860 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5575861 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5575862 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5575863 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5575864 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5575865 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5575866 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5575867 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5575868 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5575869 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5575870 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5575871 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5575872 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5575873 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion

5575876 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5575877 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5575878 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5575879 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5575880 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5575881 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5575882 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5575883 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5575884 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5575885 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5575886 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5575887 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
5575888 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5575889 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5575890 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5575891 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5575892 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5575893 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet

5575897 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here

5575900 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5575901 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5575902 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5575903 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5575904 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5575905 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5575906 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5575907 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5575908 just so you all know we did set a record
5575909 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5575910 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5575911 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5575912 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5575913 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
5575914 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
5575915 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
5575916 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
5575917 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5575918 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5575919 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5575920 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5575921 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5575922 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5575923 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5575924 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5575925 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5575926 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5575927 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5575928 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5575929 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5575930 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5575931 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5575932 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5575933 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5575934 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5575935 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5575936 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
5575937 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
5575938 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
5575939 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5575940 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5575941 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5575942 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of the ceasefire and should be removed immediately
5575943 drivers who kill through carelessness will no longer be able to walk away from court with just a fine
5575944 a moments distraction can make the difference between life and death
5575945 reading or composing text messages over a period of time
5575946 allowing distractions to affect your standard of driving is not acceptable and will now be more appropriately punished under the law
5575947 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5575948 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5575949 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against the rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5575950 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5575951 they used them as human shields the rebels killed them on their way out they were killed as if they were chickens that is the report given to us by the civilians
5575952 i condemn the dastardly attack and the violence sowed by the milf early this morning in some towns of lanao del norte
5575953 we will crush any attempt to disturb peace and development in mindanao
5575954 we have driven away the rebels we are going after them
5575955 an excellent vantage point for the recent collapse of the multilateral trade negotiations
5575956 madden is the absolute most consistent video game in the industry
5575957 theres not even the slightest fear this title will flop
5575958 men line up at midnight to buy the game then take the day off work to play it
5575959 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5575960 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5575961 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5575962 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5575963 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5575964 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5575965 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5575966 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5575967 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5575968 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5575969 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5575970 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5575971 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5575972 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5575973 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5575974 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now

5575978 when threatening situations turn into reality in conflict regions we need to take an in depth look at what really happened what forces were used and how they were deployed
5575979 we are in a completely different situation than sweden which is now considering change the swedes havent built up their defence forces in many years
5575980 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
5575981 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
5575982 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5575983 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5575984 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5575985 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5575986 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5575987 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that

5575991 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
5575992 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5575993 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5575994 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5575995 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming

5576001 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5576002 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5576003 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5576004 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5576005 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5576006 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5576007 australian authorities repeatedly say there is no specific threat of terrorism against the olympic games beginning september in sydney but sources in the security teams said that a judgment was made that any terrorist threat was likely to come from the osama bin laden funded groups osama bin laden was publicly acknowledged as a serious concern on june 4th when australian and international intelligence agencies reported they were alarmed at the emergence throughout south and south east asia of terrorist groups linked to osama bin laden the announcement coincided with separate media report in the australian newspaper sunday age that bin laden associates were suspected of buying biological weapons from an undisclosed former soviet state intelligence sources had told reporters bin laden had purchase of deadly anthrax and plague viruses from arms dealers in kazakhstan
5576008 olympic security officials have already dealt with a number of threats leading up to the sydney 2000 games one of the more serious came to head on may 22nd when a 28 year old man in sydney was arrested in possession of explosives after making numerous threats to olympic organizers authorities said the man changed his name to his idol martin bormann one of adolf hitlers henchmen and was described as a racist olympic investigation strike force officials making the arrest also seized a number of racist documents at his home hydrochloric acid chlorine gasoline and fertilizer all major ingredients for making explosives were found in a bunker below his sydney home
5576009 groups such as the anti olympic alliance protest 2000 and people ingeniously subverting the sydney olympic farce have been documenting the questionable business deals environmental policy shortfalls global selling of indigenous aboriginal culture and last minute legislation remember the street crackdown provisions of the homebush bay area act branded un australian during melbournes s11 protests despite a long national history of subversive rebels cat lyst sydney indymedia and sydney alternative media center activists have documented peaceful and non violent anti olympics protests that would otherwise have ended up on the cutting room floor dissent is swelling in australia but you wouldnt hear about it from cnn discover what nbc doesnt want you to know about and salon com correspondents havent uncovered yet the dream is fast turning into an olympics nightmare
5576010 the raft of legislation which has been introduced during the lead up to the sydney 2000 olympics achieves four things it significantly infringes basic democratic rights of public protest and freedom of movement and assembly it dramatically increases the power of police and security guards in many of the most important public places in sydney it introduces wide ranging public order offences without safeguards or accountability against the abuse of power and it has a legislative life span well beyond the period in which the olympics and paralympics are scheduled to take place
5576011 het verkeer maakt elk jaar duizend doden en bijna 60 000 gewonden mensen moeten begrijpen dat het niet onmogelijk is om dat aantal naar beneden te krijgen want we kennen de oorzaken van die ongevallen snelheid alcohol drugs geen gordel
5576012 ik ga er bij de gewesten op aandringen dat ze de automatische snelheidscontroles verhogen
5576013 vooral in walloni moeten er meer flitspalen komen al moeten we wel verstandiger omspringen met de snelheidsbeperking er staan te veel borden aan de kant van de weg
5576014 met elektronische borden moet je de snelheid omlaag halen op de gevoelige punten net na de schooluren of bij het begin van een toneelvoorstelling op de snelwegen moeten we overwegen om in slechte weersomstandigheden 110 km per uur te verplichten
5576015 er is een mentaliteitswijziging nodig maar dat alleen is niet genoeg ik wil het niet zoeken in het verhogen van de boetes de pakkans moet omhoog het moet ons doel zijn dat elk jaar n op de tien automobilisten eens gecontroleerd is onder meer op het dragen van de gordel of alcohol en druggebruik

5576019 when she expressed a desire to help people in rural maharashtra we decided to encourage her
5576020 she always had an inclination toward social service and we decided to cultivate it
5576021 the drive began in july and by the end of the month a total of 2600 was collected this money was sufficient to dig a bore well as well as fit an electric pump
5576022 i want to build rural maharashtra i want medical attention to be available to everyone and make physicians available in every village in rural maharashtra
5576023 een gemiddelde auto zoals een opel astra of een volkswagen golf kost elk jaar 4 974 euro
5576024 wanneer een gezin met twee kinderen ouder dan twaalf min of meer dezelfde verplaatsingen met het openbaar vervoer wil doen is het meer dan 10 000 euro per jaar kwijt
5576025 ons doelpubliek is het woon werkverkeer en het woon schoolverkeer voor die mensen hebben we w l interessante tarieven de gemiddelde prijs voor een gezin ligt hier tussen de 1 200 en de 1 300 euro per jaar

5576027 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5576028 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5576029 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word

5576032 obviously theyve had this in the planning stage for some time
5576033 i feel comfortable saying that we can add at least five indicators next spring
5576034 these goals should be able to be carried over from year to year regardless of administration and building changes
5576035 they may need tweaked but the framework is established for now and the future
5576036 the school takes away less from a 25 fee than the families do

5576042 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5576043 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5576044 todays map shows obama with a projected 275 votes to mccains 250 with 13 up for grabs four years ago kerry 317 bush 202 and 19 tied interesting
5576045 personally i think his decision to hold his acceptance speech in a football stadium filled with left wing celebrities and 70 000 screaming sycophants is a terrible idea it plays right into his growing celebrity messiah problem
5576046 when you really look at the investigators involved and the procedures they followed they were all within what has been defined as appropriate in every medical field
5576047 to block access to this protocol is really hurting the people who need it most
5576048 theres much more influence relative to day to day prescribing
5576049 this attack is causing us to go back to the system we had before with individual doctors who may have individual influence instead of using a standardized protocol
5576050 in our country theres been a switch from taking care of people to focusing on big corporate money
5576051 there need to be restrictions on how these things are done because the victims are our children
5576052 the newer medications have no substantial advantage over the older medication
5576053 they were done on my own time and they followed all the guidelines
5576054 in terms of what ive been involved with i havent seen anybody paid by the industry to promote a product
5576055 not the drug the most recent representative told me about

5576069 the sbc church compensation study is an important resource for churches to use as they seek to determine appropriate salaries for their staff members
5576070 our prayer is that churches will use it both as they seek to hire new staff but also as they retain existing staff to ensure their compensation is competitive with other churches and within their communities

5576081 he got second hand information about the altercation inside but was being protective towards his 20 year old daughter in law
5576082 leaving aside the apparent unprovekedness and the serious injury to the man this is not an offence where he would be a danger to the public at large
5576083 given the gratuitious response of the defendent even given the circumstances he has taken the law into his own hands and hasnt considered the consequences or maybe he did
5576084 even with everything you painted a picture as to what caused the behavior on the defendants part there is stark reality it could happen again
5576085 if im mistaken or have formed a warped view i can be corrected elsewhere
5576086 everyone makes mistakes but the risk is unacceptable it matters not if hes 37 or 57
5576087 that having a child fall asleep in your arms is one of the most peaceful feelings in the world
5576088 when the kids leave the dynamics of couple relationships change however research shows that marital satisfaction can actually increase in this empty nest stage
5576089 one great thing about moving into a new stage in life is that it is an opportunity to redefine ourselves and our relationships
5576090 its important that couples let go of past disappointments and look forward to strengthening the second half of their relationship

5576094 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years

5576100 the physical presence of other christians is a source of incomparable joy and strength to the believer
5576101 the more genuine and the deeper our community becomes the more will everything else between us recede the more clearly and purely will jesus christ and his work become the one and only thing that is vital between us
5576102 dont ever talk badly about their dad allow them to talk well of him
5576103 how the biological mom and dad navigate life for the entire future of their childs life
5576104 is the most critical part of the child having an opportunity to thrive versus just surviving or continuing in the brokenness and woundedness resulting from their parents divorce
5576105 most children of divorce do struggle with loving mom and loving dad and being able to express that in their everyday life
5576106 a lot of times kids act like theyre not listening but theyre hearing everything you say
5576107 intentionally find things in the other parent that you can say are positive point them out to the child give the child permission to love the other parent
5576108 forgiveness gives parents the ability to co parent without all the emotional drama without rehashing the past without hatred
5576109 i didnt want to spend the next 20 years of my life looking back pointing blame asking unanswerable questions
5576110 forgiveness becomes a gift to the parent to their children and to every other relationship in their life
5576111 why take so much energy grocery listing what he did wrong
5576112 just transact the business which is the business of supporting a child
5576113 to get sidelined into personal or marital issues and keep the conversation always and only on the children
5576114 remember that just because someone was not a very good spouse a child still deserves to get to love their parent
5576115 and this not so great spouse is a much loved parent
5576116 there is not a one size fits all answer to every complication in co parenting
5576117 but there are some foundational truths for communicating between parents and the lifelong effects
5576118 its a truism that the olympics is one of the last events that brings everyone to the television set in such magnitude
5576119 has sort of been the anti sports sport for quite a while

5576156 the war within a secret white house history 2006 2008
5576157 there has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the nixon tapes and the pentagon papers
5576158 this is the declassification of what went on in secret behind the scenes
5576159 takes readers deep inside the white house the pentagon the state department the intelligence agencies and the u s military headquarters in iraq
5576160 based on extensive interviews with participants contemporaneous notes and secret documents the book traces the internal debates tensions and critical turning points in the iraq war during an extraordinary two year period
5576161 we are pleased to join with terapeak to offer our customers an alternative service for ebay marketplace research
5576162 we have been working with terapeak as a certified provider for several years and believe they are well suited to provide a research product that meets the needs of our customers
5576163 neale said he was pleased that most of marqui s current employees had agreed
5576164 a canadian based company that has been operating for more than ten years dedicated to providing
5576165 in between the police strike force piccadilly and ourselves we basically made atms too hard a target and not a profitable target to attack
5576166 weve had a number of them attacked and the thieves have abandoned their attack quite quickly once theyve realised theyve been beaten
5576167 when the problem was occurring the clients wanted to have it not too public until they got some of them out in the field and started defeating these ram raiders
5576168 this project will not only bring the pilbaras electricity system into the 21st century but the communities that rely on that system will flourish as a result
5576169 we have a long term vision for the pilbara and this is the cornerstone to fulfilling those plans
5576170 the prospect of an operational electricity market has already resulted in two independent private sector proposals being put to the government for the provision of up to 2 000mw of electricity for 2013
5576171 greater growth with lower greenhouse gas impact will be a major coup for our export focussed industries as they deal with emission caps in the future
5576172 i suggest to you that you and mr sanhueza said to him mr guirguis that if he didnt buy the goods you would not give him any more work
5576173 foleys probably done a little bit more today in our skills session just from a running point of view than what browny did
5576174 browny was still stationary today but its only early in the week so well give both those boys an opportunity to come up later in the week
5576175 id sort of say that nathan foleys ahead of nathan brown at the minute
5576176 their contested footy games improved and their clearance footy games improved immeasurably in the second half of the year which makes them a more dangerous item than what they perhaps were in the first half of the year so we dont take them lightly
5576177 its important for our guys to know they can compete with sides that have been right up there for the entire year so i think that thats really important
5576178 i think also from a direction point of view as much as i can sit there and say that i believe in our younger group of players and i think were very even in a group of players that are coming through
5576179 for them to actually see that themselves probably helps us sell the message to ourselves that weve been trying to portray
5576180 just because we are out of step with other states doesnt mean we are wrong
5576181 it can be very difficult for juries to follow what has happened
5576182 what if a jury cannot reach an 11 1 majority decision the way is now cleared to allow 10 2 or nine to three verdicts
5576183 a majority verdict weakens the whole basis of what a jury is supposed to do reach unanimous agreement on guilt or innocence
5576184 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5576185 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5576186 in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5576187 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5576188 even in retrospect obama would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5576189 theres nobody down there in dire straits because they dont have any food or water right now
5576190 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5576191 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5576192 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5576193 there was no way of hiking back there was no way of getting out
5576194 strengthening is expected tonight and tuesday and fay is forecast to be at or near hurricane strength winds of 119km h as it approaches the southwestern coast of florida
5576195 tornadoes are likely in some areas tonight and tomorrow and maybe even into the next few days
5576196 economic growth has been sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices and weaker growth in exports
5576197 global financial markets remain unstable and there are downside risks to the world economy particularly the us economy
5576198 while growth will likely remain sluggish for the time being it is expected to return gradually onto a moderate growth path as commodity prices level out and overseas economies move out of their deceleration phase
5576199 is expected to be somewhat higher over the coming months but to moderate gradually thereafter thus it is likely that the economy will return onto a sustainable growth path with price stability
5576200 i have another project based on the life of comedian bill hicks which is going from treatment to draft stage with kiwi writer mark staufer
5576201 the australian product information currently contains warnings about the potential for pancreatitis to occur with this medicine
5576202 the tga will now review the new information to determine if strengthening of these warnings is required
5576203 very rare case reports of pancreatitis with complications or with a fatal outcome
5576204 the russian side is gravely violating the conditions provided for by the peace accord signed by the presidents of georgia france and the russian federation
5576205 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5576206 i think you just have those games where you feel like youre hitting the ball well
5576207 at the moment i feel like im striking the ball as good as i have ever have
5576208 stats are irrelevant the biggest thing is if the teams going well then im happy
5576209 its just one of the jobs and its something that i look forward to
5576210 i havent changed a real lot maybe i just had easier shots thats all it was theyve just been closer to the posts
5576211 if you can strike while the iron is hot if you can take advantage of field position and pressure and momentum then the game does have a fair amount of chemistry to it
5576212 no not psychological i dont think it is at all
5576213 i think the tri nations shows how tough it is to win away from home obviously south africa did it in new zealand which was a huge effort
5576214 its just the way this competition is your home games are the ones that you really want to win and you really have to win
5576215 its not something that weve spoken about too much i suppose the history its more just this year
5576216 weve been given our opportunities now weve got two games over here so wed like to win both of them
5576217 whether the springboks won or lost wed still go into the game with a bit of confidence
5576218 weve got a lot of confidence within our group and within the players that weve got here so it doesnt matter which side were playing against or the results that have happened previously
5576219 we know this games going to be a tough game against the springboks were not taking it lightly but within our squad were confident in our own abilities
5576220 weve got two halfbacks with us and theres other players as well with us this time whove played in that position before the likes of matt giteau
5576221 i think in the first instance it probably wouldnt be a surprise to you that well look to experience
5576222 so im giving you an insight there that we dont normally do ive broken protocol there
5576223 experience is valuable but it comes down to how you use that
5576224 what previous experience in these sort of contests gives you is an insight but if you then dont use that to your best advantage then its not much value
5576225 they ran today and reported no ill effects on that so we just have to see how they go see how they respond to that work in particular tomorrow and just push on and take it as it comes
5576226 well consider our selection and that will pertain to the springboks
5576227 well look at what we believe will serve us best we havent made those decisions yet believe it or not so well have those discussions and well settle on a combination
5576228 the reality is you can only live in the moment and you can only deal with the challenges that youre presented with at any given point in time and weve got an opportunity coming this weekend and we are not thinking beyond that
5576229 foles has accepted a position with the waratahs which is great for him gives him some certainty
5576230 hes still contracted with us through til march next year and he could still be with us as yet unless he decides he doesnt want to be thats in the future
5576231 australia is like the south africa of the racist regime
5576232 the conventions are an important part of the presidential election process and hp is pleased to partner with both parties for the conventions in 2008 just as we did in 2000 and 2004

5576235 until the last minute he was in two minds facing a choice between fight and flight
5576236 an idea is to bring awareness because we all know that the plaster of paris which is used for making ganesha idols is extremely harmful for the marine life this year is just the starting but next year we going to take it on a very big scale
5576237 we should be allowed to work freely to collect news and to serve the people it is difficult for us to move freely as the threat sometimes becomes personal we are asking the militant group is to leave us alone
5576238 all employees have come out voluntarily to sit in protest against the demands and threat as far as safety is concerned nobody is safe in manipur
5576239 after their failure in kashmir now huji and all other militant outfits are using the whole northeast as a transit camp and from assam from northeast they are moving towards other parts of the country
5576240 because of these illegal bangladeshis residing over here our small scale business has gone into their hands all those businesses like selling vegetables and fishes daily wage work have gone to them because of which our youth are not getting work
5576241 this is happening for the last many years the infiltration of bangladeshis has become an issue of do or die for the people of assam
5576242 from time to time we have seen the reports from media that northeast is being used as a corridor i dont know how far it is true but from our side we are taking all the steps to see that our borders are not used for infiltration or ex filtration by any group
5576243 the courts have grown all of the requirements have grown
5576244 the system has to grow with the organization and ours has not grown nor kept up with technology
5576245 basically it will operate over our network and it will have direct interfaces to the state reporting systems
5576246 the new system is supposed to be more efficient in terms of helping us do more things
5576247 its supposed to help me generate notices it will automatically flash if there is an open warrant from anywhere our system now has a tendency to lock up it freezes and our information is limited
5576248 if they are not going to service it and we dont have capability to fix it it could shut down the whole tower over there and we cannot do that
5576249 on second thought ill give you a pass i see you everyday

5576275 its what you get when you live in that damn city so full of hippies
5576276 i am from boston and there are very few places that make authentic mexican
5576277 what are you looking at youve never seen an asian man eating 2 super burritos
5576278 its up to us to start winning these games against top opponents
5576279 people are going to criticize us but until we start winning we really dont have a leg to stand on
5576280 look at the coaches in this league look at the facilities weve built attendance is up
5576281 i dont think the nfl thinks this is a bad league
5576282 the acc just has to step up and start winning these games that are played on the big stage
5576283 ive never been the kind of player who has been that close to her teammates
5576284 youre as close as you need to be to get the job done

5576286 if its surgery then im out eight weeks and im done for the season but until the doctor tells me im going to hope for the best
5576287 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over
5576288 one of the best things about the case for the real jesus is that lee addresses the hottest alternative jesus theories of the day youll read about the so called jesus tomb the charge that the manuscripts cant be trusted and the claim that christianity was copied from pagan resurrection myths among other topics this is the one book that will give you the bottom line on all of those alternative theories a bottom line that once again reveals that the most reasonable conclusion is that jesus of nazareth really did rise from the dead for your sins and mine

5576291 how many more artists must die of starvation before we put a stop to this mp3 madness

5576294 as soon as that web site went up last october people stopped buying his music its not surprising either why would anyone in their right mind pay 12 99 for a cd with artwork when they could simply spend seven hours downloading the compressed mp3 files of all the albums songs onto their home computers desktop decompress it into an aiff sound file and then burn the data onto a blank cd
5576295 if we dont do something this technology is going to destroy the record industry
5576296 just imagine if the oil change industry allowed the public to have direct access to oil and oil filters enabling them to change their cars oil themselves without going through jiffy lube or kwik lube people would stop going to oil change shops and the entire industry would collapse we cant let that happen to us

5576299 again at the same moment that i left the place that i stood behind this tree the alarms started to blow according to how i was chasing this ugly ghostess and i was unable to stop in one place so that the alarms might stop my aim was only to see the ugly ghostess clearly because as she was running away so that i might not see her uglyness it was so she was laughing louder at her ugliness and i was also laughing louder at the ugliness as i was chasing her to and fro to look to look at her ugliness it was so this this bush was blowing various fearful alarms and this was pointing out how i was running and how far reachinging in the bush to the ghosts who were chasing at the back to kill me this young ghostess was so ugly that if she hid under a bush and if she looked at her ugly body she would burst suddenly into a great laugh which would last more than one hour and this was detecting her out of the hidden place she might hide herself

5576318 you go five feet then kink it drops almost straight down about 60 degrees
5576319 its like going down roller coaster a just hang on kind of thing
5576320 anyone here who tells you they havent crashed is a liar
5576321 in other races there are plenty of opportunities for guys to pay you back
5576322 but were not a bunch of punk kids riding around town vandalizing stuff
5576323 i like to sing and dance thats who i am thats my personality
5576324 these thieves dont seem to care about their conscience they dont care about right and wrong
5576325 theres definitely an uptick you might call it a rash
5576326 this seems to happen any time the price of metal goes up
5576327 its very troubling not just because of the marker that needs to be replaced but also because of the pain it causes loved ones and the disrespect it shows to veterans
5576328 as long as theres a place for the thieves to sell their stolen property theyre going to steal it
5576329 the military will continue to fight and the political government will continue to negotiate the negotiations have to continue as it is now an issue of saving pakistani society from the hands of the taliban
5576330 it has very fragile public support it doesnt want to lose that public support by going hard after the militants but at the same time it knows it must do so
5576331 this is a positive change but it is just the beginning
5576332 if the government ends these policies the taliban will stop their activities immediately
5576333 the science according to many can only identify a strain of anthrax if they can identify it why didnt they act within the last three years to arrest ivins
5576334 i think its fundamentally changed a lot of peoples views of the canadian economy
5576335 theres clear evidence that the u s economic slump is dragging down canadas economy
5576336 were most concerned about saskatchewan where the doubling of house prices in both regina and saskatoon over the past two years has led us to estimate that these markets are now close to 50 percent overvalued a level that our research denotes as the beginning of the extreme zone where bust risks rise materially
5576337 there is no bubble in the canadian housing sector that has not been our concern
5576338 although people have been charged there is still a lot of work to do and other lines of inquiry that need to be followed up
5576339 the investigators have made a significant stride and hopefully this dreadful case is coming to its conclusion
5576340 all i will say is that my client maintains his innocence
5576341 we were informed this morning of the news from antigua and we are pleased at how the investigation is progressing
5576342 we had a lot of doubters and a lot of people that were saying some not so nice stuff about us the whole of pre season and i hoped that has proved a lot of people wrong
5576343 we knew it was not true we knew it was a load of rubbish and we wanted to prove that we are hopefully going to be right up there once again
5576344 hopefully i will get a bit more freedom to run around the pitch and cause a bit of terror
5576345 last year we played a few different ways and at the end i was let off the leash
5576346 hes had one or two injury problems over the last year or two and so we need to check everything is ok
5576347 he probably needs a couple of weeks to get fit after missing quite a bit of pre season
5576348 we will need to pick him up and get on with it
5576349 from what i saw at liverpool when he used to play at liverpool and came on he is a super player and for england he has never let his country down so it was a sad day for peter
5576350 he is fantastic an experienced international and a top player we are very lucky to have him in our squad
5576351 i have had that all my career at chelsea and i love the competition
5576352 it is great having new players and new stars coming in and trying to learn off them everyday
5576353 our objective is to make our city a permanent constituent of the premier league but realistically this season were looking to stay up
5576354 but we know were going to have a tough job and if we get injuries it could be a problem
5576355 i had to throw kaboul in to play in midfield and obviously he found it difficult
5576356 i had to play the lad in midfield and he had not had a pre season game i brought kaboul in to play centre back but i lost pedro on thursday not that i wanted to but we needed to get some money back in i also lost sulley muntari from last season who gave us fantastic energy
5576357 he could run tackle cover the ground and shoot hes been a big loss
5576358 it has been good for the three players to be involved in the olympics and we are proud of them
5576359 didier was desperately disappointed not to start because hes done well in pre season but we had lots of attacking players in the team and shawky is more defensively minded
5576360 marvin is a player weve bought for the future but in pre season he made a big impact
5576361 we have got the first three points under our belts and it is something physical to build on
5576362 we came in this morning with the players and i asked them how they felt and they came up with answers and hopefully we will learn from it
5576363 i want the players to have an intelligence level which they can change to any given situation
5576364 the first 20 minutes we didnt really cope with the way fulham passed the ball but when geovanni scored that settled us down
5576365 the emphasis is on the cliche of goals change games
5576366 weve got a small squad but we believe its a good one and i want to keep everybody involved this season
5576367 i was delighted with the attitude and the character we showed for the spurs game and i want to have a look at a couple of games before making a final decision
5576368 im pleased to have added justin hoyte to the squad but we have no more bids in at the moment and it may stay that way
5576369 it may leave us a little bit short but then we have players who have proved they can play in a number of positions
5576370 mommy why did you tell me there was going to be an earthquake
5576371 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this
5576372 if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response we have all the necessary resources political economic and military
5576373 well see if they can turn their attention to governance and get a handle on their problems
5576374 they have been using the musharraf thing as an excuse for non governance
5576375 this is really the moment of truth for pakistan if this fails it is unclear what will happen
5576376 it will take the new government a full year to work things out on counterterrorism a year to make the mistakes they have to make it is a huge experiment
5576377 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing
5576378 pakistan is a critical theater in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5576379 were confident that we will maintain a good relationship with the government of pakistan
5576380 had a good meeting with the prime minister a couple of weeks ago in washington the pakistanis realize that the threat of terrorism the threat of extremism is a threat to them as well as the rest of the world
5576381 he hasnt effectively been leading pakistan for the last six months
5576382 youre truly not going to see any great changes in pakistan with musharrafs resignation with the exception you will start to see greater political infighting among the coalition partners
5576383 you could count on him to make tough decisions even though you could never count on him to completely follow through
5576384 it will probably be much harder to get decisive action as we did with musharraf the good news is that the democracy process is moving forward and it may be possible to create a more durable political framework
5576385 weve wracked our brains to think of some kind of captive approach we can do by taking it in and rearing it ourselves but it seems to be impossible in australia and possibly around the world
5576386 its just heartbreaking the only thing we can do is monitor the little fella and hope he finds a new mum
5576387 since i came here ive played as a winger but i will do what the manager wants me to do
5576388 i played most of my career as a winger but i have played as a striker before
5576389 i want to play and i want to be part of the team so it doesnt matter where i play the manager said i have something he likes as a striker so i have to keep showing him why i should be picked i will keep trying and when i get the chances i will try to score some goals
5576390 i was very pleased with my goal but it would have been better if we had won the game
5576391 we are a young side and some more promising youngsters have come through for this season but they have all got the quality which you need to have if you play for arsenal
5576392 we know that we are very short on numbers but we need to get the best out of the numbers that weve got at the moment
5576393 everyones buzzing we dont think we can get beat by anyone its a bit dangerous but im confident
5576394 i wouldnt say theres pressure but theres hope theres hope from our country and other african countries hoping that we can go and make africa proud
5576395 it is obviously disappointing not to be selected and you want to be playing for your country
5576396 but if mr capello doesnt put you in the squad then we have to go out like on sunday and prove him wrong and i think we myself and ashley young did that today
5576397 that is all you can do really all we can do is play good football for our clubs it is out of our hands whether or not we are selected
5576398 mr capello does come to villa quite a lot and i am not going to give up we have just got to keep doing the business for our club that is all we can do
5576399 then if he doesnt want to pick us he doesnt want to pick us

5576404 we have come from a different background and this is a mandate the people have given to us to lead the country to peace
5576405 its a definite possibility at the rate things are going
5576406 im moving around im taking drops im shuffling and its only been a little over a week
5576407 but as soon as that swellings out itll be good to go
5576408 i cant not practice all week just do my rehab and fly to virginia and play
5576409 when we get into game planning for a team we dont need a million plays we need to have enough plays to where it can win us a football game enough plays to where these guys can understand and go out and play really fast
5576410 its not a big deal hes going to get back
5576411 he left our prison early this morning and he is now already far from here
5576412 he has served his sentence and the authorities in vietnam will deport him he does not have any sentence to serve in london if he wants to stop wherever he wants to he can do that
5576413 the only problem is the countries he wants to go to because he has to get a visa
5576414 weve got to pick up our game for sure the last four or five games weve just been a little flat
5576415 i knew joe would eventually build an organization to do this
5576416 hinskes been a pretty hot hitter lately i left a changeup up to him same thing with floyd i tried to get a fastball in but left it up you leave balls up to major league hitters thats whats going to happen
5576417 their pitching staff has done a good job against everybody
5576418 whats hurt us here is what happens in the batters box we havent swung the bats well in what should be a pretty good hitters park
5576419 it doesnt matter how good they are they were making pitches and getting outs
5576420 despite the improved security environment no one in baghdad including gen
5576421 its a bit of a disservice to our troops in the field and the iraqis to simply wash our hands of the war and assume the
5576422 a first i must say felt a bit like elizabeth taylor
5576423 some of my plans and schemes have had to be put on hold because there is not much i can do if i cant walk properly
5576424 the surgery went as planned and annie is now recuperating at home annie would like to send her thanks and appreciation to all that have sent their well wishes in the past few days
5576425 i did ichat with reggie and i had my costume on for his approval
5576426 my first part of the show started off in the bathtub in the middle of the club in a vintage all sequin one piece bathing suit with puff sleeves and a beach ball but my second look was my
5576427 it went amazingly well and was the best experience ever
5576428 he could have scored a nice coup if he had pulled off a power sharing agreement
5576429 its way too late for mbeki to regain his reputation he is yesterdays man mbeki has proven he cant produce the goods
5576430 it was certainly a sting for sadcs disunity to come out in the open like that usually these things are shoved under the carpet
5576431 i flew in two days ago to prepare the boat
5576432 not much to do on a dock like this but add extra lines and make sure the boat can rise and fall with the tide
5576433 this isnt a hurricane if the media wasnt down here hyping this up this would be a non event
5576434 they should continue to stay calm and be smart and make sure they exercise common sense
5576435 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5576436 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5576437 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5576438 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there
5576439 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5576440 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5576441 i wish it was sort of true being on quidditch with him would be kind of cool
5576442 we say join the club it makes us feel old too
5576443 with traffic android you schedule when and where you social bookmark prepare for increased traffic
5576444 perverse monetary policy was the greatest cause of the great depression but five non monetary missteps were important in making the depression great and the same missteps damaged the global economy as well while many are thinking about the depression few seem concerned about replicating these foolish five today
5576445 i suggest to you that you and mr sanhueza said to him mr guirguis that if he didnt buy the goods you would not give him any more work
5576446 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5576447 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5576448 in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5576449 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5576450 even in retrospect obama would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5576451 strengthening is expected tonight and tuesday and fay is forecast to be at or near hurricane strength winds of 119km h as it approaches the southwestern coast of florida
5576452 tornadoes are likely in some areas tonight and tomorrow and maybe even into the next few days
5576453 this project will not only bring the pilbaras electricity system into the 21st century but the communities that rely on that system will flourish as a result
5576454 we have a long term vision for the pilbara and this is the cornerstone to fulfilling those plans
5576455 the prospect of an operational electricity market has already resulted in two independent private sector proposals being put to the government for the provision of up to 2 000mw of electricity for 2013
5576456 in between the police strike force piccadilly and ourselves we basically made atms too hard a target and not a profitable target to attack
5576457 weve had a number of them attacked and the thieves have abandoned their attack quite quickly once theyve realised theyve been beaten
5576458 when the problem was occurring the clients wanted to have it not too public until they got some of them out in the field and started defeating these ram raiders
5576459 foleys probably done a little bit more today in our skills session just from a running point of view than what browny did
5576460 browny was still stationary today but its only early in the week so well give both those boys an opportunity to come up later in the week
5576461 id sort of say that nathan foleys ahead of nathan brown at the minute
5576462 their contested footy games improved and their clearance footy games improved immeasurably in the second half of the year which makes them a more dangerous item than what they perhaps were in the first half of the year so we dont take them lightly
5576463 its important for our guys to know they can compete with sides that have been right up there for the entire year so i think that thats really important
5576464 i think also from a direction point of view as much as i can sit there and say that i believe in our younger group of players and i think were very even in a group of players that are coming through
5576465 just because we are out of step with other states doesnt mean we are wrong
5576466 it can be very difficult for juries to follow what has happened
5576467 what if a jury cannot reach an 11 1 majority decision the way is now cleared to allow 10 2 or nine to three verdicts
5576468 a majority verdict weakens the whole basis of what a jury is supposed to do reach unanimous agreement on guilt or innocence
5576469 economic growth has been sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices and weaker growth in exports
5576470 global financial markets remain unstable and there are downside risks to the world economy particularly the us economy
5576471 while growth will likely remain sluggish for the time being it is expected to return gradually onto a moderate growth path as commodity prices level out and overseas economies move out of their deceleration phase
5576472 is expected to be somewhat higher over the coming months but to moderate gradually thereafter thus it is likely that the economy will return onto a sustainable growth path with price stability
5576473 theres nobody down there in dire straits because they dont have any food or water right now
5576474 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5576475 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5576476 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5576477 there was no way of hiking back there was no way of getting out
5576478 i think you just have those games where you feel like youre hitting the ball well
5576479 at the moment i feel like im striking the ball as good as i have ever have
5576480 stats are irrelevant the biggest thing is if the teams going well then im happy
5576481 its just one of the jobs and its something that i look forward to
5576482 i havent changed a real lot maybe i just had easier shots thats all it was theyve just been closer to the posts
5576483 if you can strike while the iron is hot if you can take advantage of field position and pressure and momentum then the game does have a fair amount of chemistry to it
5576484 no not psychological i dont think it is at all
5576485 i think the tri nations shows how tough it is to win away from home obviously south africa did it in new zealand which was a huge effort
5576486 its just the way this competition is your home games are the ones that you really want to win and you really have to win
5576487 its not something that weve spoken about too much i suppose the history its more just this year
5576488 weve been given our opportunities now weve got two games over here so wed like to win both of them
5576489 whether the springboks won or lost wed still go into the game with a bit of confidence
5576490 weve got a lot of confidence within our group and within the players that weve got here so it doesnt matter which side were playing against or the results that have happened previously
5576491 we know this games going to be a tough game against the springboks were not taking it lightly but within our squad were confident in our own abilities
5576492 weve got two halfbacks with us and theres other players as well with us this time whove played in that position before the likes of matt giteau
5576493 i think in the first instance it probably wouldnt be a surprise to you that well look to experience
5576494 so im giving you an insight there that we dont normally do ive broken protocol there
5576495 experience is valuable but it comes down to how you use that
5576496 what previous experience in these sort of contests gives you is an insight but if you then dont use that to your best advantage then its not much value
5576497 they ran today and reported no ill effects on that so we just have to see how they go see how they respond to that work in particular tomorrow and just push on and take it as it comes
5576498 well consider our selection and that will pertain to the springboks
5576499 well look at what we believe will serve us best we havent made those decisions yet believe it or not so well have those discussions and well settle on a combination
5576500 the reality is you can only live in the moment and you can only deal with the challenges that youre presented with at any given point in time and weve got an opportunity coming this weekend and we are not thinking beyond that
5576501 foles has accepted a position with the waratahs which is great for him gives him some certainty
5576502 we knew the market for luxury watches existed but it is only after careful planning and analysis that we are launching our new collection called ceramica
5576503 we have a set clientele that splurges on our watches
5576504 we have to improve our distribution strategies here by choosing the right malls to display our products and the right sales staff to push sales
5576505 we have to be there at the right place at the right time
5576506 our turnover is not adequate but we have improved a lot in the past five years and are aiming for more
5576507 bollywood has a great influence on everyone people try to emote to actors in every sense brand recognition is very important in brand promotion and known faces give your brand instant recognition
5576508 a brand has to have a name and face only then will it sell
5576509 i believe in quality watches so even if i were to purchase one watch i would prefer it to be the best
5576510 we are not suggesting that a global slowdown will have zero impact on grain demand but we want to highlight the weak historical correlation
5576511 the point is that fertilizer stocks are being grouped with industrial metals and energy when the supply demand characteristics are arguably very different
5576512 this isnt a cause for panic among pregnant women taking these medicines
5576513 the australian product information currently contains warnings about the potential for pancreatitis to occur with this medicine

5576605 fear of smallpox has played nicely into the overall strategy of the bush administration to militarize public health
5576606 was in effect abducted while attempting to transit at jfk airport
5576607 the administration has argued that the president has unilateral executive power in the war on terror to violate even criminal laws and when it has been challenged on that assertion it has argued that the courts cant even rule on that assertion of power because the alleged criminal violation is a state secret

5576611 if i go then the story of the self defense forces is incomplete
5576612 i see this with huge and profound concern because it could leave many cases in impunity

5576617 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5576618 still musharraf was a one man go to guy in pakistan now who do we speak to these are very uncertain times

5576623 washington aug 18 2008 prnewswire usnewswire via comtex as john mccain addressed the veterans of foreign wars vfw in orlando fl this morning he was practicing more of the same old politics mccain claims to be an advocate for americas veterans despite his record on veterans issues like bush mccain will continue sending american soldiers along with billions of dollars to iraq and afghanistan but hell block programs for health care and education for veterans here at home
5576624 its more about mcgriff than anybody else i know i always looked at and admired him most
5576625 he made very little mistakes he made one against me hes been getting me out with that pitch before it was a hard sinker in basically i just made an adjustment so i was able to get out in front of it and keep it from getting in on the handle
5576626 the fact that we came back after being down with their guy pitching a good game and it looked like we could have given it up we could have come in to the clubhouse a real sad bunch but we didnt to come on the road and win against a team that can really hit i thought was pretty good

5576748 we believe that the pace of development within our territories is unsustainable and we are deeply concerned that governments are permitting development to proceed without our consent
5576749 i think this will send a strong message to government
5576750 as first nations people were supposed to stay quiet and let everything be no more
5576751 what is happening here in this region is affecting everybody we as first nations people have the power to let the government and industry know no more
5576752 weve taken some bold steps and bold steps are what we need
5576753 this is frankly an eye opener for our people what the people are experiencing here
5576754 how many barrels of oil is my life worth to you
5576755 i hope some of this footage ends up in the media
5576756 these are real lives were talking about lionel lepine questioned how many more would die before the locals concerns were taken seriously
5576757 that river would be pristine if it was flowing the other way
5576758 its hard to take back time and undo the damage
5576759 what is it going to look like 100 years from now
5576760 people came together and helped each other out there were times there when we thought people were gonna die we were definitely nervous for ourselves
5576761 one day some of the other teachers and i decided to go on a trip to 14 000 foot pikes peak we hired a prairie wagon near the top we had to leave the wagon and go the rest of the way on mules i was very tired but when i saw the view i felt great joy all the wonder of america seemed displayed there with the sea like expanse
5576762 it may be true that the law cannot change the heart but it can restrain the heartless
5576763 is that it is not a magnificent and attractive technical engineering business for big companies to invest in but rather a community program aimed at meticulous care of thousands of people
5576764 raise the indigenous voice in defense of sacred water water democracy
5576765 water is always moving unless there is human intervention intervention is the right to use not own and privatize to the exclusion of others who enjoy equal access to use water it is important to distinguish between sovereign ownership and control of water enjoyed by states or nations through which water flows or moves and private ownership sovereign state ownership is not the same and has to do with control and use of water for the public welfare health and safety not for private profit
5576766 human rights are formulated in terms of individuals not in terms of rights and obligations of states vis vis other states as international law provisions generally do
5576767 an inseparable part of the right is control and sovereignty of local communities over their natural heritage and therefore over the management of their sources of water and over the use of the territories producing this water the watersheds and aquifer recharge areas
5576768 the very mention of this supposed conflict water for human use versus water for nature reflects a lack of consciousness of the essential fact that the very existence of water depends on the sustainable management and conservation of ecosystems progress at the united nations
5576769 while development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights the lack of development may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human rights
5576770 the right to water is an element that is indissociable from human dignity
5576771 so seriously flawed as to represent a retreat from current international legal protection for the human right to water
5576772 under these rules water is regarded as a good an investment and service and as such it is subject to binding disciplines that severely constrain the capacity of governments to establish or maintain policies laws and practices needed to protect human rights the environment or other non commercial societal goals that may impede the private rights entrenched by these trade and investment agreements
5576773 the codification of such private rights creates an obvious and serious impediment to the realization of the human right to water
5576774 the public service of water supply for human consumption will be served exclusively and directly by state legal persons
5576775 south american convention for human rights and access for all living beings to water
5576776 a lot of people get lost in the world of computer simulation
5576777 im not sure employers are recognizing the importance of hands on
5576778 children how to build objects like gravity powered wooden roller coasters with their hands
5576779 about 100 adobe designers wrestle with plastic beads small electronic displays ikea water glasses and tiny sensors to create wacky motion games
5576780 experimenting with hands on activities comes from the difficulty of measuring the value of paying employees to say build a go cart or a radio set while in the office
5576781 products as diverse as cars and cellphones are almost entirely designed on a computer screen
5576782 you need your hands to verify experimentally a technology that doesnt exist
5576783 all your intelligence isnt in your brain you learn through your hands
5576784 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance
5576785 the patience of our soldiers in trying to uphold the primacy of the peace process is very commendable but at some point we really have to act decisively
5576786 we regret the loss of lives and property in lanao del norte but we would to emphasise that the milf leadership has not authorised these actions
5576787 if they cant control them the government will certainly control them and we will undertake our mandate to protect the people and the communities and we cannot renege on that constitutional mandate
5576788 we will pursue and take aggressive action against the perpetrators of the dastardly acts committed against innocent civilians
5576789 time stands still best in moments that look suspiciously like ordinary life
5576790 and all the loveliest things there be come simply so it seems to me
5576791 there are these changes in the south atlantic an area where the magnetic field has the smallest envelope at one third of what is normal
5576792 if there are magnetic storms and high energy particles coming from the sun the satellites could be affected and their connections could be lost
5576793 whats the most gut wrenching decision youve ever had to make
5576794 as tough a decision that ive had to make not only because there were political consequences but also because saddam hussein was a bad person and there was no doubt he meant america ill
5576795 we had a code of conduct that said you only leave by order of capture
5576796 in the spirit of full disclosure im very happy i didnt know the war was going to last for another three years or so
5576797 went against party loyalty and maybe even against your own best interest for the good of america
5576798 well ill give you an example that in fact i worked with john mccain on
5576799 and that was the issue of campaign ethics reform and finance reform
5576800 my knowledge and my background told me that a few hundred marines in a situation like that could not successfully carry out any kind of peacekeeping mission and i thought they were going into harms way
5576801 what would be the greatest moral failure in your life and what would be the greatest moral failure of america
5576802 the failure of my first marriage its my greatest moral failure
5576803 he could have avoided that altogether or come up with some other answer
5576804 but he very quickly cleanly and clearly confessed his failure
5576805 the clarity of confessing his failure there will be respect in the evangelical community for doing so
5576806 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5576807 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5576808 but let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is there is a moral and ethical content to this issue so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue i think is not paying attention so that would be point number one
5576809 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5576810 okay we dont have to go longer on that one
5576811 abortion and marriage are still pivotal issues but i think that abortion is probably more pivotal than marriage
5576812 abortion is still very very solid with this group even the younger ones who are more liberal on marriage life is a real delineating factor
5576813 i thought sen obamas statement in quoting matthew 25 which is my favorite scripture since i was in high school whatever you do to the least of my brethren you do likewise to me when as a matter of record he voted against a ban on partial birth abortion well i find it discouraging and disingenuous for him to talk about the least of our brethren
5576814 other evils there are that may come yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set uprooting the evil in the fields that we know so that those who live after may have clean earth to till what weather they shall have is not ours to rule
5576815 lanticomunismo un dovere morale siamo pronti ad eliminare il comunismo in italia
5576816 the way youre thinking youre refusing to go seek help because youre so full of yourself you think youre better than those other people that made you stopped going to church you think youre so much wiser than those that may make mistakes on their beliefs thats not what church is about church is about your relationship with your god not about what it stands for
5576817 innovators are productive over a narrowing span of their life cycle
5576818 biographical data over the past century for more than 700 nobel laureates and renowned inventors in the early 20th century he found researchers at the times of their greatest contributions were slightly more than 36 years old in recent decades innovation became increasingly rare with the peak age of contribution rising toward age 40 meanwhile the frequency of key contributions has consistently diminished by researchers in their early or mid 50s
5576819 easier access to the frontier allowing people to make contributions at younger ages
5576820 tackle the right problems effectively meanwhile theres a belief that older researchers are akin to aging athletes full of knowledge but no longer nimble enough to be superstars
5576821 recent college graduates and other fresh research hires with experienced mentors
5576822 age doesnt jump out at me as a strong indicator of inventiveness
5576823 new techniques and capabilities are developing so fast that even young researchers can make huge contributions
5576824 only possible because of deep understanding of the physics principles involved
5576825 preseason is important but the idea is to be ready for when the regular season kicks off if i can be out there im going to be out there but that remains to be seen we spent some time this weekend getting treatment on my foot just hoping it responds quickly like it usually does
5576826 its entirely different than the super bowl same side of the body and same leg but different injury
5576827 ive tried to get treatment this week im feeling better every day its going to end up being up to the coach and what he wants to do but i think hes been coaching long enough to understand that the first game in september is whats going to be important for us
5576828 as far as making tackles making sure everything was ok with the legs and shoulders it always takes those initial hits
5576829 especially on kickoff returns where you want to get hit at least once or twice to let yourself know everythings ok the defense we played allowed me to break on balls as far as making tackles and getting in good position to try and make tackles
5576830 what difference will this thing were fighting about make in ten years in one year in a month

5576834 i hope im alive to see it i dont think its going to happen soon but then again i thought it was going to take longer than it did for us to get where we are today theres still a lot of work to be done but seeing mixed martial arts in the olympics would be incredible if you combine boxing judo and wrestling what do you have thats what mixed martial arts is
5576835 how do i get to the top of a mans world

5576850 the sword of the spirit which is the word of god
5576851 god has not given you a spirit of fear but of love power and a sound mind
5576852 and you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself there is no other commandment greater than these
5576853 love is patient and kind love does not envy or boast it is not arrogant or rude it does not insist on its own way it is not irritable or resentful it does not rejoice at wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth
5576854 for though we walk in the flesh we are not waging war according to the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds we destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of god and take every thought captive to obey christ being ready to punish every disobedience when your obedience is complete
5576855 and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus
5576856 therefore preparing your minds for action and being sober minded set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of jesus christ
5576857 to set the mind on the flesh is death but to set the mind on the spirit is life and

5576860 there was a need to increase awareness in the sport optics binoculars area
5576861 we dont have the resources to make the same level of presence at the dealers counters as our competitors do
5576862 its important for us to help the consumer be more aware so that they ask about our products when they are at the counter or online and secondly that they ask the dealers to consider stocking us
5576863 we drove traffic to the site through publicity news releases a wire story and word of mouth circulating from the dealers
5576864 it brings the best of the in store experience to the online model its the next best thing to being there and in some ways its actually better than being there

5576882 as a muchos vi ateros se les hac a dif cil poder seguir produciendo por lo que se ve an casi obligados a vender sus tierras
5576883 la cooperativa se ha transformado en un estorbo para algunos bodegueros un dolor de cabeza
5576884 ahora la comercializaci n es m s justa para ese peque o vi atero que ya no vende uva sino que pas a formar parte de un conjunto de socios que vende vino
5576885 cuando me sum ya estaba en marcha la elaboraci n del vino y su fraccionado por lo que lo primero en que nos enfocamos fue en buscar los lugares de venta y participar en exposiciones que nos permitieran dar a conocer nuestro vino algo que logramos en distintas ferias de buenos aires tucum n jujuy y salta capital luego en 2007 empezamos a ajustar m s el manejo con las vi as algo en los que nos ayud mucho el asesoramiento de colegas del inta san juan
5576886 todav a somos j venes como cooperativa pero gracias a dios y a la virgen estamos creciendo de a poquito pero crecemos
5576887 despu s ya podr dedicarme de lleno a la cooperativa
5576888 la actividad es la que nos mantiene bien nunca nos quedamos quietas
5576889 en especial mi deseo es que triunfemos pero somos nuevos y en la cancha se ven los pingos
5576890 ellas son la voz de la experiencia y como tal son muy importantes para nosotros los m s j venes
5576891 fortalecer la identidad del productor mejorando sus ingresos y sus vi edos de manera que los peque os agricultores puedan mantener sus fincas
5576892 nos damos cuenta que tenemos futuro que podemos torcer el destino incierto que ten amos antes de empezar a trabajar de manera conjunta
5576893 no queremos bolsones de alimentos hay compa eros que tienen el terreno pero que terminan vendi ndolo porque no cuentan con la plata necesaria para ponerlo a producir hacen falta subsidios para que el peque o productor se quede a trabajar su tierra
5576894 el objetivo es crecer y poder mejorar los ingresos de la mayor cantidad de peque os productores ya no tan s lo de uvas finas
5576895 cuando deba elegir entre comprar trassoles o el vino de alguna bodega grande piense que nosotros lo necesitamos
5576896 a diferencia de lo que ocurre hoy que contratamos el servicio de un tercero para procesar nuestra uva el contar con bodega propia nos permitir a dise ar una mejor estrategia de cosecha haci ndola de manera escalonada seg n las labores planificadas y la maduraci n ideal de cada vi edo hoy cuando la bodega que nos elabora el vino tiene un espacio libre dentro de su producci n nos llama y nosotros tenemos que correr para cumplir con la entrega
5576897 si el estado provincial nos da una mano a trav s de un cr dito acordado de palabra con el ministerio de desarrollo econ mico en octubre estar amos fraccionando el vino de la cosecha 2008 y el a o pr ximo podr amos elaborar el vino nosotros mismos
5576898 puedan quedarse en el pago y no deban emigrar hacia las grandes ciudades en busca de un destino que no siempre termina siendo el mejor
5576899 ya hay cinco changos de la cooperativa que empezaron a cursar la carrera este a o esto es muy importante para nosotros porque se nos hubiera hecho muy dif cil mandar a capacitar a alg n socio a mendoza o contratar un en logo
5576900 contar con bodega y en logos le dar una mayor identidad a nuestro vino
5576901 sabemos que con trabajo vamos a tener xito quiz s ste se demor un poco m s por no contar con todas las herramientas necesarias pero seguiremos adelante

5576981 i dont want women to think that just because theyre feeling stressed they will get cervical cancer
5576982 you want something but dont get it you kill and covet but you cannot have what you want you quarrel and fight you do not have because you do not ask god when you ask you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives that you may spend what you get on your own pleasures
5576983 submit yourself then to god resist the devil and he will flee from you
5576984 therefore my dear friends as you have always obeyed not only in my presence but now much more in my absence continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is god who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose do everything without complaining or arguing so that you may become blameless and pure children of god without fault in a crooked and depraved generation in which you shine like stars in the universe as you hold out the word of life in order that i may boast on the day of christ that i did not run or labor for nothing
5576985 but even if i am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith i am glad and rejoice with all of you so you too should be glad and rejoice with me

5577007 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5577008 we are not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months we are going to see a whopper we are going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5577009 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over

5577011 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime they are great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
5577012 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
5577013 cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the united states
5577014 we are now facing the most serious economic situation in two decades with the exchequer situation continuing to deteriorate live register numbers rocketing with workers losing jobs across many sectors inflation again touching 5 per cent and for the first time for more than two decades a failure to conclude a national pay agreement

5577022 for the past two weeks including on my annual bike tour i have listened and talked with people throughout michigans second congressional district about the high cost of energy
5577023 they are sometimes driving 90 to 120 miles back and forth to work every day and it is severely impacting their pocketbook
5577024 high energy prices impose economic hardship and negatively impact the u s economy
5577025 we cannot continue to send 700 billion annually overseas when we can invest that money into our own economy to stabilize prices and create jobs
5577026 it has been more than two weeks and more than 100 floor speeches by republican members of congress but no bill has yet been brought to the floor
5577027 the issue is about much more than energy it is about the economy jobs and national security americans are demanding a response from congress and we have a responsibility to act upon their behalf

5577034 there is no known permanent lasting effect on the muscular system aside from any injuries that may result from an associated fall
5577035 these include letting the water settle in a pond so a lot of the eggs from worms drop out of the water and irrigating around the crops rather than on top of them
5577036 when the crop is harvested it also needs to be washed with fresh clean water in the market and that water needs to be constantly changed so everything else is not contaminated the institute said in a report presented at the world water week summit in stockholm sweden
5577037 it is a pretty useful way of treating water in the sense that if the water just went straight into a river it would cause a lot more eutrophication problems further downstream
5577038 so in a way it is performing an ecological service by cleaning up some of the water and recycling the nutrients
5577039 if this practice is going to be increasingly commonplace and more and more people are going to be eating food produced this way then there needs to be a bit more concern about the heavy metals and other contaminants in there

5577052 we found that the workers were significantly above the male suicide rate for queensland in the active population
5577053 the male suicide rate in the active population is 17 74 per 100 000 compared to 36 58 for the agricultural male workers
5577054 one of the biggest things in the past has been the fear that probably media has sensationalised some of the statistics that have been quoted
5577055 but this is the first time that weve actually looked really closely and reliably at a very fixed working population which hasnt been done before and have identified that yes they are at quite significantly higher risk
5577056 i guess it lays the foundations for really needing to investigate more thoroughly what are the very specific risk factors for agriculture workers
5577057 it puts huge pressure on farm families it provides both financial and emotional impacts for a farming family and hence does contribute towards suicide rates
5577058 farmers and farm workers live in a very isolated position they are both physically and socially isolated from others so if their thinking is getting shifted and they are under this stress or they are suffering any mental health condition its not so readily picked up by others
5577059 then clearly theyve got the location that makes it easier perhaps for them to go through and commit suicide without being noticed and under the scrutiny of other people
5577060 wd believes that some biochemical pathways including the blood clotting cascade are evidence for an intelligent designer hoewever like the eye im sure a case could be made i dont have any references right now showing how the blood clotting mechanisms has evolved by natural selection

5577121 this 2 9 per cent increase represents a balanced and a moderate response to revenue instability caused by a couple things one of them is the cap on residential assessments which will place a ceiling on the province this year at 2 3 per cent this was predicted across the province by all municipalities that this is exactly what would have to happen
5577122 i believe these increases are fair and moderate in the residential and commercial rates and will enable the town of new glasgow to continue to service our residents and our community well while offsetting demands placed on the budget by increased operating costs

5577124 we need water access so weve kind of identified the section were most interest in on the left hand side of the plant
5577125 for our purposes the sooner we can get the site the better so we can begin decommissioning the plant and get construction started down there to process the beets planted in nova scotia this fall
5577126 were looking at a couple of other sites but theyre not as attractive as trenton
5577127 we have no requirements other than the beets we even use the water thats in the beets in our production most people dont quite understand what it is we want to do theres no waste stream from this and theres the capacity to make some of the equipment we need right in trenton
5577128 well have barriers and restrictions in place but its not as combustible as gasoline would be for instance

5577210 as you work towards victory you will be guided by the compass of your values and those are values you and i share
5577211 i think the framers of the constitution understood very well
5577212 the best thing the government could do for religion was to simply leave it alone
5577213 the programs i remember from those days were about jewish adventures jewish heroes jews doing things in the public world whether it was the battle of the warsaw ghetto or louis brandeis
5577214 it stood for the proposition that judaism was relevant to the world we lived in
5577215 the genius of krents and wishengrad and finkelstein was that they decided to use drama to convey their message
5577216 to take the more abstruse concepts and ideas of jewish tradition and to present them in a way that would be easily understood by the uninformed jew or non jew
5577217 the greatness of life is experienced in facing that challenge rather than in just having satisfaction
5577218 arabs raise as one man and fight for your sacred rights kill the jews wherever you find them
5577219 one day we will slit the throat of all the jews
5577220 i dont know that people see white when they look at me
5577221 ive been around for a long time fifty four years is a long time
5577222 shes been there from the very beginning shes put her neck out more than most guyanese
5577223 a woman for the u s to keep an eye on
5577224 if you want love you will merely receive an empty envelope
5577225 if you want an empty envelope you will receive love all the love in the world
5577226 you think youll sit at home and some guy will knock on your door
5577227 i dont like to do it but i must do it
5577228 every pair a person walked every pair a person walked
5577229 maybe i shouldnt have come here i tried all these years to put up with it and be a normal person not to have always a chip on my shoulder to feel that i am different because of the thing that i lived through
5577230 for all the years i wouldnt step into poland for being afraid that the memories will be so alive that i wouldnt be able to put up with it i can live with it very well now and be happy that i did it
5577231 which is the young people should learn about it it shouldnt be forgotten
5577232 it is not a language that flows out of you
5577233 hebrew doesnt belong to the jews anymore says an arab writer
5577234 a man who loses his mother tongue is crippled for life
5577235 but when i talk about the kibbutz i spit out all the poison
5577236 afraid to stay on the kibbutz and feel responsible for other peoples lives
5577237 enough talented people to deal with large amounts of money
5577238 who was my friend who was my enemy how could they be so kind to me and at the same time kill others so horribly what set us apart a simple foreskin
5577239 i began to understand that each person must have his own nation
5577240 each person must have his own home each person must have his own freedom i understood that all of this was impossible in soviet russia
5577241 to suddenly be in refusal after having once received permission to leave after we were almost free this was absolutely horrifying we had already tasted freedom we had stood on that border which divides bondage from freedom
5577242 is it warm in here or am i the only one dressed for poland in the 1700s
5577243 ive got to get this judaism out my system its interfering with my true spiritual path
5577244 three circumcisions is not a religious covenant its a fetish
5577245 do i throw my lot in with the jewish people come what may
5577246 it may be more difficult and you may have to drive to dallas to get a matzah
5577247 but its still possible to get a matzah in texas
5577248 the jewish peddlers were the life support for these ranch people
5577249 they filled a void that was really an essential part of the development of west texas
5577250 stop the bus tell shelan to get off the bus your mother just called us and told us she didnt want you to play tomorrow rosh hashana
5577251 collect together the long scattered people and let their gathering place be in the land of milk and honey
5577252 may the children of the stock of abraham who dwell in this land continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants
5577253 theres no anti semitism so its easier to assimilate then live a jewish life one has to fight against that way its not bad but we want our children to continue our heritage
5577254 our community has been without a rabbi for 30 years
5577255 when we were finally about 30 we realized there were two choices
5577256 not to marry and have children or adapt and live the life we were dealt to live
5577257 every so often we fall down and then we pick ourselves up as were picking ourselves up they leave us then we have to find others thats our life
5577258 weve tilled this land and we loved it and suffered and we died for the land
5577259 we have no other land for a banana plot except the yemenites land which we must have
5577260 yall do i have to do the splits im a christian
5577261 listen despite the hopes of many an afc south team and the bears peyton manning will start week one its a given write it down its about as automatic as it gets

5577268 a theme song will make your podcast sound professional right from the start
5577269 truly i say to you it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
5577270 with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible
5577271 we have left everything and followed you what then shall we have
5577272 truly i say to you in the new world when the son of man shall sit on his glorious throne you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
5577273 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
5577274 every one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for my names sake will receive a hundredfold and inherit eternal life but many that are first will be last and the last first
5577275 you didnt hurt your baby youre body did you are so small and he was so big and born so fast
5577276 would it be all right if we just sat and
5577277 as the dust settles from the breakdown of the wto negotiations in geneva some parties are recognising that there was a good package of results left on the table zoellick said
5577278 it would be a mistake for the world economy and harmful for developing countries not to retrieve it
5577279 given the high food prices around the world and the need for poor people to lower their cost of food it just does not make sense for the doha negotiations to founder upon this barrier
5577280 since the purpose of a safeguard is to help cushion the effect of a significant increase in imports on local producers an acceptable justification for the safeguard could require examination of factors in addition to increased trade flows
5577281 a big problem with safeguards is that once a country triggers them it can take two years or more to challenge the grounds for imposing them he said
5577282 in the meantime the new barriers block trade so a compromise could create a speedy due process for challenges without appeal
5577283 it may be understandable that tired negotiators couldnt assemble these and perhaps other variables in a way to solve the problem zoellick said
5577284 there is a good doha deal still to be seized
5577285 like a heaping plate of the foods i grew up with tex mex bbq and chicken fried steak
5577286 the lion is special because it is strong and its not scared of anyone
5577287 every time i look at the pictures i remember them
5577288 just continue to do what you do and never be scared of them
5577289 the very people who are attracted to politics in the first place
5577290 are people who have a propensity towards power and the sex drive frankly
5577291 if you cant be ethical to those closest to you how are you going to be ethical for millions of people
5577292 the army and the public gradually turn into an animal and repression always goes on to the last minute
5577293 french soldiers in algeria the whites in south africa or there where all comparisons are forbidden nazi germany when they did it none of them thought it was wrong they really really really thought they were saving their people
5577294 a disgrace to the state of israel youre a friend to arafat
5577295 why did i want to be a soldier hero as a boy
5577296 i dont think much while selecting a role i do whatever makes me happy but fortunately for me my films are a nice mix of different characters for every masala film i also have a corporate an apaharan and the extremely arty pankh to boast of i have enjoyed doing the comedies too as they are fun and we also have a blast on the sets i am happy with the roles that i have done
5577297 i am intelligent enough to realise that women are always secondary in this male dominated industry look at the way shah rukh khan salman and aamir are still going strong but we actresses can never even dream of such an inning the only actress in bollywood who has been able to beat this system is aishwarya rai bachchan you can call it her luck or just being at the right place at the right time but the fact is that she has achieved this feat in fact her fame goes beyond bollywood as she is the only one who is recognised in hollywood this is something which cant be said for even srk or big b
5577298 they are never of my making but yes there is one to my credit almost every day i dont know how these rumours about me acting pricey and having differences with deepika padukone got started i am not crazy to insist that i will sit next to ranbir or will make an entry with him on the sets of a television programme i know that the two of them are together in fact i gel very well with deepika in fact she is the only actress with whom i dont mind sharing a vehicle this is something i would never do with any other female star then there was this big fuss about my having refused to shoot with shahid and vidya balan for the finale of a music reality show recently the fact is that the channel and the title sponsorer for whose product im the brand ambassador had some differences i was asked not to go for the shoot then they asked me to do so the next day and i went
5577299 my new home is taking up a lot of my time all i want is a comfortable bed a nice kitchen were tasty food can be prepared and a luxurious bath i think we guys deserve at least this much after a long and tiring day im working on this and will be ready to enjoy it by early next year
5577300 it was just that i arrived at capri for a films shoot and fell in love with the place so i called up john to share my joy with him the next thing that i read was that john and myself are planning a holiday at capri please i would never go there for a holiday as it would be too tiring
5577301 the place of israel in the american jewish mind is not as central as it once was
5577302 the idea of jews under threat around the world isnt the case anymore
5577303 if one goes to hear a french novelist does that instill a love of france
5577304 you see a different crowd for the jewish film festival compared to an reading
5577305 whether culture divorced of actual interactions can really mean that much
5577306 which study after study shows is the best indicator of later attachment to judaism
5577307 its a very heart wrenching situation that im in right now
5577308 this is what erodes buyer confidence its this type of information
5577309 those are broad numbers that you take into account but that doesnt mean your 250 000 house is down to 200 000 it means maybe an 800 000 house went down to 720 000
5577310 my goal is to save it but i cant afford that type of a house payment
5577311 we are going to need according to statistics over 100 000 new properties because thats how many new jobs are going to be created over the next three years
5577312 maybe what you ought to do is come out of this conference with is a proposal to have the national government and investors all over america say help us make the first completely self sufficient energy state in the u s i promise if you do it it would rock the world
5577313 the sun shines here all the time the wind blows much of the time and were one of the few states that has massive amounts of geothermal energy thats why i refer to nevada as the saudi arabia of renewable energy
5577314 i ran the risk of boring you today because i do this work and these details are important they really matter and therefore if you really care about it you need to master as many of them as you can
5577315 all we have to do in washington is give tax credits to renewables weve given huge gifts over the years to fossil fuel to nuclear why not to renewables and it will create million of jobs
5577316 the reality is when it comes down to jews on the street they are not necessarily in sync with these organizations
5577317 yes they were very upset yes they were mad but in the end they could do nothing about it
5577318 they need lieberman at this point much more than lieberman needs them
5577319 the civil rights movement or the vietnam of the jewish community
5577320 when you look at it demographically many of these people are not part of the jewish community
5577321 encompasses politics it encompasses american jewry international jewry literature and identity
5577322 with the exception of chabad what has the american jewish community done for those who have chosen
5577323 if youre looking for a time when all jews in america will again be speaking yiddish as their vernacular tongue
5577324 it is with great joy we announce the formal transfer of the brighton creek conference center in mckenna washington from the spiritual assembly of pierce co cd 3 to the national spiritual assembly
5577325 i have no idea why a person would ever leave an accident scene like this knowing you hit somebody
5577326 you have to have some regard inside of youself to stay and check the people out i was left by myself on the road so i know
5577327 i remember crawling on the ground looking for nancy i remember grabbing my ear i looked at my hand and it was full of blood
5577328 it gives you goose bumps to see her do that well and when they announce it and raise the flag
5577329 it just gives me the idea that maybe some day if i had enough motivation that even i could do it
5577330 i dont think you can do anything or move on unless you form a relationship with your horse
5577331 its a large organization that touches a lot of people
5577332 when we talk about how to make a good society a moral society
5577333 very often it comes down to the details judaism recognized that a long time ago
5577334 nuts and bolts of what a candidate intends to do
5577335 no woman no romance no heroism and not much action
5577336 democrats can lose republicans can lose and anyone who can predict the outcome today is just plain wrong
5577337 we must give obama and we must give the younger generation the opportunity to do what the baby boomers have done which is to mistreat america as well and do as good a job as we could have of protecting the future for our children because we have failed
5577338 what will the jewish people look like down the road
5577339 its now become increasingly clear that intermarriage is a fact of life in american jewish life thats not going to go away
5577340 one day youre jewish and the next day youre vegetarian
5577341 the most interesting place where this plays out is in russia
5577342 the power of chabad basically boils down to the power of niceness
5577343 cast politics as being a competition between the faithless and the faithful and that really turned a lot of people off in the jewish community
5577344 lieberman never ran an ad saying jewish leader and i dont think it would have played if he had
5577345 a lot of people ate the goat stew the next day
5577346 a living lens photographs of jewish life from the pages of the forward
5577347 in den flugh fen diesen tempeln von zivilisation und technik herrschen in wirklichkeit die gesetze des dschungels
5577348 eine berm chtige soldateska macht sich im wege der erpressung sonst k nnen sie nicht mitfliegen an ihrem intimbereich zu schaffen durchleuchtet und durchw hlt ihre taschen betastet ihren k rper und befummelt ihre g rtelschnalle
5577349 we will miss these players and thank them for their efforts over the past years as valuable and enthusiastic members of the revolution squad we wish them well in their recoveries and hope that they will get the chance to represent the usa again
5577350 if we score one boundary in each over we will have scored 200 runs in 50 balls in the remaining 250 balls we need to score 160 runs which is a fairly easy job
5577351 arrey sachin paaji woh to bhagwaan hain oh sahin he is god himself
5577352 a tribute to my idol the little master sachin ramesh tendulkar
5577353 the managing directors composure and complexion has raced and radiated over several shades and shards of red and radioactivity
5577354 its not that youre having tons of students unable to attain refinancing they just have to hunt around for another lender
5577355 its certainly something that were very very concerned about and watching very closely
5577356 it was more intimidating before i did it and then once i sat down and looked at it i realized how simple it was
5577357 they were pretty good about letting us know what lenders they werent using anymore
5577358 they wouldnt do it without me getting a co signer
5577359 it was going to be a very big problem for us
5577360 receive the benefit of a government guarantee and the congress worked to ensure that these lenders could continue to operate under the current economic stress
5577361 have an obligation to serve students of all types including those students who attend two year community colleges
5577362 resume providing educational loans to qualified students at all schools we had previously notified we would no longer be lending to
5577363 at penn state more than 90 percent of our borrowers lost their federal loan lenders since spring after many banks and private lenders left the loan business
5577364 we knew we had to do something to guarantee the stability of federal loan funds for our students and parents
5577365 yeah we dont like to see old people kissing yuck
5577366 i hung out with gangsters and i drank i loved booze
5577367 i know a lot of kids would consider sleeping and doing other things on a sunday morning
5577368 but its important for me to continue my jewish education
5577369 ill call the deputy mayor for public health next summer ill put you right in the morgue
5577370 that would pay for your housing and meals and you wouldnt have so much debt
5577371 then go to your schools foundations division on their web site theres often scholarship money that doesnt get distributed because students dont want to take the time to write the essays or do the paperwork
5577372 felici che mons georg ratzinger abbia accettato la cittadinanza onoraria
5577373 ecco la gioia che non si pu taroccare parola di papa benedetto
5577374 davanti al triste spettacolo di tanta falsa gioia e di tanto angosciato dolore nel mondo dobbiamo imparare da maria a diventare segni di speranza
5577375 per me benedetto xvi un secondo padre con lui si ragiona ma sempre con allegria
5577376 unless the country is protected dharma cannot be protected and unless dharma is protected the country cannot be protected
5577377 she pretends to be a communist socialist secularist to hoodwink gullible hindus but at heart like any other muslim she is a hard core islamist
5577378 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy
5577379 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan
5577380 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir
5577381 the pipes still work when the pipes work theres nothing like it
5577382 there are people who are targeting online bank accounts on a regular basis but not to the point where its going to cause me to stop using it
5577383 its a technical and trademark distinction but i should think someone in his position would at least be aware of it
5577384 and i think as with any business if they dont offer a service that is attractive they will cease to exist its a competitive environment
5577385 many people just dont have the level of knowledge needed to safeguard themselves
5577386 to get away from earning a living by the hour
5577387 of the seinfeld episode where george gets his results negative and screams negative
5577388 compare the technology political social world we live in today and you realize quickly none of us are born in to the world we live in
5577389 antirational junk thought has gained social respectability in the united states during the past half century
5577390 it has proved resistant to the vast expansion of scientific knowledge that has taken place during the same period
5577391 then nobly give to the whole world this discovery which could contribute so much to the progress of art and science
5577392 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
5577393 you spoke so beautifully you have to make this a reality otherwise it will remain a speech
5577394 i get to shift economies its extremely liberating i breathe differently
5577395 its never a full implementation it is easier to dream than to do
5577396 in america and australia it has to be outside the car
5577397 she pulls in then shes squeezing between two cars to drag out this big cable and walk it back to her car shell be wearing her nice work clothes and getting them dirty
5577398 weve just lost half the market you need to make life simple for people
5577399 but at the end what you want is a snowflake
5577400 what do we need to make this happen two servos two degrees of movement for the arm
5577401 this is the driver experience he goes into a spot and the spot connects itself in 2008 we put the cable in the unit in 2010 we use an arm in 2012 theres a smart arm that connects automatically for the home unit the users get a pull cable for free or they pay 500 and they get autoconnect itll cost 250 to build and well sell it for 500
5577402 by the time hes thought of something to him its been completed its been achieved
5577403 the other trait is that by the time youve understood what hes thinking hes already somewhere else youre in catch up mode 24 7
5577404 in order to bring about this dramatic change sometimes we need a boy like in the fairy tales to say look the emperor has no clothes we can all see that for ourselves so how come we havent said so and this boy comes along and puts things in motion to bring about change and the boy in this story and he really is a boy practically but he has achieved more than many adults have is of course shai agassi
5577405 when you want a fish you get a woman and when you want a woman you get a fish
5577406 he had the self image of being an equal to steve jobs or michael dell or bill gates
5577407 even if this ends up destroying for lack of a better word my refinery business that will be small money compared to what this will be when you play chess you give up something to get something else
5577408 we wouldnt have invested if we thought this was a onetime one place story
5577409 you dont have the normal car problem where you need first gear to get off the line we just took the original transmission and stuck it permanently in second
5577410 when you take your foot off the pedal the car has kinetic energy
5577411 the motor starts charging the battery turning the kinetic energy back to electric energy
5577412 if youre regening it means you used too much energy in the first place
5577413 ah you are not a computer its not like you can calculate how much energy you need to get to that red light
5577414 every time you do regen theres a not like you get it all back
5577415 the perfect driver would cruise around without ever using regen or the brakes when they came to their destination they would coast to a stop
5577416 zero percent tax on our cars dong as a partner
5577417 but there was already 0 percent tax on alternative energy cars in denmark
5577418 ill be offering 20 000 cars in a market where youre selling 60 000 cars how many have you planned to sell in 2011 in denmark because i recommend you take them off your plan
5577419 i have a strong feeling this is where the industry is going to go
5577420 we are not aware of any reason why automakers would not sign up for this
5577421 i have so many sins to pay on my climate bill right now that we hope this works really fast
5577422 we separated the ownership of the car and the ownership of the battery see car companies dont know how to assess the life of the battery so they go through these complicated programs of testing them for a long period of time and we told the car company you know what just like you dont sell a car with a card that says here is oil for the life of the car you dont sell cars with the batteries for the life of the car because the battery is crude oil
5577423 if we also buy clean generation we reduce the price of clean electrons so that at the end of 10 years clean electrons are cheaper than coal based electrons and nobody builds another coal plant at that point thats another 40 percent of co 2 emissions thats the treaty tony blair is now working to get for the world by 2050 im telling you we can get there a decade after we finish the car side we can get there in 2030 60 percent reduction in our co 2 emissions
5577424 i joke that 29 days a month shais my boss and one day a month
5577425 will transfer 2 trillion to 3 trillion out of the economy
5577426 we dont make batteries so arent we going to swap out foreign oil dependence for foreign battery reliance
5577427 all you need is a plug right why would you need an infrastructure
5577428 my proposal was about health care or something in san francisco
5577429 this is the irony the city is working harder to get their business than the business itself shouldnt he be sucking up to san francisco
5577430 our mission is to break the worlds oil addiction before it breaks us
5577431 were not its not us to them its them to us you see people want this to happen we just happen to be in the way of their getting what they want we cant give them the car fast enough thats something we need to capture were here to serve you not were here to sell to you were a facilitator not the creator this is going to be a community we just need to get out of their way theyre going to push for policy theyre going to sell the cars theyre going to be zealots
5577432 he tells you the story and it sounds so simple why dont we have it today why isnt it here already
5577433 what were trying to do is create a space where a person with a curiosity can walk in and satisfy that curiosity

5577466 it can be very difficult for juries to follow what has happened
5577467 what if a jury cannot reach an 11 1 majority decision the way is now cleared to allow 10 2 or nine to three verdicts
5577468 a majority verdict weakens the whole basis of what a jury is supposed to do reach unanimous agreement on guilt or innocence
5577469 the stunning image quality produced by amoleds has never been in question however there is continuing debate over when the amoled will become a commercially viable technology in the display industry and how effectively it will be able to compete against the current industry heavyweight thin film transistor liquid crystal displays tft lcds
5577470 regardless of this debate the amoled market is set for strong growth over the next few years although volume shipments will be tiny compared to tft lcds
5577471 while mobile handsets are the obvious main target for the technology these phones require multiple sources of suppliers with sufficient volumes to meet demand its unlikely that a single company will be able to fulfill this demand in the short term because no supplier presently has sufficient capacity
5577472 if amoled makers want to stave off tft lcds advance in this arena they must continue to press their advantage on these fronts

5577482 lunico che ebbe il coraggio di chiedere scusa per aver firmato il famigerato appello contro il commissario calabresi fu paolo mieli
5577483 di altri intellettuali dellepoca che firmarono contro calabresi e hanno chiesto scusa non risulta nessuno si preferisce far finta di niente e non svegliare il can che dorme ha continuato il direttore di libero del resto il clima di quegli anni lo conosciamo ed ha perfettamente ragione claudio martelli che qui a cortina ha detto che il seme della violenza era insito nel 68 stesso
5577484 scalfari bobbio e tutti i cosiddetti intellettuali dellepoca condividevano quel clima di violenza e firmavano tutti quei manifesti come quello contro calabresi ha detto feltri ma oggi si tende a voler dimenticare quegli anni a voler cambiare le carte in tavola

5577486 la sinistra per rivincere deve presentare un democristiano come prodi se presenta uno di sinistra come rutelli o veltroni perde
5577487 napolitano ha proseguito il direttore di libero scrisse su rinascita che lunione sovietica aveva fatto bene a togliere la cittadinanza a solgenitsin perch era un elemento pericoloso per il paese cos come non si ricorda una presa di posizione dellattuale presidente della repubblica a favore degli ungheresi nel 1956

5577495 john edwards presidential aspirant and author of the famed claim that there are two americas was apparently only faithful to his wife in one of them apparently he didnt realize that the national enquirer had reporters stationed in the other america where he was in fact banging his videographer
5577496 i thought this was nice at one point during the olympic ceremony tonight they had 56 children march in all belonging to john edwards
5577497 while after vigorously denying reports of his extramarital affair and calling the story ridiculous untrue and tabloid trash john edwards today admitted he had an affair and the national enquirer was the only publication writing about it the national enquirer was the first to break it turns out it was true you know what this means elvis is alive bigfoot is real aliens are here its all true
5577498 i guess edwards apparently met this woman at a new york city bar in 2006 and he is a pretty smooth operator
5577499 no he actually said today about the other woman he doesnt love her oh thats smart now youve got two women mad at you great way to go
5577500 you know what it turns out she was his campaign videographer yeah there you go think therell be a sex tape coming soon huh
5577501 well democrats are furious theyre going on record now saying john edwards will not be allowed to speak at the convention because of this affair yeah instead speaking in his place bill clinton you have to put your foot down

5577513 a lot of our exports go actually to america both commodity export but even more importantly our services they import and these have slackened
5577514 there are some indications clear indications that the american growth slack would hit india too and you know our growth rate has come down a bit and we have to see how much further it comes down
5577515 on the other hand we are not thoroughly dependent on it we should try to see what we can do to overcome that
5577516 i have never been a crystal gazer well i think it goes away in less than two or three years i will be very surprised if it goes on for more than four five years
5577517 if you want to make democracy work you have to make sure that not only the government but the opposition also concentrates on identified major issues
5577518 the growth is a non thought growth is not a formula
5577519 so the issue of democracy is quite central to issue of growth
5577520 this puts a lot of money in government hand so the question is what its priority should be
5577521 all these relate to each other this is one way of increasing the sharing of growth the other way is growth generates income in fact it generates more than proportionate income for the public sector for the government revenue

5577579 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up

5577584 the general mood of frugality hitting us shoppers as they cut back on spending during the downturn has yet to extend to the most popular electronics goods which are seeing continuing robust demand some electronics retailers are even taking advantage of the belt tightening trend to lift sales
5577585 in spite of the country being apparently on the brink of recession overall demand for gadgets saw consumer electronics sales up an annualised 4 8 per cent in july according to us government estimates
5577586 sales of furniture and home furnishings declined by the same amount while clothing sales managed a mere 0 9 per cent rise

5577639 it appears that many scooter riders dont understand that their scooters are motor vehicles under arkansas law and are subject to the same traffic laws
5577640 as a prime example scooters may only be legally driven on the street not on sidewalks plazas lawns or for that matter inside buildings university police officers will be enforcing these laws and writing tickets when we see a violation
5577641 to park a scooter on campus owners are going to need a university of arkansas scooter parking permit and scooters may only be parked in designated scooter parking areas on campus

5577683 if we were to win we would have to be perfect
5577684 im a little disappointed knowing that i tied the us gymnast said monday night after chinas he kexin won the olympic gold medal on uneven bars on the second tiebreaker after they had tied to the thousandth 16 725
5577685 i had the same exact score thats what made it a little harder to take
5577686 scoring is scoring and thats our sport said the 18 year old liukin after she had been given the silver medal in her best event based on her having a higher average deduction 966 to 933 from the middle three judges
5577687 thats what weve been going through our whole lives and we just have to accept that
5577688 one judge liked her better than me liukin said with a shrug
5577689 its been going around for so many days weeks and months now liukin said
5577690 economic growth has been sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices and weaker growth in exports
5577691 global financial markets remain unstable and there are downside risks to the world economy particularly the us economy
5577692 while growth will likely remain sluggish for the time being it is expected to return gradually onto a moderate growth path as commodity prices level out and overseas economies move out of their deceleration phase
5577693 is expected to be somewhat higher over the coming months but to moderate gradually thereafter thus it is likely that the economy will return onto a sustainable growth path with price stability

5577700 organisations are switching from company owned hardware and software assets to per use service based models this will impact the industry in various ways
5577701 the projected shift to cloud computing for example will result in dramatic growth in it products in some areas and in significant reductions in others in general assets will be used with greater efficiency and we are assuming the overall effect on market growth will be neutral we also recognise that there is considerable upside potential for higher growth
5577702 most companies updated their software systems during the period 1997 through 2001 so we are in the middle of an upgrade cycle that should extend past the end of this decade
5577703 however the replacement of systems does not automatically equate to new software market growth software as a service saas cloud computing service oriented architecture soa web 2 0 and open source software are causing huge changes to the software market many of these factors are impacting market growth as enterprises replace assets with per use services
5577704 legacy telecom services have a dampening effect on sector growth and therefore on the overall it market

5577727 then after that we heard shouts and screams so we obviously put it down to a crash
5577728 when i got to the scene there was a bus overturned it looked like it had ploughed into a car and then down a neighbours driveway into the garden
5577729 it must have dropped about 20ft it was on a slope its diagonal not head first
5577730 there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus there were many walking wounded all being seen to by the ambulance staff

5577818 remember that fuzzy static between channels on the old tvs
5577819 today more than three quarters of those radio airwaves or white space spectrum are completely unused
5577820 so we took it upon ourselves to take advantage of that and go get it ourselves
5577821 white space opens that up it drops the cost of end user equipment it increases the ability of us to broadcast to not have intermediate repeating towers to support going through a grove of trees

5577830 i dont resent luis ayalas decision to request a trade out of dc what competitive player in the later stages of their career wouldnt want the chance to compete for baseballs romanticized ultimate prize in fact if you thought the nationals tv audience of 9 000 daily viewers was impossibly low id hate to imagine how low those numbers have dipped as the nationals have dropped 81 of 125 and the viewers have probably left because they can by turning off the tv though they still go to games at nationals park so when ayala saw the opportunity to bolt he requested a trade with the mets already expressing interest and it would seem there was no reason not to unload ayala who has underperformed to a team that no one in baseball wants to see succeed while simultaneously pleasing a steadfast skipper nationals manager manny acta who was familiar with and fond of the player soon to be named later anderson hernandez when both he and acta were with the mets

5577838 represents another big giveaway to oil companies already making billions in profits
5577839 president bush and john mccain are not serious about addressing gas prices if they were they would stop offering the same old ideas meant to pad the pockets of big oil and work with democrats to reduce our dependence on oil invest in the renewable energy sources crack down on excessive speculation and stand up to countries colluding to shake down american consumers

5577855 during the second half to june jet fuel in particular broke more records than the australian swimming team mr godfrey said
5577856 we are strongly of the view that ret is very likely to result in abatement that is at higher costs than would otherwise be necessary to meet our emissions reductions targets the groups chief executive heather ridout said
5577857 i want to make very clear that the renewable energy target was a very clear election commitment to the australian people by the rudd labor government and its a commitment we will be meeting senator wong said in sydney
5577858 we believe it is important for the government to provide incentives to the market to invest in renewable energy so that future generations of australians have a range of clean energy options available to them she said
5577859 we remain committed to ensuring that 20 per cent of australias energy comes from renewable sources by 2020
5577860 we put out a consultation paper last month and we look forward to continuing to consult with the industries about the shape of that renewable energy target she said

5577862 hogans legal arguments are unsupported by case authority and without merit
5577863 here as the party challenging the summonses hogan has the heavy burden of rebutting the governments good faith showing
5577864 he has failed to carry that burden with naked arguments and bald assertions without evidence in support of such allegations are insufficient to rebut a prima facie case for summons enforcement
5577865 first hogan is wrong because the summonses do not seek tax returns
5577866 second hogan is wrong because resident status is not the test for whether an investigation is unnecessary
5577867 i cant describe it in words its just not possible to me
5577868 its as simple as that my son underwent an operation and the only reason he managed to get that treatment is because i am earning money i have no choice
5577869 i have total respect for her i dont know how she does it she really is amazing in our eyes im really glad she medaled
5577870 the only thing we were doing was to catch up and its really tough in one day games if you lose too many wickets upfront
5577871 the module is known as self preservation self protection and self determination whereby the scope of teaching will cover individual and family values and understanding of physical and emotional changes that each person undergoes
5577872 it was important to turn the page and move on which i did
5577873 i photographed these turkeys in a south berkeley ca neighborhood about a mile south of the uc campus they were just sauntering down the sidewalk as if they were out for an afternoon stroll they turned the corner and walked up the next block following the sidewalk seemingly unconcerned by my presence but i didnt push my luck trying to get closer to them than 20 feet or so
5577874 we have a secret weapon we shall cease to be your enemy
5577875 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere
5577876 were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5577877 weve had a good run here the past few years
5577878 were fortunate to have a good feeder program and kids who come from a socioeconomic position that allows them to concentrate on developing their games
5577879 we did lose all three of our singles players and i cant remember the last time that happened
5577880 the key for us is to have new singles players step up and to develop chemistry with our doubles teams early in the season we have our work cut out for us to knock kent off but we look forward to that challenge
5577881 stephen is our best player ever he didnt lose a match last year until the state tournament
5577882 were stronger overall as a team our kids are really eager and more than happy to get ready
5577883 i kind of warned all my friends that it might be kind of a defamation of the chinese flag or something
5577884 i know the chinese government is strict and unyielding so i kind of told them to leave those at home keep them a secret
5577885 boring it must have been to sit on the throne day after day
5577886 if you step on the mat and you dont think youre going to win theres no way youre going to win
5577887 so im going out there to win im going to go out there to put points on people im going out there to beat them down
5577888 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5577889 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5577890 i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality
5577891 we had a supposedly closed scrimmage on saturday and some of our people brought in little blog sites that said we saw this and we saw that
5577892 our coaches work hard on what were trying to prepare and would rather not have their thoughts and ideas and game plans out there kicked around until they get to showcase them
5577893 some who come abuse the situation some people come and all of a sudden it becomes an ebay thing and the people who are here with their youngster who would just love to have a james laurinaitis signature kind of get nudged out of the way by the folks that are trying to use james signature for their own gain
5577894 when things get a little bit abused and out of control you have to control them
5577895 anytime that we have a chance to provide an opportunity for our fans to come in with no cost its as good a deal as it can possibly be
5577896 we hope that some folks who dont necessarily get here all the time because we know how hard it is to get tickets have a chance to come
5577897 in between the police strike force piccadilly and ourselves we basically made atms too hard a target and not a profitable target to attack mr gould said
5577898 weve had a number of them attacked and the thieves have abandoned their attack quite quickly once theyve realised theyve been beaten
5577899 when the problem was occurring the clients wanted to have it not too public until they got some of them out in the field and started defeating these ram raiders mr gould said
5577900 and if no one is listening then it is because they dont want to hear because this is a referendum people dont need anyone to represent them they are representing themselves as somebody who has followed peoples movements and who has been in rallies and at the heart or the edge of things i dont think you can dispute what you see here
5577901 since the 1930s there have been debates and disputes about who has the right to represent the kashmiri people whether it was hari singh or sheikh abdullah or someone else and the debate continues till today whether it is the hurriyat or some other party
5577902 india needs azadi from kashmir as much as kashmir needs azadi from india
5577903 look son apologies to feminists here ill allow you to indulge in your delinquent behaviour in about two years from now when you are sixteen so why dont we make a deal and you have your freedom unquestioned and unfettered two years from now if you just exercise a little more self control now
5577904 no solution to the kashmir issue other than merger with pakistan

5577925 he left our prison early this morning and he is now already far from here
5577926 he has served his sentence and the authorities in vietnam will deport him he does not have any sentence to serve in london if he wants to stop wherever he wants to he can do that
5577927 the only problem is the countries he wants to go to because he has to get a visa
5577928 we would like to let you all know about the departure of 2 members from the seduction joey jones and founding member daniel
5577929 when threatening situations turn into reality in conflict regions we need to take an in depth look at what really happened what forces were used and how they were deployed
5577930 we are in a completely different situation than sweden which is now considering change the swedes havent built up their defence forces in many years
5577931 does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it
5577932 its not important to be the best its important to represent your heart

5577939 its caption however that not a single one of the 10 000 kitchen computers advertised in the 1969 neiman marcus catalog was ever sold partly because the interface was apparently so user unfriendly
5577940 the situation is moving in a positive manner the tension is now being cooled down
5577941 the situation has improved quite a lot in regards to the standoff between the militaries from both sides
5577942 the tension around the area has been eased we hope very much that the situation will go back to normal as soon as possible
5577943 not that i expect socialists to respect property but still
5577944 wir legen wert auf die expertise der mitarbeiter das bedeutet nicht dass die besch ftigten ber die kapitalbindung entscheiden sie haben ein mitbestimmungsrecht aber kein stimmrecht
5577945 jedes unternehmen mit mitarbeiter kapitalbeteiligung schafft praktisch sein eigenes modell ausgerichtet auf die jeweiligen ziele
5577946 etwa 2 4 millionen beteiligte mitarbeiter gibt es schon jetzt in deutschland die h lfte davon sind bereits aktion re
5577947 materielle mitarbeiterbeteiligung geht immer einher mit einer immateriellen beteiligung und einer flexiblen arbeitsorganisation wenn sie erfolgreich sein will
5577948 diese form beteiligt die mitarbeiter unb rokratisch und direkt am aufschwung ohne jegliche verpflichtungen wenn es konjunkturell wieder schlechter l uft
5577949 rund 85 prozent aller unternehmen die ihre besch ftigten am gewinn beteiligen tun dies um sie zu motivieren
5577950 erfolgsbeteiligung ist nur die erste stufe die allerdings durch steuern und sozialabgaben zum teil wieder weggenommen wird

5577952 sacrifice is difficult but if you start out with the small things in life we can learn and get better at it day by day what can you sacrifice for our lord this week
5577953 let us be one with jesus let us make our life a continual sacrifice a martyrdom of love to console jesus may all moments of our life be for him alone we have only one task during the night of our present life to love jesus
5577954 americans regard democracy as something more transcendent something more sacred than just counting noses
5577955 americans at base want to know that their politics is about what is right and if a majority wants to do what is wrong people just dont roll over

5577964 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5577965 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5577966 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5577967 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
5577968 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again
5577969 the concierge found the property for me with just a click of a mouse there it is they also found the mortgage company they found my lease option tenant they did all the work and we were able to close in our own living room
5577970 until the last minute he was in two minds facing a choice between fight and flight
5577971 some of these things become self fulfilling prophecies because market confidence is so fragile
5577972 were certainly poised and ready when market conditions are appropriate
5577973 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5577974 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5577975 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5577976 were in the one of part of the entertainment business that just continues to show tremendous growth in the international market in particular

5577979 this has been the most difficult bargaining process we have ever experienced
5577980 its been a bumpy road for more than a year largely because there were sutter wide implications to the unions proposals
5577981 touch sight does not have an lcd but instead has a lightweight flexible braille display sheet which displays a 3d image by embossing the surface allowing the user to touch their photo
5577982 the degree and depth of whats happening in the financial industry is beyond anything weve seen in decades and it takes time to get your arms around the severity of whats happening and what the long term and short term ramifications are

5578001 both expectations and memories are more than mere images founded on previous experience
5578002 why is it still up its been four days since the battle
5578003 but all in all its more important to actually catch death eaters right now
5578004 these are aurors williamson and greengrass and they will be the ones holding your investigation
5578005 so everything will run smoothly ill ask questions occasionally and stop the investigation when i see fit
5578006 i have authorised ms weasleys presence in this investigation williamson
5578007 into the events of the battle of hogwarts by harry james potter resident at number four privet drive little whinging surrey
5578008 you are registered as a resident there until you register differently as an adult
5578009 investigators kingsley shacklebolt minister for magic david aaron williamson head of the department of magical law enforcement alfred madden warner senior auror jordan aidan greengrass practicing auror
5578010 you are harry james potter of number four privet drive little whinging surrey
5578011 were you present at the battle of hogwarts of may second
5578012 dont get smart mr potter we are on your side do tell us what happened please
5578013 now potter tell us where have you been in the last year
5578014 you wanted to ask me about voldemorts downfall not about what i did right
5578015 fine potter lets start with how you got into hogwarts
5578016 would you mind take a little detour to my office harry
5578017 there are some things id like to discuss with you some things i would like to know not as the minister but as a member of the order and a friend
5578018 the administrator of nurmengard prison just sent in a note telling that he is willing to host prisoners for a while and that he will reinforce the prison with more guards for it
5578019 if abbey wasnt so eager to tell you this she might have noticed that he added a p s
5578020 he said that there will be a possibility that he will need reinforcement for the guards if the prison will be full
5578021 they know one of them will be promoted to senior undersecretary and the other will remain junior or move to another department thats why theyre so eager to please me
5578022 im keeping it there so we could investigate what it is when we have time
5578023 the department of potions and plant poisoning at st mungos is swamped with an amazing number of questionable potions and mutated plants the death eaters invented
5578024 we suspect snape helped them there he really was brilliant at potions
5578025 just before he died he gave me some of his memories he was on our side although he had to give some information to voldemort so it wouldnt look suspicious
5578026 he was a master at legilimency harry he could have given you false memories
5578027 he was dying he was barely capable of holding my hand let alone creating false memories
5578028 he knew he was seconds from dying why would he want to give me those memories that would assure me of all people that hes innocent
5578029 he wasnt one to care what others thought of him
5578030 what did he show you that made you so certain
5578031 i dont recall you being so fond of him nor the other way around
5578032 i just want to know what makes you say that so confidently
5578033 i cant imagine snape ever being kind to someone let alone love
5578034 i know that what you told us in the investigation wasnt the complete story but since i was at the battle i could see what really happened in the pensieve afterwards and i have some questions regarding to things you told voldemort
5578035 its only been a week cant you just hold it off
5578036 we need to move on from the battle and start rebuilding i dont want to focus on what happened but on what will happen
5578037 then why do you need harry to tell you all this
5578038 its just too much right now cant you just ask me some questions
5578039 if thats what you want i wont force you to do it harry i just want some questions answered
5578040 then ask me questions i dont want to see it again i want to move on
5578041 during the battle you said some things that made me wonder
5578042 ive heard of horcruxes before of course but it was so brief i had to look it up again
5578043 did voldemort make one is that what you searched for the last year
5578044 yes ron hermione and i destroyed four dumbledore one and neville one
5578045 what was that thing about the elder wand isnt that something from the tale of the three brothers
5578046 it is but im afraid that thats one thing best kept in silence and not be told
5578047 a few decades from now you wouldnt be able to remember all that itd be a good idea to store it somewhere other than your thick head
5578048 i was thinking maybe we should go to see teddy
5578049 he has served his sentence and the authorities in vietnam will deport him he does not have any sentence to serve in london if he wants to stop wherever he wants to he can do that

5578054 the mud hits chicago the murder rate in the city is up 18 percent over last year republicans and attack ads are trying to put the blame on barack obama we weigh the charges against his record
5578055 i think the american people will vote obama in because he is not yet the man that he is going to become and mccain is no longer the man that he once was
5578056 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon him
5578057 the biggest problem confronting the world today is the illusion that our differences matter more than our common humanity
5578058 other than telling us how to live think marry pray vote invest educate our children and now die i think the republicans have done a fine job of getting government out of our personal lives

5578121 theres no real consensus theres no candidate thatll make everybody happy
5578122 depending on where you are from and where your allegiance has been will help determine that
5578123 this has been a great privilege to work on behalf of the people of illinois for over 35 years
5578124 emil jones is a man with a big heart and a man of action he is a true champion of the people
5578125 he didnt just do the talk he did the walk all of us in illinois owe him a great debt of gratitude
5578126 first of all i have taken a county lake county and turned it from bright red to pale blue
5578127 i have probably added more democrats to the senate than anybody else ive shown my ability in that area
5578128 as your paper has reported i had no involvement in it this has nothing to do with me
5578129 genevas historic center is a source of pride to residents and an attractive walkable commercial district to visitors historic preservation has always played an important role in maintaining the citys authentic sense of place this discussion is critical in determining the future of historic preservation in geneva
5578130 more people than ever before in kendall and kane counties need help today
5578131 especially with so much state and federal funding being cut it is both important and gratifying when corporations such as caterpillar and its employees step up in this manner
5578132 we have too many hungry and homeless people in the fox valley too many kids at risk too many seniors needing assistance the dollars fox valley united way collects help ease a lot of hurt
5578133 i think everyone will admit that hes certainly put his heart and soul into it and had some really impressive results out of it
5578134 i feel good about the year and im very appreciative of the board for recognizing that
5578135 we are cubs fans an unofficial journal of baseballs best fans
5578136 to have a store like that in naperville support you is really incredible
5578137 i took a class in college and that inspired a passion for it
5578138 the amazing thing about living across the street from wrigley is whether theyre good or bad the ballpark is still filled
5578139 there are so many people who come day after day
5578140 but the overall theme of every cub fan is the hope the belief and the anticipation
5578141 one was that the entire layout and design is all my own
5578142 we were really able to portray what i wanted to show
5578143 we are cubs fans an unofficial journal of baseballs best fans
5578144 it is a big commitment and we do recognize that there are other sports out there
5578145 its a team sport and it develops hand eye coordination and develops confidence
5578146 we have an awesome banquet at years end that we hand out awards at we have certified coaches
5578147 its a little unbelievable that the kids would bowl a 300
5578148 i think we run one of the best youth leagues around we provide them some of the best coaching around
5578149 were working with our attorney about tightening up our ordinances to have people remove the stuff from their yards from the emerald ash borer the trees and the stumps
5578150 i agree 100 percent that a hazardous tree should come down
5578151 we have not exercised that authority for the emerald ash borer infestation to date all removed have been voluntary
5578152 early removal will if nothing else retard the rate at which they are ultimately going to have to reduce trees

5578157 this is too important to leave it up to bake sales and other fundraisers
5578158 we need to step up and find a stable funding mechanism
5578159 these extra funds will help us stay here and continue to provide these services
5578160 without it were looking at some serious financial concerns next year
5578161 its important that people who choose to participate in the criminal justice system fund this and not the law abiding citizens
5578162 weve been to that complex many many times and given enforcement notices and typically people comply
5578163 and sometimes the grills come back out after a couple of days
5578164 we can see both sides of the argument but in the end all grilling should be done in an open area away from buildings or underneath eaves
5578165 theres a saying that there are three kinds of people that cause fires men women and children
5578166 i have concerns about whats going to be said and im not going to call her
5578167 i was mad at the ex boyfriend we had an argument
5578168 the deal is contingent on her cooperating and testifying if she is called as a witness
5578169 she fully cooperated with them and did everything they asked
5578170 you have to understand the trauma the family was under
5578171 they were asleep in the middle of the night theyre terrified as you can imagine and bound and gagged it was extremely difficult
5578172 there were a lot of ways this could have gone badly we should all be thankful were not looking at a multiple homicide
5578173 they were at the scene for a very long time its a different kind of a crime scene than when a single person breaks in when no one is home is there for a few moments and leaves
5578174 the village has a long history of hunting down its perpetrators
5578175 the law is quite clear that they could have worded the question for any election and it automatically would then go to the next one
5578176 however they chose in wording this to say next election and clearly the next election was february
5578177 i think it the suit is indicative of whats really going on in the village and that is we have a law firm that has created this thing and will do whatever is needed to protect it
5578178 we intend to follow the law and are going to protect our dissolution petition
5578179 we think the village had every right to defend its own existence but since these people stepped up there was no need to have the village involved
5578180 if were going to put this much money into our facility we dont want to just put a band aid on it
5578181 in terms of the immediate need our food pantries are seeing about a 20 percent increase in the amount of people going into them
5578182 this wednesday august 20 2008 the sundance channel will premiere
5578183 two years have passed since hurricane katrina hit the gulf coast and there is still an extraordinary amount of work to be done
5578184 this series provides a great opportunity for sundance channel to be part of the rebuilding process while presenting inspiring and compelling programming that spotlights sustainable design and the next generation of community planners
5578185 how does your design make better the life of someone who wants to live in the house
5578186 rather than stoke the ego of the architect who wants to express their nifty idea
5578187 begin by telling us how the final design was chosen
5578188 what do i need to tell this story to try and accurately capture it
5578189 it looks like terrorists dropped a bomb what are these kids thinking
5578190 using compressed air it takes only five minutes to inflate
5578191 comes complete with an altar an apse and a confessional
5578192 el juez ignor la cr tica situaci n de los vecinos de pacar pintado a quienes ni menciona en su fallo
5578193 ni siquiera menciona los reiterados incumplimientos de la empresa en particular las condiciones jam s cumplidas que se le exigieron por medio de la resoluci n n 140 para darle un apto ambiental condicionado en 2005 es una sentencia incogruente arbitraria y contradictoria
5578194 nuestra intenci n es que llevar a todos lados hasta setiembre porque despu s juan tiene que protagonizar otello
5578195 de producirse una suba buscaremos que no afecte a los usuarios con consumos menores de 300 kilovatios
5578196 edet pide una actualizaci n en funci n del ndice de precios mayoristas del ndice de precios de la construcci n del valor del d lar y de las subas salariales
5578197 estas modificaciones tienen que ver con una pol tica educativa que aspira a responder a las exigencias de una sociedad mucho m s compleja heterog nea y distinta a aquella en la que se form la mayor a de los docentes tucumanos
5578198 adem s de estos lineamientos nacionales cada provincia formular sus propios ejes de formaci n en funci n de la regi n de las caracter sticas culturales y de las necesidades territoriales
5578199 necesitamos las experiencias reales de aquellos maestros que est n al frente del aula y que conocen las fortalezas y debilidades del sistema
5578200 no s si todos los docentes cuentan con las aptitudes y la formaci n para ense ar a los ni os que est n comenzando la etapa de la escolaridad son preguntas que surgen no s lo desde este ministerio sino de la propia pr ctica docente y esto es muy importante ya que lo que un chico recibe durante los primeros a os de escuela o lo que deja de aprender en esa poca es un saber o una carencia con los que va cargar durante el resto de su vida por eso vamos a insistir en este punto
5578201 fui un chivo expiatorio para atentar contra el poder judicial
5578202 el excesivo ritualismo del que hizo gala la sentencia tucumana al omitir el tratamiento de las cuestiones constitucionales planteadas de indudable competencia para el tribunal de provincia choca frontalmente con el deber de asegurar la administraci n de justicia
5578203 las dilaciones a la que conducir a el sometimiento de la cuesti n planteada a las v as procesales ordinarias frente a las contundentes y concretas impugnaciones efectuadas por la recurrente dejar an en la indefinici n el ejercicio de tan trascendentes funciones las que cumpl a como jueza durante un tiempo prolongado quedando interrumpido el funcionamiento regular de las instituciones cuyo goce efectivo garantiza el gobierno federal
5578204 adem s de ser una alegr a personal y familiar es un triunfo de la justicia argentina cargu sobre mi espalda una cuesti n totalmente pol tica y arbitraria algo in dito en los anales de la jurisprudencia mundial fue un desgaste muy grande pero como siempre confi en la justicia a la que dediqu toda mi vida no fue en vano jam s permitir que nada ni nadie empa e en lo m s m nimo lo mejor que me legaron mis mayores los principios la conducta y el nombre que llevo con orgullo
5578205 siempre cre que nunca deb an haberme destituido porque se invent una causa para atentar contra el poder judicial s lo fui un chivo expiatorio porque podr a haber sido esta u otra causa para cumplir con el plan de desprestigiar a la justicia
5578206 tengo gratos recuerdos de esa etapa de mi carrera fue el club que me dio la oportunidad de jugar en primera pero todos saben que siempre fui hincha de san mart n
5578207 no s qu sensaci n sentir cuando enfrente a argentinos porque guardo muchos y lindos recuerdos adem s de que fue el club que me dio la oportunidad de jugar en primera pero los que me conocen saben de que soy confeso hincha de san mart n y como jugador de este club si me toca jugar el domingo har todo lo que pueda para conseguir el triunfo
5578208 es un gran halago en lo personal haber tenido la chance de jugar junto a un futbolista de la trayectoria del uruguayo espero que esta situaci n que s lo se dio por unos pocos minutos pueda repetirse
5578209 the question is can we be doing other things with that money
5578210 but my fear is were going to have to go to the well again and again and again for other stuff for the village and we will
5578211 no one is indispensable and the roof of city hall did not and will not collapse
5578212 when you put a grill on the back deck have it on the far side away from home instead of up next to the house
5578213 theres a lot of excitement in that school because theres going to be quite a transformation
5578214 it is my belief many of them are getting a pass when it comes to sensitivity training and psychological evaluations
5578215 batavia is postured that when the u s economy comes roaring back were going to be in a real strong position here to do some great things
5578216 youre putting a 50 foot wide home on a 60 foot wide lot
5578217 all youre going to see is a sea of rooftops because the houses are so close together
5578218 this isnt a research based decision its a budget based one
5578219 pulling our aides is opening the door for the district to keep taking from this successful program
5578220 as we were looking through our budget processes and staffing reviews we saw that this did not meet the standard of a 27 to 1 student teacher ratio for bilingual programs
5578221 mr cortez was our helper teacher and now his job is gone he helped us with many things with math and with the birthday parties i miss him every day
5578222 we made a decision to enroll our kids in this school to drive seven miles each way just for this program i wont see it dismantled
5578223 to state how much i regret that we are in the midst of this controversy we should have explained to parents teachers and principal what we intended to do before the school year and in writing with a full explanation of our decision and process
5578224 in between the police strike force piccadilly and ourselves we basically made atms too hard a target and not a profitable target to attack mr gould said
5578225 weve had a number of them attacked and the thieves have abandoned their attack quite quickly once theyve realised theyve been beaten
5578226 when the problem was occurring the clients wanted to have it not too public until they got some of them out in the field and started defeating these ram raiders mr gould said
5578227 pacific blue and virgin blue we expect those to be profitable chief executive brett godfrey said
5578228 the current fuel prices have swamped the industry greater than sars sudden acute respiratory syndrome which broke out in 2002 and 9 11 combined
5578229 during the second half to june jet fuel in particular broke more records than the australian swimming team mr godfrey said
5578230 we are strongly of the view that ret is very likely to result in abatement that is at higher costs than would otherwise be necessary to meet our emissions reductions targets the groups chief executive heather ridout said
5578231 i want to make very clear that the renewable energy target was a very clear election commitment to the australian people by the rudd labor government and its a commitment we will be meeting senator wong said in sydney
5578232 we believe it is important for the government to provide incentives to the market to invest in renewable energy so that future generations of australians have a range of clean energy options available to them she said
5578233 we remain committed to ensuring that 20 per cent of australias energy comes from renewable sources by 2020
5578234 we put out a consultation paper last month and we look forward to continuing to consult with the industries about the shape of that renewable energy target she said
5578235 unfortunately the labor party cant even agree to dig uranium out of the ground and sell it to the rest of the world he said
5578236 weve had the labor party and prime minister kevin rudd for some ridiculously stupid reason refusing to sell uranium to india to help its domestic nuclear power industry
5578237 my view is we will need both sides of politics thats the labor the liberal and national parties to jointly support the development of a nuclear power industry
5578238 we need more rational discussion about nuclear power in australia and much less of the emotive political debate weve had in the last few years
5578239 unfortunately the labor party can amp squo t even agree to dig uranium out of the ground and sell it to the rest of the world amp squo amp squo he said
5578240 hogans legal arguments are unsupported by case authority and without merit
5578241 here as the party challenging the summonses hogan has the heavy burden of rebutting the governments good faith showing
5578242 he has failed to carry that burden with naked arguments and bald assertions without evidence in support of such allegations are insufficient to rebut a prima facie case for summons enforcement
5578243 first hogan is wrong because the summonses do not seek tax returns
5578244 second hogan is wrong because resident status is not the test for whether an investigation is unnecessary
5578245 he is on his way to ho chi minh city
5578246 he doesnt want to go back to the uk because hes had so many troubles there already
5578247 he wanted to go to another country like singapore or hong kong
5578248 es un mentiroso pretende empa ar unas jornadas de las que participaron m s de 700 personas y en la que expusieron 30 disertantes pretende ensuciarlas pero no lo va a lograr
5578249 nos cont la due a del hotel que l se molest cuando le quisieron cobrar la mora por haber desocupado la habitaci n a las 18 no la pag y maltrat a la hija de ella luego fuimos nosotros y pagamos todas las facturas

5578349 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against the rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5578350 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5578351 however my difficulty is that it doesnt countenance aforementioned that whatever grouping poverty to heal in my experience healers are nearly ever the narrowing in recruiting and they defect discover the fastest then the crowning worker guilds enlist healers from the modify worker guilds and that effectuation the modify worker guilds hit modify harder instance production up newborn healers the base fact is that the sort of healers blizzard wants to equilibrise around exclusive does not correct the sort of players selection to heal that contributes to the disequilibrium of raiding and makes it harder for grouping to actually raid

5578363 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5578364 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5578365 its a huge challenge and they cannot face it individually its very important for them to work together and i think they know that
5578366 america wants some immediate decisions on fighting terrorism and i dont think they will be able to concentrate on that

5578375 while growth will likely remain sluggish for the time being it is expected to return gradually onto a moderate growth path as commodity prices level out and overseas economies move out of their deceleration phase
5578376 is expected to be somewhat higher over the coming months but to moderate gradually thereafter thus it is likely that the economy will return onto a sustainable growth path with price stability

5578433 its an ancient concept in judaism that the spiritual and the physical are united that to win a war you need both spirit and strength
5578434 you need people fighting but you also need people learning and praying
5578435 this sounds funny to the western ear what can a man learning in a yeshiva all day possibly give back to the world
5578436 torah learning that we do is the hidden code of the physical existence of all mankind and if for one single second there is no torah learning in the air all the world would go back to chaos

5578448 it is of great assistance to the new zealand economy and we would continue to work along that front

5578451 deferring the entry of sectors into the scheme could damage the credibility of the ets both domestically and abroad as the delay could be seen as a back down on a meaningful response to climate change and could lead to a question of the governments commitment to the scheme

5578456 these include letting the water settle in a pond so a lot of the eggs from worms drop out of the water and irrigating around the crops rather than on top of them
5578457 when the crop is harvested it also needs to be washed with fresh clean water in the market and that water needs to be constantly changed so everything else is not contaminated
5578458 i saw a lady running and came outside and she said theyre killing each over there

5578463 even while i was incarcerated i had ordered a lot of books about getting into the music industry books by kashif and donald passman i just sort of researched and wrote out my own plan as to what i wanted to do and how i wanted to get started
5578464 i really feel that even though i didnt do that actual crime back then i was still out there doing a lot of wrong so i believe that if that had not actually happened i would have been in an even worse situation but going to prison is what led me to do different things to find my true calling

5578467 breach of these provisions in the pensions act is a criminal offence it is for this reason that we take such a serious view of your story

5578487 it was frustrating for us to hear a number of different people arguing that school districts were issuing empty diplomas and just graduating kids who were not prepared
5578488 if there are local assessments that are not adequate for a variety of reasons we can agree on we ought to be talking about that
5578489 for the longest period of time it was assumed that if the child put the seat time in and sat through the course they would learn

5578508 fight for your opinions but do not believe that they contain the whole truth or the only truth
5578509 the recipe for perpetual ignorance is be satisfied with your opinions and content with your knowledge
5578510 the important thing is this to be able at any moment to sacrifice what we are for what we could become

5578537 today carousel mall hosted its latest public suicide there have ben several people who have jumped to their death from the upper levels at the mall in syracuse ny i have been fortunate enough to have not witnessed any of these events firsthand though today was almost the first after a day of preparing for classes that begin next week at syracuse university i was on my way home with the area construction i found myself on a detour near the mall so i stopped into the post office in the mall at about 6 15 or 6 30 pm down the corridor and one level below me was the end of a journey that began 21 years ago and 6 stories above that journey ended minutes before i walked into the mall what disturbs me more than the public suicide is the limited media coverage this event is receiving most coverage is in the form of user comments on the story at syracuse com though the credibility of these sources is weak at best i know there is evidence that reporting of suicide through media outlets leads to increased suicide rates and for that reason these stories fail to make it past the gatekeeper at the newspaper tv station i feel that todays tragedy offers cnn the opportunity to shed some light on public suicide and suicide prevention carousel mall is not the only mall to witness these events as the mall of america has had several as well this is an issue readers worldwide need to be exposed to it is also an opportunity to showcase the organizations like to write love on her arms www twloha com that use music and musician to put people in contact with trained professionals i urge you to follow this story thank you for reading and thank you for caring

5578545 every team you play can beat you and sweep you or take two out of three
5578546 we dont come to the ballpark anytime thinking this is going to be an easy week its just not like that
5578547 teams that arent in the running can give you fits
5578548 because theyre coming out relaxed just playing their game the pressure is on us to keep doing what weve been doing
5578549 if you start worrying about things in the future things that are ahead of you then you wont take care of the things that you need to take care of for right now
5578550 weve put ourselves in a wonderful position and this isnt something that were going to let slip out of our hands
5578551 for just as through the disobedience of the one man adam the many were made sinners so also through the obedience of the one man jesus christ the many will be made righteous

5578555 whoever is there is there and well figure out the rest
5578556 thats it dont ask me why richard richards the pitcher tomorrow and hopefully this time he does better
5578557 to be honest when i come to the ballpark i dont ask about joe crede
5578558 i ask about injured relief pitcher scott linebrink if he was able to do everything im not going to say credes out of my mind but hes out of my picture its not only joe thats the way i go about my stuff ive got 25 problems i dont need 26
5578559 pitching coach don cooper said he threw the ball a little bit better he had a better outing

5578564 i told the brethren that the book of mormon was the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of our religion and a man would get nearer to god by abiding by its precepts than by any other book
5578565 everybody knows beneath your clothes staring at your toes is just a pose everybody good knows how hard you blow everybody knows
5578566 this was significant in that there was semtex used it didnt go off but there was semtex there
5578567 where it has come from i do not know it is similar to devices used in the province during the troubles by other groups but when it passed over to dissident groups how it came to be in their possession i dont know at this point in time
5578568 tough action is called for now to eliminate these groups who are clearly developing their capacity and technical ability to wage such attacks
5578569 the police should be given the resources and the support they need to take the fight to the dissident republican micro groups who i believe are held in widespread contempt on both sides of our community
5578570 those who carried out this attack have nothing to offer they have little support and their actions will not advance irish unity one bit
5578571 sinn f in has a strategy for irish unity and we will not be deflected by these activities
5578572 many within the republican nationalist community wonder just whose agenda these groups are operating to
5578573 im not responsible for decommissioning and i dont know where the weaponry has come from but for me it looks as if it came from old stock from an old type of device which we have seen before in the province many years ago
5578574 how and when it transferred hands i do not know i believe it is semtex which came into the province around the time the ira got their supply of semtex but how it transferred to this grouping i do not know
5578575 we knew that they had access to weaponry due to the passing across of personnel so i am not surprised that they have access to it
5578576 as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex
5578577 with the current interdependant state of the world economy no country could either afford to wage a wide scale war nor would it be in their interests to do so
5578578 poland is a legitimate nuclear target if it installs the missle defense shield
5578579 i dont know what kind of weapons will be used in the third world war assuming there will be a third world war but i can tell you what the fourth world war will be fought with stone clubs
5578580 i do not believe that civilization will be wiped out in a war fought with the atomic bomb

5578584 algorithms for information retrieval are central to search engines such as google and baidu
5578585 baidu reached ipo status on the stock exchange on a friday evening and i sent him a congratulatory e mail message the following saturday
5578586 i expected he would be deluged with people contacting him during the first 24 hours of baidu going public i was thrilled to receive a response from him within an hour where he attributed his success to his studies conducted at cedar
5578587 in between the police strike force piccadilly and ourselves we basically made atms too hard a target and not a profitable target to attack mr gould said
5578588 weve had a number of them attacked and the thieves have abandoned their attack quite quickly once theyve realised theyve been beaten
5578589 when the problem was occurring the clients wanted to have it not too public until they got some of them out in the field and started defeating these ram raiders mr gould said
5578590 disturbing facts and figures that illustrate the consequences of having no access to sanitation
5578591 but it is worth noting that very many people are still not familiar with the statistics or even aware that there is a global sanitation crisis
5578592 these people use a fancy toilet which is connected to an effective sewer system and they are probably unaware that this toilet and its flushing system are critical to a healthy life
5578593 the year is not over yet but i would like to take a look at what the iys has achieved so far
5578594 if we are to reach the target we now need to provide at least 173 million people per year with access to improved sanitation
5578595 when i visited ethiopia earlier this year i learned that 1 3 million latrines had been built within 18 months in the countrys southern nations province
5578596 unsgab will continue to call a spade a spade or perhaps i should say a toilet a toilet and ladies and gentlemen i hope i can inspire you to do the same
5578597 is the iys 2008 making enough impact on the ground will our activities lead to sustainable improvements
5578598 in other words how many more people are gaining access to improved sanitation facilities how many have already paid a visit to the toilet how many now experience improved sanitation as a basic facility
5578599 we are strongly of the view that ret is very likely to result in abatement that is at higher costs than would otherwise be necessary to meet our emissions reductions targets the groups chief executive heather ridout said
5578600 i want to make very clear that the renewable energy target was a very clear election commitment to the australian people by the rudd labor government and its a commitment we will be meeting senator wong said in sydney
5578601 we believe it is important for the government to provide incentives to the market to invest in renewable energy so that future generations of australians have a range of clean energy options available to them she said
5578602 we remain committed to ensuring that 20 per cent of australias energy comes from renewable sources by 2020

5578609 i miei studi precedenti spiega dimostravano che la simmetria non era propriamente laspetto pi rilevante dellessere attraente ora per con questi dati pi precisi possiamo affermare che ci sono delle relazioni tra forma del corpo e attrazione le proporzioni la forma la statura sono segnali che comunicano allaltro un buono sviluppo fisico e buone condizioni di salute in molte specie la simmetria associata a sviluppo salute e successo nella riproduzione

5578613 we remain committed to ensuring that 20 per cent of australias energy comes from renewable sources by 2020
5578614 we put out a consultation paper last month and we look forward to continuing to consult with the industries about the shape of that renewable energy target she said
5578615 well guess we just have to accept the fact tr

5578624 as this conflict continues both sides of the war we need to realize that the red cross volunteers are in the area to help everyone whether they are families or fighters from the government side or the milf
5578625 i am therefore appealing to the military and the milf to respect the actions of the red cross and allow it to fulfill its humanitarian mission

5578673 although i am an investor in sugar holding some of sugar stocks in my portfolio for quite sometime but from a trading perspective in a very short term infact day trading is advised since the gyrations are all to frequent and unless and until you see balrampur chini moving above rs 93 and sustaining there this upmove you cant see set much store in it so i would say that if you are a nimble fingered keyboard operator doing your trades yourself better ignore sugar

5578713 nagarjuna fertilisers has a resistance at rs 43 and rnrl would be at rs 97 so suppose if the market rebounce a bit more and then the rebound tapers off then you can take a short position in these two but i would prefer reliance petroleum than rnrl because reliance petroleum seems to be showing more weakness another test of rs 145 appears quite likely
5578714 i t would be the biggest mistake of his life if he goes on the mound hoping to show the rangers something thats high school stuff
5578715 hindalco looks pretty weak the way it has broken yesterday suggests far more downside maybe it would be testing something like an rs 122 to about rs 120 so put a stoploss above rs 133 and take a short position there the initial target would be rs 125 then rs 122 and finally rs 120 is a major support

5578804 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived

5578806 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback

5578815 bears are generally carnivorous or omnivorous and then you have pandas they have gone in a completely different direction they are committed vegetarians
5578816 early on in the evolutionary history of pandas they must have invaded this bamboo niche and begun to eat bamboo
5578817 given the food source they were eating was very prevalent then they must have become more and more specialized it probably has been exploiting this kind of environment for many millions of years
5578818 someone qualified should turn this into an op ed piece to counteract all the propaganda being put out by right wingers to discredit carson
5578819 no thanks i already own a hundred acres of ocean front property at the top of mount everest

5578825 it is disturbing if not ominous to read comments about state rep sally kern that show hate and intolerance for her point of view what it does let us know is that out nations world view is shifting from a biblical judeo christian world view to a humanistic if not paganistic world view partially thanks to a century old effort in the government education system

5578828 he has provided her with a pittance compared to what the clintons have given obama her debt could have been cleared within 10 days its ungracious
5578829 im going to cast my ballot for her and then the moment i cast my vote im going to continue to enthusiastically support sen obama its going to be a good release for all of us many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
5578830 mr biden the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee clearly fell into the category of helping mr obama on foreign policy while mr kaine is a relative newcomer to national politics and would reinforce the notion of change both mr kaine and mr bayh would help mr obama in a state that democrats are trying to put in play

5578844 columbus and mercedes discussed compatibility issues between columbus ranger and mercedes vehicle computers mercedes executives received detailed specifications of the ranger and examined a customized ranger demo covering the stuttgart region prepared specifically for mercedes i am pleased to state that mercedes was impressed with our product and asked columbus to address several additional issues to facilitate the integration of the ranger in mercedes vehicles we agreed to meet again to promote this issue further
5578845 leading auto manufactures such as mercedes benz are looking for navigation solutions for the in car pc system fitted in each new vehicle our product ranger clearly meets this need for an off road navigation solution particularly for truck and 4x4 cross country vehicle drivers
5578846 these contacts with mercedes benz are a critical element of our strategy to establish ranger as the leading off road navigation solution integrated in new vehicles we are optimistic following the initial trial results and look forward to working with mercedes benz as well as other leading global auto manufacturers
5578847 its a good opportunity to learn what other jurisdictions are doing and about statewide issues that impact us

5578851 it is absolutely outrageous to see this kind of funding and this type of research within the uc system
5578852 the fact that a piece of research is funded by the tobacco industry and their singular issue is how to sell cigarettes taints the results of whatever the findings might be
5578853 teresa its pointless to try to point out anything to the animal liberationists
5578854 but we certainly understand the anti cruelty motive which animated his actions etc etc etc
5578855 we kill them because they have been damaged and are un adoptable and too expensive to keep
5578856 once you understand this the ar people can be forced to defend the indefensible
5578857 dont you know what they do to those animals no but whatever it is its delicious
5578858 tell me something how many of the last 10 nobel prizes in physiology medicine required animals 9 10 the exception being the award to the guys who figured out mri although that was undoubtedly tested on animals before being widely applied to humans animals were not critical for its discovery
5578859 for my part i consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom of slavery and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of debate it is the only way we can hope to arrive at truth and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to god and country i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death
5578860 no your theological beliefs and the actions resulting thereof are not okay with the community

5578863 if you dont like coca cola the only way to argue your point is by starting your own soft drink company and taking over cokes market
5578864 if you dont like the iraq war run for president on an alternative to our present political system ill to talk to you once you get elected
5578865 the third is to keep taking shots at a commenter and caricaturing her position while effectively preventing her from defending herself
5578866 the fourth which i hoped i had preempted is to tell me to

5578869 but most of all i bet id strip down oconnor if he doesnt up the game ive seen so far
5578870 cranks overestimate their own knowledge and ability and underestimate that of acknowledged experts
5578871 to get that implemented in practice they have to begin by delivering a moral argument strong enough to establish animal rights legally
5578872 caffeine is a competitive adenosin receptor antagonist adenosin is a modulator of intracellular signalling that reduces cell excitability in the central nervous system cns adenosine inhibits the release of acetylcholine gamma aminobutyric acid gaba glutamate dopamine norepinoephrine and serotonin
5578873 less likely to have drug and alcohol problems in later life
5578874 constantly forcing their neural structures to reaccommodate external influences thats why
5578875 adhd is functional in such an environment but when placed in an environment without such a constant rush of stimuli we get bored fidgity etc
5578876 would you expect someone in pain to simply think it away
5578877 while the benefits of psychostimulant treatment for adhd are clear scientists are only beginning to explore how these medications help protect children with adhd against later drug abuse two possible explanations have been proposed one neurobiological and the other psychosocial stimulant medications might make drugs less desirable through direct neurobiological effects in the brain that reduce the pleasurable effect that drugs elicit a second explanation is that the medications may reduce childrens vulnerability by helping them act less impulsively perform better in school and relate better to others thereby reducing negative feelings and the likelihood of joining socially deviant peer groups psychosocial characteristics known to be risks for drug taking possibly both mechanisms contribute to reduced risk
5578878 many medical professionals have embraced in an effort to get people to accept the treatments they offer
5578879 do you walk into a room and forget what you were there for
5578880 many medical professionals have embraced in an effort to get people to accept the treatments they offer
5578881 if your child was just more discipled then hed be under control
5578882 youre completely evil to medicate the child without his consent
5578883 these are the effects of these medications on people with these symptoms
5578884 these are the test results on people before the medication was administered these are the test results after medication
5578885 were found to alter symptoms in a way we found useful
5578886 i can comfortably assert that 80 of the american parents i know who are medicating their children are doing so not in the best interests of the child
5578887 in no way did i mean to imply that they are the total set of american parents that i know
5578888 studies of ritalin usage show that between 5 and 15 percent of school age children are taking medication for the disorder
5578889 the symptoms you are giving us are consistent with a number of disorders with adhd the most likely among them
5578890 what studies you wish me to cite do you want ones showing that more families have two working parents today than 50 years ago
5578891 those things are imbalances theyre deficiencies and we do treat brain neurotransmitter deficiencies that way see parkinsons disease
5578892 oh youre depressed try this paxil for a week or two and see what happens
5578893 why should the truth or falsity of such claims be necessarily relevant to any questions of treatment
5578894 i think the reason people judge parents who give their kids pills for such things is because often times the parents initial answer is to just give them a pill its the american way just look at the amount of people on antidepression medication the way i figure we humans have been around for hundreds of thousands of years generally our brain is working
5578895 the use of medication is not something ive complained about you clearly havent understood a thing ive posted
5578896 the question is this of the children diagnosed with adhd how many have an inherent disability that accounts for their behavior and how many simply dont fit in well with the unnatural environmental patterns we want to impose on them
5578897 its important to remember that sitting still for hours at a time only became a part of our lives relatively recently for the vast majority of history and all of prehistory we spent most of our time moving around doing and attending to things office work is quite unnatural so is sitting at a desk
5578898 in many cases we have no clear grounds for deciding that various states are pathological or even maladaptive
5578899 did it really not occur to you that it might be possible to adjust the environment to fit the people and still accomplish things
5578900 by that reasoning gifted students who are too bored to function properly in normal classes have pathological intelligence

5578903 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5578904 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5578905 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5578906 he is one of very few people of the kanshi ram era who is with mayawati today others joined bsp later
5578907 he is 18 to 20 years younger to me is not from my family and he is from my chamar community what is he and where he stays i have given everything in the letter in the sealed envelope
5578908 add all this to the fact that he is the vice president of the bsp a post held by mayawati once
5578909 through bali ram he came in contact with kanshi ram
5578910 rajaram wanted to pursue further studies but joined the bsp full time on the advice of kanshi ram
5578911 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today

5578913 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
5578914 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
5578915 what has been allowed to us is much lower than what we had asked for this will definitely mean losses for the airport we have to take a call on how to fill the widening gap between our revenues and costs
5578916 however we had said that even with the rising costs we were fine with a levy of rs 600 but could not go lower than that

5578920 we hope that this test will serve to prompt off licences to tighten up their approach to underage alcohol sales especially as the gcse results will be coming out soon
5578921 we are continuing our training through the west suffolk lsps put a cork in it campaign and will be focusing on raising awareness amongst more off licences in september and october
5578922 the test was carried out on a level results day to see if local retailers would become complacent and assume that the children were over 18 and celebrating their exam results
5578923 retailers should always ask to see the customers id if there is any doubt about their age and even those who did receive their a level results could still be just 17 years old suffolk homes
5578924 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules

5578926 higher commission didnt always translate into more service or better results
5578927 paid commissions of 3 percent or less were just as happy with their brokers performance as those who paid 6 percent or more
5578928 more likely to say they had regrets about the selling process
5578929 anyone who tries anything like that will face a crushing response
5578930 we are witnessing the start of a withdrawal of troops today and into the night

5578932 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5578933 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5578934 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5578935 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5578936 were a poor people whose country has become a battlefield for the russians and the americans theyre both to blame

5579034 napoli sar a ridosso della champions nuovi arrivati sono di grande valore idea cigarini accantonata dal napoli
5579035 personalmente non ho trovato molte difficolt a farmi notare anni fa dagli addetti ai lavori ho mosso i primi passi in campania ma successivamente sono cresciuto in emilia con la reggiana quindi ho fatto il percorso inverso prima di approdare allavellino e successivamente al napoli
5579036 disputai delle buoni stagioni a reggio emilia e poi con la maglia dellavellino nellinverno del 1986 quando gli azzurri gi erano in testa al campionato fu pierpaolo marino a credere nelle mie potenzialit e insieme al ds italo allodi decisero di affidarmi le chiavi del centrocampo azzurro vinsi contemporaneamente due sfide lagguerritta concorrenza con barbas e junior ed anche il primo scudetto della storia del napoli la scelta della dirigenza partenopea risult assolutamente azzeccata visto che risultai in quei cinque mesi uno dei protagonisti assoluti dellinaspettata vittoria finale
5579037 ci sono moltissimi giocatori in italia che giocano attualmente nel ruolo che ricoprivo io una volta ammiro moltissimo i vari aquilani montolivo e cigarini ma se dovessi citare un giocatore che pi rispecchia il mio vecchio modo di interdire in mezzo al campo dire eugenio corini del torino che nonostante non sia pi giovanissimo dimostra sempre di essere un giocatore di qualit e il tipico centrocampista moderno bravissimo in cabina di regia e decisivo sui calci piazzati
5579038 la partita col vllaznia licona dellottimo lavoro svolto in questi anni da marino e de laurentiis finalmente ritorna limmagine nel mondo di un napoli vincente credo che questa stagione sia la giusta continuazione di una programmazione studiata nei minimi dettagli col passare degli anni ritengo che gli azzurri abbiano le potenzialit necessarie per ambire ad un piazzamento appena a ridosso della champions perch per logica se lo scorso anno lobiettivo era la decima piazza in questo campionato si deve ambire assolutamente a qualcosa di pi importante
5579039 finora sono arrivati giocatori importanti denis e maggio andranno a rinforzare lundici titolare che lo scorso anno gi ha fatto benissimo
5579040 semplicemente perch il napoli non lo ha richiesto con insistenza in questa fase di mercato come aveva fatto in precedenza nel mese di gennaio quando marino mise sul piatto del patron del parma ghirardi un grossa cifra per acquistara met cartellino del giocatore poi con la retrocessione dei ducali tutto cambiato luca una giovane con grandissime qualit e non poteva assolutamente disputare un campionato di purgatorio in b ha accettato lofferta atalantina perch stata la societ che pi ha creduto nelle sue potenzialit napoli era destinazione molto gradita bergamo sar la piazza della sua consacrazione
5579041 non ci sono segreti la qualit dei giocatori e la compatezza del gruppo sono fattori determinanti per arrivare fino in fondo ad una grande manifestazione poi ci vuole anche una buona dose di fortuna durante i sorteggi
5579042 quando penso a quella sera mi vengono in mente una serie di emozioni che difficilmente si possono esternare in poche parole quando vivi unesperienza cosiintensa tutta in un fiato ti accorgi solo dopo alcuni giorni della grande impresa che hai compiuto insieme ai tuoi compagni di squadra
5579043 nella stagione del trionfo purtroppo mi ritrovai per molto tempo fermo ai box i rapporti con la societ per questo motivo non erano proprio idilliaci decisero di puntare su altri calciatori e intanto il mio promotore pierpaolo marino aveva lasciato lincarico dirigenziale quindi valutando vari aspetti e saluzione migliore per la mia carriera decisi di distaccarmi dalla realt napoletana in un modo non troppo traumatico sposando il progetto torino
5579044 cristiano ronaldo attualmente il pi forte al mondo giocatore eccezionale imprevedibile bello da vedere ma allo stesso tempo anche molto concreto in poche parole unico

5579139 you put the wind he had in new york behind the 9 69 here and o k now we could be down in the 9 5s except that he shut down with 20 meters to go
5579140 so now im like o k is that in the 9 4s its mind boggling
5579141 it takes a while when youre that tall to actually get into the groove when youre coming from sitting down basically
5579142 i actually thought after 30 meters that asafa powell or even walter dix would be leading but they werent i called it all week whats going to end up happening if he jumps on them before 30 meters good night
5579143 an excellent start for him next to guys six seven eight inches shorter is not going to look great on tape
5579144 hes 21 years old and been really running 100 meters for four months
5579145 one fifty four is very fast especially for an 18 year old
5579146 im sure she will break the world record when shes 21 or 22 maybe she runs different a very very fast first lap
5579147 it shows in kenya we can do better it shows you are capable
5579148 i had no time to think the only thing i could do was run and run
5579149 you cant bring pikes back but this can hold those responsible accountable for their actions
5579150 there is a bounce back we expect the current years production to be almost equal to the 2006 07 crop at around 310 to 315 lakh bales
5579151 the uncontrolled price rise has stopped for now though mill buying is slow and production estimates encouraging we do not foresee a crash in cotton prices
5579152 imported cotton which used to quote 80 cents has slipped to 75 cents today
5579153 next year prices and margins should fall but with rising capacity coming we think we should be able to maintain our profitability
5579154 the meg spread should drop sharply in the second half after a saudi arabian plant which had an accident resumed operations
5579155 its a major victory for the new government but there is still a lot of uncertainty going forward
5579156 we have to prove these two things to show that we really are getting a free lunch
5579157 the main principle of industrial ecology is to try and use our waste products to produce something of value
5579158 were looking at dumping the whole dinner on top of them and seeing what happens
5579159 we are pleased to see that the mva based candidate tested in chennai was safe and showed promising initial immune responses we do not know whether these observed responses will ultimately translate into an effective vaccine that will help protect individuals from hiv infection but hope to learn more through further testing
5579160 india is playing a significant role in global aids vaccine discovery efforts given our strong medical and scientific capabilities there is a need for continued efforts for the creation of novel reliable mechanisms for long term research on aids vaccines and other new prevention technologies
5579161 consistent innovation in science despite setbacks has ensured the development of many effective prevention technologies the successful conduct of the trial in chennai re affirms the need for continued vaccine development initiatives where learnings from every effort will contribute to global advancement of the aids vaccine field
5579162 i just bought a toshiba d r410 a week ago it has something they call

5579171 i have about 3 products coming out in the next 6 12 months but nothing new past that on the design board since i have been so busy with the leipzig keyboard synth i have a few ideas of the type of synth analogue related product i might do next though it will never be anything radical synth analogue stuff as been around for 30 or so years so its all been covered all i can do really is re invent the wheel so to speak i specialise in monosynths modulars percussion and analogue sequencers i will not get involved with dsp digital circuits beyond midi and logic patch memories complex and expensive to implement or polysynths expensive to give you an idea of our design ethos if you want to share your thoughts let me know but please dont be offended if i dont reply since theres lots to do here but i will try and share my thoughts back where i can i will of course ignore any offensive emails theres always some opinionated bright spark out there maybe ill list some of the funnier ideas on this site and keep the best to myself some things i consider when thinking about new products do i have the technical skill to achieve the design will it be too complex or expensive to produce will anyone actually buy it also i have to like the idea i never design any product that i wont enjoy myself
5579172 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
5579173 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
5579174 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
5579175 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
5579176 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
5579177 i think you just have to keep doing the same kinds of things youve been doing
5579178 you cant try to make it bigger than it is its a good opportunity and hopefully i can perform well and we can perform well as a team i dont think you can try to make it more than it is
5579179 as a quarterback you have to understand that youre going to make some mistakes but you have to minimize them and you have to get over them
5579180 we took him off the 5 yard line and he took them 11 plays and i thought he was very efficient at moving the team
5579181 he had a throw that wed like to have back but again its a learning curve for matt
5579182 the positive is that when things went bad matt kept his head up
5579183 he was into the game the real sign is going to be how when he comes back and has the opportunity to play next week when his number gets called
5579184 im just glad theyre willing to let the past be the past and give him a chance i just hope that the cincinnati fans will give him the same type of chance
5579185 i just have to be smart and handle myself like a professional at all times
5579186 i dont think it would be productive for our football team
5579187 theres responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege its not a right
5579188 they kept on telling us to be quiet but i got such a fright that i jumped up and screamed for tommy
5579189 all i remember is tommy running into our room and then flashes as the guns were fired
5579190 when i asked him to phone the police he kept on saying that he had been shot and then he collapsed on the bed
5579191 i ran outside screaming for help it is all that i could do
5579192 tommy was our everything we loved him so much and we know that he loved us he saved us he gave his life for us
5579193 it looked like he beheaded him i just ran when i saw my friend fall
5579194 i saw the boy with the mask running towards us i wasnt scared because the boys sometimes played in masks
5579195 then he pulled out the sword but i thought it was a toy
5579196 i thought maybe if i could talk to him he would stay conscious but i was too late
5579197 he told us he was into satanism had an obsession with ninjas and joked about killing people all the time
5579198 we tried to talk to him and were going to tell someone about it but we never got there in time
5579199 they chweneyagae and mothusi had three previous written notices for disturbing the peace at parties
5579200 they again turned the music up i called the police and went with them to their flat
5579201 alfonsi said i must pay for his tyres i replied that his friends had done it
5579202 i rented the flat presley stayed with me as he is my friend and we work together he was not involved
5579203 i have two people who saw muuren doing it but when i confronted him he denied it
5579204 it bothered us sometimes but i dont interfere in other peoples business
5579205 something so incredible it could only have been enacted on this earth by safa
5579206 mphela was in extreme pain after suffering a freak injury before the game against supersport and our team doctor has now estimated he could be out of soccer for between six and seven weeks as a result of a badly torn thigh muscle the boy remains in severe pain and hardly able to walk
5579207 yet the safa appointed doctor says he is fit to play in an international fixture
5579208 because i cannot believe any doctor could come up with such a diagnosis mphela suffered severe internal bleeding and the entire incident constitutes a disgraceful insinuation on the credibility of sundowns
5579209 what in effect bafana are claiming is that we selected mphela to play against supersport allowed him to go onto the pitch and then withdrew one of our key players from a game that has an r8 million prize in the offing with a faked injury
5579210 width of the nose and the length of the face
5579211 in the standing sessions we have to stand still and smile for half an hour or more we also run about 1 000 metres every day for physical conditioning
5579212 we dont want it to happen again and disrupt service

5579215 when these guys are robbing these places are they carrying out big bags of stuffed rabbits
5579216 of course not theyve got cash they have to know theyre paying out
5579217 everyone else around is at risk when theres a robber
5579218 its in our neighborhood in a lot of towns thats not the case here theyre amid our homes
5579219 there are some people that are pretty doggone tired of that and i think they have a reason to be
5579220 i tell them as soon as you come in im going to bust you
5579221 now we have a government thats more open thats disposed to listening to our demands and thats beginning to generate some changes
5579222 the first one to jump to the gate in latin america in terms of providing rights to same sex couples
5579223 the nascent movement of lgbt rights in latin america is just flowering right now
5579224 there is no foreclosure at the moment theres a notice thats been posted i dont really have any other comments there should be no real changes for the residents
5579225 simply keeping a lid on 90210 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5579226 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
5579227 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
5579228 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
5579229 global market presence for ocz high performance power supplies continues to grow rapidly due to our ability to remain on the cutting edge of both efficiency and stability

5579233 weve got to make sure were doing all we can to make sure everyones prepared
5579234 i hope the world has woken up to what is going on the russians should get out of my country
5579235 the worst thing the world could do would be to compromise and show weakness
5579236 the russians will invent all kinds of excuses pretexts not to pull back their troops
5579237 they will rename themselves peacekeepers maintain their positions in the security zone

5579249 the value of the aircraft we provided was in excess of 190 million more than the budget for the film eon said theyd never dealt with a company whose products were worth more than their entire budget it took a lot of working out but we got there with just a few days before filming was due
5579250 typically we might be waiting around for three hours for seven seconds of filming
5579251 they were very careful with the aircraft although where necessary i had to explain a few things for instance they wanted to use some liquid to stop reflection from the fuselage and i just said no chance they were fine about it
5579252 we also really did invest time and care in making sure it was all safe especially one landing in panama at a place not used to our type of jets
5579253 we sent one of our senior captains andreas kollberg out there in advance and he came back with nearly 300 photographs and video of the runway he also assessed safety hazards which in this case included flocks of huge vultures with six feet wingspans

5579264 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5579265 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5579266 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5579267 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas

5579321 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5579322 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5579323 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5579324 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5579325 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5579326 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5579327 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5579328 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5579329 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5579330 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5579331 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5579332 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5579333 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5579334 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5579335 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5579336 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5579337 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5579338 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5579339 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5579340 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5579341 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5579342 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5579343 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5579344 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5579345 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5579346 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5579347 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

5579365 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5579366 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5579367 its apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain
5579368 the weight of evidence thats on the table now says that on a precautionary basis we should stop this practice fluoridation
5579369 no american or canadian child is or ever was fluoride deficient in fact the u s centers for disease control tells us that 1 3 of u s school children are fluoride overdosed causing dental fluorosis white spotted yellow brown and or pitted teeth its time to stop fluoridation
5579370 this new brain research together with the nrcs evidence of fluorides thyroid and bone damage and the cdcs recommendation against use of fluoridated water in infant formula as well as the national kidney foundations withdrawal of their fluoridation support makes a strong case for ending this 60 year old fluoridation experiment

5579375 sun screen is fine if you intend to spend many hours out at midday or at high altitude and it does reduce sun damage and aging however it is important to remember that humans evolved under the sun even pasty white northerners and that we need sun on our skin to be healthy sun disinfects our skin and it triggers the manufacture of vitamin d which is necessary for healthy bones and an effective immune system only people with genetic predeliction to melanoma should use sunscreen all the time and avoid the sun the rest of us should spend an hour a day in light shade or morning or evening sunshine preferably exercising if you must be out in strong sunlight use a hat or umbrella and cover up with lightweight high spf clothing avoid burning though a light tan on exposed skin is protective against melanoma

5579398 when only one nuclear bomb could destroy a city like minneapolis we dont need 6 000
5579399 senator mccain its time to get serious about reducing the nuclear threat
5579400 it uses the word bomb in an airport so its not real appropriate
5579401 its probably a little unsettling to people to see that in an airport environment particularly post 9 11
5579402 i just took a look and i can see how this would be offensive scary to some the concept of our city in the crosshairs of a nuclear bomb and the strong anti mccain message can we remove it
5579403 its just trying to draw attention to an issue thats an important one and we need to deal with it
5579404 and now northwest airlines is trying to play political censor and i dont think thats their role

5579475 bank sarasin is progressing well along its growth path our strategy along with the associated investments is geared to the long term by pushing ahead with the expansion of our locations and client advisor teams we are consistently pursuing our growth strategy and investing in the long term future of the sarasin group rather than simply trying to maximise our profits in the short term
5579476 for us there are two facets to the results reported for the first half of 2008 first our lower income and profit reflects the very challenging market environment at the same time we were able to build on last year s acquisition success improve our cost efficiency and push ahead with our growth initiatives especially the launch of bank zweiplus the expansion of our offices in switzerland as well as the obtaining of licenses in germany bahrain qatar and oman show that we are making good progress at all our locations we are well equipped for the future
5579477 our acquisition performance of chf 5 2 billion on the operating side is higher than our original expectations and the target we set ourselves thus we are building on last year s success
5579478 although these new advisors have already signed contracts with us
5579479 most of them will only start work in the final quarter of 2008 and will not therefore make a positive impact on revenues until 2009 onwards
5579480 at the same time we need to take action to improve our profitability
5579481 on the one hand the investments in initiatives to assure our long term success will start to bear fruit in the next few years and have a positive impact on our results on the other hand we have taken measures to further improve our cost efficiency such as the launch of bank zweiplus or improving the ratio between front and back office capacities we are well equipped for the future

5579499 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5579500 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5579501 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5579502 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5579503 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5579504 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5579505 we are strongly of the view that ret is very likely to result in abatement that is at higher costs than would otherwise be necessary to meet our emissions reductions targets the groups chief executive heather ridout said
5579506 i want to make very clear that the renewable energy target was a very clear election commitment to the australian people by the rudd labor government and its a commitment we will be meeting senator wong said in sydney
5579507 we believe it is important for the government to provide incentives to the market to invest in renewable energy so that future generations of australians have a range of clean energy options available to them she said
5579508 we remain committed to ensuring that 20 per cent of australias energy comes from renewable sources by 2020
5579509 we put out a consultation paper last month and we look forward to continuing to consult with the industries about the shape of that renewable energy target she said
5579510 there is now a concrete proposal with the turkish cypriot association which shows the progress that has been made
5579511 this process only started last september and these types of negotiations are not easy
5579512 with a view to improving relations between the football communities on the island of cyprus
5579513 this is an interim measure prior to a solution to the cyprus problem
5579514 to play in formal competitions you have to be a member of fifa the only way would be to join the greek cypriot league but we are not willing to do this therefore we would only be able to play friendly matches under this proposal
5579515 with a view to improving relations between the football communities on the island
5579516 the offer would allow turkish cypriot clubs to play friendlies against clubs from other countries but we are not talking about the setting up of a new national side
5579517 there are also two conditions attached firstly any clubs wanting to take up the offer would have to be affiliated to the official cypriot fa
5579518 secondly in accordance with our statutes the official fa would have to give its approval for these matches to go ahead
5579519 in order for any matches to be staged in the north the ctfa must sign a document whereby they recognise the cfa and agree to become members this must be done by september
5579520 not accommodated any request for a friendly match without our prior approval
5579521 but i dont didnt raise my kids that way then you are an exception ive been reading reports in business weekly psychology today and a ruters report on this subject just recently its not just my opinion here
5579522 one hour after they drank red bull their blood systems were no longer normal they were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease
5579523 after consuming the drink created in the 1980s by austrian entrepreneur dietrich mateschitz based on a similar thai energy drink formula 1 race cars and extreme sport events around the world but warns consumers not to drink more than two cans a day
5579524 if you have any predisposition to cardiovascular disease id think twice about drinking it
5579525 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5579526 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5579527 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5579528 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5579529 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5579530 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5579531 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5579532 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5579533 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5579534 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5579535 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5579536 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5579537 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5579538 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5579539 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5579540 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5579541 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5579542 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5579543 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5579544 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5579545 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5579546 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5579547 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5579548 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5579549 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5579550 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5579551 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5579552 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5579553 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5579554 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5579555 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5579556 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5579557 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5579558 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5579559 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5579560 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5579561 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5579562 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5579563 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5579564 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5579565 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5579566 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5579567 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5579568 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5579569 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5579570 there will be feasting and dancing in jerusalem next year im going to make through this year if it kills me
5579571 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
5579572 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5579573 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5579574 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5579575 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5579576 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5579577 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5579578 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5579579 you guys write about things happening in a weeks time thats why we dont like you baseball is a six month game
5579580 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5579581 after saying 10 years ago that he was in possession of the documents now during the permatang pauh by election he said he has surrendered them to me do you take him seriously
5579582 he is desperate to get the attention of umno leaders so i am not going to entertain him
5579583 in this by election umno still uses the polarisation tactic of different rhetorics for different communities
5579584 hi i think ive worked out how changes in the borgs command protocols can be routed through sub space without compromising their universal teleconnectivity
5579585 some may think that theyre homeowners insurance policy covers their collectibles but in most cases your homeowners policy is designed to cover personal property and is not nearly enough to protect your treasured collectibles
5579586 they may limit the collection to a percentage of the total value of your home limit the amount that they will pay for theft of valuable items like silver crystal guns stamps and paper documents or be based on actual cash value rather than the collectible or replacement value
5579587 normal homeowners policies dont generally deal with collectibles we write policies specifically for a persons collectibles whether it is a rare book collection stamps coins sports cards vinyl records and the many other collectibles that we deal with every day
5579588 we strongly encourage prospects from overvaluing their collections we cannot insure emotional worth but can insure a varying array of collectibles we ask that people have a paper trail save receipts for what they may have paid for items documentation is very helpful take video of the collection or pictures validation is an important element dont over insure and if necessary get a second opinion
5579589 price guides are great but they are just one of the tools used when trying to gauge a value of a collection
5579590 replacement value would be what a knowledgeable buyer would pay a knowledgeable seller for the items it is an agreed upon price between two knowledgeable individuals in a sales transaction you must price your collectibles realistically for insurance purposes
5579591 the valuation process could also be aided by a professional appraisal although that is not always necessary professional consensus price guide values what the collectibles may be selling for on the market at the specific time our own resources and expertise and because no two collections are the same all these factors are available in helping people determine what the value is we also have a number of resources on file and references listed on the website including valuation aides inventory aides and dealers to help people along so they can put a figure on the collections worth in which to write a policy
5579592 we provide reference to many entities in the process including obtaining information from the kovels com american stamp dealers association price miner antique trader beckett com cbgxtra com for comic book collections collect com goldmine publications military trader trains com and a number of other resources depending on the genre of the collectible
5579593 submitting a claim to them is much more difficult to do as the moving companies would require much more documentation to validate a claim if there were breakage or something else were to happen
5579594 again validating just how much the collectibles are worth is a key element in settling a claim
5579595 no appraisals are necessary you estimate the value of your collection and determine the amount of insurance we need a ballpark figure
5579596 although an inventory is not always required at the time of application to purchase insurance collectibles insurance services strongly recommends its customers maintain an inventory to streamline provide proof and expedite claims in the event of a loss
5579597 a collectibles policy is typically less costly than scheduling items on your homeowners insurance
5579598 the price of insurance should not deter a person from insuring their collections the items are priceless to the hobbyist or collector and you will find our rates are not overbearing and are cost efficient we cover everything from autographs to zippos or something in between
5579599 around 1 00 pm and way the fuxk out there

5579601 weve got two halfbacks with us and there are other players as well with us this time whove played in that position before the likes of matt giteau
5579602 i think in the first instance it probably wouldnt be a surprise to you that well look to experience
5579603 so im giving you an insight there that we dont normally do ive broken protocol there
5579604 experience is valuable but it comes down to how you use that
5579605 what previous experience in these sort of contests gives you is an insight but if you then dont use that to your best advantage then its not much value
5579606 they ran today and reported no ill effects on that so we just have to see how they go see how they respond to that work in particular tomorrow and just push on and take it as it comes
5579607 well consider our selection and that will pertain to the springboks
5579608 well look at what we believe will serve us best we havent made those decisions yet believe it or not so well have those discussions and well settle on a combination
5579609 the reality is you can only live in the moment and you can only deal with the challenges that youre presented with at any given point in time and weve got an opportunity coming this weekend and we are not thinking beyond that

5579644 but we are seeing a lot more interest from mid size and small companies in terms of leveraging india to control their costs
5579645 so we need to compensate by adding more customers growth is happening but not at the same level as in the past because they are tightening their budgets

5579732 amado bajarias debut collection of poems heralds a philippine poetics that chugs along with the rumble of the citys decrepit trains on the way to the gentle twittering of countryside aviaries inasmuch as the collections title pepsi tastes funny when its christmas eve and youre alone eating canned tuna is already a mouthful the poems here likewise thrive on a kilometric and crafty gathering of modern wit irony and understatement within these pages are haiku ish commentaries gonzo reprimands and lots of longing for missed pets in many places reminiscent of both bukowski and simic bajarias often surreal and sardonic lyric is wide awake and dilated forever poking and plucking at both the living and the inanimate the departed the poet takes his sweet time digging for leftover bones and loves in rambunctious urban landscapes and whenever he gets tired of the act there is always the great soda in his system insisting that the apartment door is always open and there are miles and miles to go before he sleeps
5579733 coach addazio put up a quote that said the strength is the pack and the pack is in the strength
5579734 its kind of an inside thing for the defense were trying to develop a face and a mentality you look at wolves they hunt in packs every time the offense goes against the ones the no 1 offense or the twos we all go out and the first thing we say is we hunt in packs were going out to hunt when the ball is in the air or crosses the line of scrimmage everyone is running to the ball
5579735 it was like we were separate units out there we were just never a defense
5579736 weve got a completely different attitude when were out there
5579737 every single person is taking pride in what theyre doing position groups are getting closer our d line is as close as ive ever seen it the same with the linebackers
5579738 its not like last year when the coaches had to push everyone to get to the ball on defense we pride ourselves on having all 11 people on that frame on the camera right around the ball weve all been picking it up even the big defensive tackles have been running
5579739 i just cant tell you how much of a nine day difference its been from last year
5579740 last year we went through a lot of ups and downs
5579741 we kind of went into a dark room we didnt know what to expect now we know what to expect now and we feel like weve got a lot of experience
5579742 chemistry its conversation and play were doing a lot of things out there that we didnt do last year when a guy makes a mistake were not down on him were not ignoring him either were telling him to get it going and stuff like that a lot of guys on defense last year hadnt played together were comfortable with each other now
5579743 one of our problems was there wasnt enough finger pointing
5579744 guys would ignore guys a guy would mess up and instead of a guy saying come on baby get going he would get ignored it left that guy to question himself because no one was saying anything to him
5579745 its a lot different now theres a lot of conversation going on if you go out there in our huddle all you here is talking its not bickering and stuff like that its positive reinforcement and thats what we need
5579746 we just feel like were going to be a lot better
5579747 we made a lot of mistakes last year and we watched and we learned from them
5579748 he brings us a guy at the top of the order who has had some success in the sec
5579749 he had a very good year last year and im looking for him to become one of the premier leadoff hitters in the country this year
5579750 when kids get to that point when they can go in another direction it makes you feel good that youve made a lasting impression that they do want to come back
5579751 id be lying if i said it wasnt a loss
5579752 but everyone in the country would say they are dealing with a loss that is significant
5579753 berpuasalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya hilal bulan syawal jika kalian terhalang awan maka sempurnakanlah syaban tiga puluh hari
5579754 janganlah kalian mendahului bulan ramadhan dengan puasa satu atau dua hari kecuali seseorang diantara kalian yang biasa berpuasa padanya dan janganlah kalian berpuasa sampai melihatnya hilal syawal jika ia hilal terhalang awan maka sempurnakanlah bilangan tiga puluh hari kemudian berbukalah iedul fithri dan satu bulan itu 29 hari
5579755 apabila datang bulan ramadhan amka berpuasalah 30 hari kecuali sebelum itu kalian melihat hilal
5579756 puasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya jika awan menghalangi kalian sempurnakanlah tiga puluh hari jika dua orang saksi mempersaksikan ruyah hilal maka berpuasalah dan berbukalah kalian karenanya
5579757 manusia sedang melihat lihat munculnya hilal aku beritahukan kepada nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bahwa aku melihatnya maka beliau berpuasa dan memerintahkan manusia untuk berpuasa
5579758 kuraib mengabarkan bahwa ummu fadll bintul harits mengutusnya kepada muawiyyah di syam
5579759 aku sampai di syam kemudian aku memenuhi keperluannya dan diumumkan tentang hilal ramadhan sedangkan aku masih berada di syam
5579760 para ulama berbeda pendapat tentang hal ini atas beberapa pendapat
5579761 keharusan ruyah bagi setiap negeri yang tidak samar atas mereka hilal
5579762 tidak harus sama jika berbeda dua arah yakni tinggi dan rendah yang menyebabkan salah satunya mudah melihat hilal dan yang lain sulit atau bagi setiap negeri mempunyai iklim hal ini diceritakan oleh al mahdi dalam al bahr dari imam yahya dan hadawiyah
5579763 orang orang yang menyatakan bahwa ruyah tidak digunakan bagi semuanya negeri negeri seperti kebanyakan pengikut pengikut madzhab syafii diantaranya mereka ada yang membatasi dengan jarak qashar shalat ada yang membatasi dengan perbedaan mathla seperti hijaz dengan syam iraq dengan khurasan kedua duanya lemah dhaif karena jarak qashar shalat tidak berkaitan dengan hilal apabila seseorang menyaksikan pada malam ke 30 bulan syaban di suatu tempat dekat maupun jauh maka wajib puasa demikian juga kalau menyaksikan hilal pada waktu siang menjelang maghrib maka harus imsak berpuasa untuk waktu yang tersisa sama saja baik satu iklim atau banyak iklim
5579764 apabila penduduk suatu negeri melihat hilal maka seluruh negeri harus mengikutinya
5579765 saya demi allah tidak mengetahui apa yang menghalangi sayyid sabiq sehingga dia memilih pendapat yang syadz ganjil ini dan enggan mengambil keumuman hadits yang shahih dan merupakan pendapat jumhur ulama sebagaimana yang dia sebutkan sendiri
5579766 puasa kalian adalah hari kalian berpuasa dan berbuka kalian iedul fithri adalah hari kalian berbuka tidak berpuasa dan adha kalian adalah hari kalian berkurban
5579767 sanadnya jayyid dan rawi rawinya semuanya tsiqah lihat silsilah al hadits as shahihah 1 440
5579768 sebagian ahlu ilmi ulama mentafsirkan hadits ini bahwa puasa dan iedul fithri bersama mayoritas manusia
5579769 dalam hadits itu terdapat dalil bahwa hari ied ditetapkan bersama manusia orang yang mengetahui hari ied dengan ruyah sendirian wajib baginya untuk mencocoki lainnya dan mengharuskan dia untuk mengikuti mereka didalam shalat iedul fithri dan iedul adha
5579770 dikatakan bahwa di dalam hadits itu terdapat bantahan terhadap orang yang mengatakan bahwa barangsiapa mengetahui terbitnya bulan dengan perkiraan hisab boleh baginya untuk berpuasa dan berbuka berbeda dengan orang yang tidak tahu juga dikatakan makna yang terkandung dalam hadits itu bahwa saksi satu orang apabila melihat hilal sedangkan hakim tidak menerima persaksiannya maka dia tidak boleh berpuasa sebagaimana manusia tidak berpuasa
5579771 yang jelas maknanya adalah bahwa perkara perkara ini bukan untuk perorangan tidak boleh bersendirian dalam hal itu perkaranya tetap diserahkan kepada imam dan jamaah atas dasar ini jika seseorang melihat hilal sedangkan imam menolak persaksiannya maka seharusnya tidak diakui dan wajib atasnya untuk mengikuti jamaah pada yang demikian itu
5579772 nahr adalah hari manusia menyembelih kurban dan iedul fithri adalah hari manusia berbuka
5579773 apa yang sudah menjadi ketetapan sebuah hukum tidak berbeda keadaannya pada orang yang diikuti dalam ruyah hilal sama saja dia seorang mujtahid yang benar atau salah atau melampaui batas tentang masalah apabila hilal tidak tampak dan tidak diumumkan padahal manusia sangat bersemangat mencarinya telah tersebut dalam as shahihah bahwa nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bersabda tentang para imam mereka para imam shalat bersama kalian jika mereka benar maka pahala bagi kalian dan mereka dan jika salah maka pahala bagi kalian dan dosa atas mereka
5579774 pendapat yang masyhur dalam madzhab imam ahmad adalah wajib puasa pada waktu itu
5579775 apabila kalian melihat hilal ramadhan maka puasalah dan apabila melihatnya hilal syawal maka berbukalah jika mendung atas kalian maka kira kirakanlah
5579776 barang siapa berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan maka dia sungguh telah bermaksiat kepada abul qasim shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
5579777 tidak berpuasa pada saat itu adalah madzhab imam ahmad imam ahmad juga mengatakan bahwa berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan adalah mendahului ramadhan dengan puasa satu hari sungguh nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam telah melarang hal itu yang masih diragukan adalah tentang wajibnya berpuasa pada hari itu padahal tidak wajib dilakukan bahkan yang disunnahkan adalah meninggalkannya kalau dikatakan boleh dua perkara maka sunnah untuk berbuka itu lebih utama
5579778 aku tidak mendapatkan dari ahmad bahwa beliau menegaskan wajibnya dan memerintahkannya maka janganlah pendapat diatas dinisbatkan kepadanya
5579779 tidak diragukan lagi bahwa para peneliti dari kalangan madzhab hambali dan selainnya berpendapat tentang tidak wajibnya berpuasa bahkan dimakruhkan atau diharamkan
5579780 ketahuilah bahwa hari yang diragukan adalah hari ke 30 dari bulan syaban apabila tidak terlihat hilal pada malam itu karena ada awan yang menghalangi atau selainnya bisa jadi saat itu bulan ramadhan atau syaban dan makna hadits ammar dan selainnya menunjukkan atas haramnya puasa pada saat itu
5579781 janganlah kalian dahului ramadhan dengan puasa satu atau dua hari kecuali orang yang biasa berpuasa bertepatan pada hari itu maka puasalah
5579782 barangsiapa berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan maka sungguh dia telah bermaksiat kepada abul qasim qasim shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
5579783 hadits diatas sebagai dalil bahwa shalat ied dilaksanakan hari kedua tatkala waktu ied diketahui dengan jelas sesuadah keluar habis waktu shalat

5579824 this communications can be an extremely exciting industry to pursue i have found that internal communications has the ability to really make a difference in many ways and when done well it can be the true leader and lead the change i encourage anyone in this industry to think of new ways of engagement and think of themselves not as simply writers or not as simply conduits but actually people who can be catalysts in and of themselves

5579828 dont go in and start creating your presentation with powerpoint
5579829 gone are the days when the media paid little attention to what happened inside the corporate world
5579830 generally in the past the media thrived on a diet of crime and politics but business was always left to the back of the paper but more and more the business world is now under scrutiny from the media
5579831 you can have a major development happening within a company but unless you get your internal communication right you could wake up with the problem of your staff are reading about major developments in their company in the morning newspaper rather than hearing it first from managers within their own company
5579832 this has great potential to help the green energy sector improve the accuracy of its data
5579833 we wanted a way to ensure our inner circle members can control their own entry into the club and also to give them total exclusivity
5579834 we take their biometric details when they join and assign them a number then all they have to do is simply touch a special panel and theyre in
5579835 from the demand weve had it seems that manchesters business community has been waiting for something like the inner circle
5579836 its very straightforward and offers a number of advantages for our customers its also eco friendly because it cuts down on paperwork and mistakes that can happen during the ordering process
5579837 the key factors stimulating this growth are increased affluence growing tourism rapidly expanding airline networks and new routes especially those of low cost carriers
5579838 the increase in business travel as a result of globalisation is providing a further boost to airport retailers
5579839 these deals prove that money is still available despite difficult market conditions and our relationship with the banks involved is a very strong and productive one
5579840 james fisher was a key target for our northern team given its solid financial performance and specialised sector focus this deal is a great example of barclays continued strong appetite to provide funding to quality businesses in the region and our commitment to helping those businesses achieve their growth aspirations
5579841 this deal once again demonstrates that despite the current economic climate we are able to support quality management teams
5579842 many of our target customers grew up home baking and now want to do something similar with their children
5579843 people have less money available and are spending more time at home they are also increasingly concerned about healthy eating and we use no artificial flavours or colourings
5579844 there are 85 people and five teams at brooklands some people would forget to reply and you could only see availability one week in advance getting 11 people to the same place at the same time on a saturday or sunday was a difficult job
5579845 we have players aged 13 to 75 and even our oldest player has embraced the new system
5579846 from the admin side it has speeded up the whole selection process and makes it easy to organise teams and matches online even for a technophobe like me
5579847 the website has also generated a lot of communication between the players those selected for a team can chat online about the upcoming game creating a great vibe and we can tell people about all our events

5579850 dont worry if you dont get the online casinos related name you want
5579851 there are plenty of alternatives including different extensions and hyphenated variations
5579852 this is good news for all those in the online casinos marketing business
5579853 and the fact that internet related marketing only diminishes in cost over time means that soon original domain name purchases will be dirt cheap
5579854 were getting all the gold we can find and turning it into diamonds
5579855 with the power of the search engines these days its not the end of the world if you dont get a glitzy domain name just seo your site to the best of your abilities and slowly but surely people will beging to remember your sites presence on the internet when making online casinos related buying decisions
5579856 weve heard of other businesses temporarily loosing their domain name to hackers
5579857 but after a couple days the name is recovered and doubly secured by the respective company at their domain name registar
5579858 one of the most amazing online casinos related sales we had was in last septembers auction
5579859 though the domain didnt go for much money bidding was very spirited with some 50 people getting in on the action in the end the online casinos domain went to a well established marketing firm who did not disclose their future plans for it
5579860 we got stuck with a co uk version of the domain we wanted
5579861 but we played it to our advantage by marketing heavily to those in the uk and beefing up local seo in great britain the results show for themselves we had record breaking profits last quarter
5579862 once top domains are registered their security protection and legacy becomes mission critical
5579863 this contract is fantastic news for the landlord and tenant team and bears testimony to the high level of service we have delivered to the co operative group since our relationship began
5579864 we look forward to developing this further over the coming years
5579865 the financial operations and business development team identified a need for document management and an opportunity to improve purchase invoice processing efficiency
5579866 after a competitive tender process and an extensive evaluation exercise the british library decided upon version ones dbarchive
5579867 my father said that if i didnt want to take over the company then he was going to get rid of it there was no pressure but it was an opportunity to join the family business
5579868 had i stayed in sailing i would have been working for someone else so i decided to swap the caribbean to work all hours in the concrete factory
5579869 at that time the factory was in production from 6am until midnight we had been looking at a number of ways to grow the business including acquisitions but couldnt find anything suitable the offer from ibstock was very attractive so we decided to sell the company
5579870 the family has been in business a long time and we really enjoy it also there is huge opportunity for growth at pmi health group and we have not ruled out acquisitions to bolster the commercial division
5579871 when i was running anderton concrete products liability insurance was the fifth largest expenditure and cost more than 150 000 a year however following improvements to health and safety we managed to massively reduce the bill and it is small and medium sized manufacturers like anderton concrete products which we are targeting in a move to help them reduce their insurance costs
5579872 it is a process that allows the steel oil and carbon to be extracted from used tyres which obviously has huge environmental benefits however it would take significant investment to get into production so i am currently mulling over my options
5579873 the current market is bizarrely working in manchesters favour because it has provided an excuse for occupiers to take the cost effective office space the city provides
5579874 i remain confident because in the last seven months we have completed half a dozen office lettings to banks inward investors and professionals and we have another 400 000 sq ft of potential lettings in the preliminary stages
5579875 i suppose we made a brave call at spinningfields and spent a lot of money and i hope that by early 2009 the capital markets will have returned to normality and it might as a result be possible to build our next two office buildings speculatively
5579876 weve been pleasantly surprised by the interest from potential occupiers in no 1 crown square much of it from leisure users so weve decided to broaden the use of that building away from offices and into retail
5579877 funding a speculative building is very difficult in todays market but if we need a pre let before we can proceed then i genuinely dont believe that this will be a challenge
5579878 besides interest rates will come in a bit and by early 2009 the debt market will be back to normality making it easier to fund speculative schemes
5579879 we have withdrawn entirely from the transaction our agents had been trying to contact him for several weeks without success
5579880 our green programme could well become a blueprint for other shopping malls to follow
5579881 what we are instigating addresses environmental concerns while ensuring the mall remains a very pleasant place to visit
5579882 another possible idea would be the use of bio degradable shopping bags instead of conventional plastic carrier bags
5579883 in the interview with the bbc the buddhist spiritual leader 73 said of the olympics opening ceremony
5579884 if an individual feel that is the best way to remind them is not to attend dont do it
5579885 if they feel to talk to meet with chinese leaders thats more effective then go there
5579886 from my part theres no differences so long as the meeting takes place
5579887 should take a more liberal way a more open way to look towards tibet
5579888 famous pacific shipping has has branch offices throughout china and has developed into a leading provider of international freight forwarding and nvocc services
5579889 all of our offices are strategically placed with direct connections to the main trading areas of the world we will continue developing our transport hubs throughout south east asia for the benefit of our customers
5579890 demand for mps service offering in australia and the asia pacific region has increased significantly over the past few years and the acquisition allows us a smooth entry to the market
5579891 we have already committed over 2 million us 3 73 million to expand our fleet and expect to spend twice that in the coming year
5579892 should have known that this was likely to result in an injury
5579893 james mirtle is good enough to challenge eric at off wing as the best hockey blogger out there

5579896 mirtle looks like the kind of guy who would like to take you out to a nice dinner and talk hockey to you all night long
5579897 james mirtle is battling off wing for the title of

5579913 over the years you and i have had many many conversations about your dads behavior and your feelings about him it has occurred to me that in the course of all these talks we have talked about everything concerning your dad that we can possibly talk about so ive decided that we are not ever going to talk about your dad again the only exception would be if he does something he has never done before like he spells your name wrong on your birthday card otherwise if you come to me wanting to talk about your dad and its same old same old im simply going to tell you that weve had that conversation before and i have nothing new to say and youre going to have to deal with it which is what youre eventually going to have to do anyway

5579924 ive got to tip my cap because it was a slider down and away ive looked at the video 100 times and ill probably see it 100 times when im not sleeping tonight he really helped himself out there its frustrating when something like that happens
5579925 it was a little awkward but i was just trying to get in scoring position
5579926 he can swing the bat a little bit i just wish i could have hit some home runs in front of him instead of making him run like that
5579927 and they got away the five runs is really unacceptable we cant let that happen there

5579968 i did not exploit ranbir deepika off screen chemistry its a team effort a captain needs help from every team member and not some of them
5579969 i am a tough taskmaster but fortunately i had actors who could understand and compliment me
5579970 its a story of a man named raj and the three different women who enter his life when he is 16 24 and 30
5579971 i needed someone who could play 16 and 30 at the same time so from the onset it was ranbir and i knew he is a good actor
5579972 he is the sinatra of our day hes who everyone wants to be
5579973 jay is one of the few rappers now that still gives me chills i listen to him and im sucked in
5579974 he adds value to the lives of his consumers just like any trusted brand where he is different than a typical brand is that he has an extreme amount of highly valuable influence he could easily stand on the merits of what he is famous for but he has shot to extreme levels of success due to his influence
5579975 what hes done has kind of mirrored what we want to do and where we think were going
5579976 roc a wear eighty mill in like eighteen months you could bullshit wit rap if you want
5579977 the ability to capitalize on his windfall music will always be the springboard that carter uses to leverage the jay z brand into future ventures
5579978 however you have to remember that back in the day it was kind of like that as well east coast people werent listening to gangster rap and crips in cali werent listening to de la soul then in the late 90s it all kind of merged into commercial versus underground
5579979 hipster hip hop is some of the only progressive music out at this point
5579980 when rocawear made its debut in the late 90s it was aligned with the sound of the era
5579981 new york rap was an unequaled force on the charts and flashy street tales were the order of the day the clothes had to match the music so from leather bomber jackets to oversized shirts and baggy jeans it was all about reflecting the style of the inner city
5579982 rocawear is adjusting to the evolution of the street wear market their upcoming fall holiday 2008 collection is cleaner less logo driven and geared towards a consumer who no longer feels the need to pay homage to a particular brand
5579983 the 25 and over hip hop crowd which is a large crowd now cant identify with other rappers from our youth because they never matured with their music
5579984 their music never matured music has matured and his image has matured along with his audience
5579985 there is nothing hot about a 45 year old rapper
5579986 i thought the rap battle between camron and jay z was really indicative of the generation gap
5579987 hip hop is famous for killing its idols kids are anti establishment now jay z is the establishment
5579988 the best investors understand when the return they want is no longer available in an investment the sale of the various brands by carter is impressive because he was able to cash out of investments arguably towards the end of the rapid growth period of each operation thus he is now able to roll his money into other ventures that i can only assume he sees similar or higher returns in cashing out is always a good idea when you find a buyer willing to pay the value you place on an item the boiler is always realizing that fair value
5579989 there was definitely a lot of money in that room
5579990 no one respects drug money it doesnt matter how much money you have
5579991 you can go into certain places and they wont respect you now jay z has turned that dirty money into money that everybody respects and i think the guy who goes to work and sits in a cubicle all day still has dreams of being wealthy and powerful he can identify more with jay z than with a t i or a shawty lo they talk about wealth and blowing it on things we wouldnt spend it on whereas jay z talks about ipos and money market accounts he is speaking our language
5579992 respect is not just limited to your boys its not just limited to your block you want universal respect and thats what jay z has now
5579993 carter employs a loss leader strategy even more fitting now that album sales have declined similar to how a company like nintendo sells wii consoles at a loss to stimulate the sale of video games which have a high profit margin carter releases music in order to sell more profitable lifestyle products such as concert tickets clothing and even laptops
5579994 but as time goes on i think they will be the ones trying to get in contact with us
5579995 i think i own a spoon and a coat hook
