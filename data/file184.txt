1840645 it looks like gas station tv doesnt want the american people to know about senator obamas plan to offer working families a 1 000 energy rebate that would be funded by a tax on oil company profits
1840646 they clearly took the initiative with that ad and they clearly created a buzz
1840647 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
1840648 i think that the paris and britney thing i think they got everything out of that they can get out of that
1840649 the ads replace the rallies as campaign events the ads become campaign events and are covered as such and this is really where the dialogue between the campaigns takes place
1840650 this is the sweet spot for the ads wars this sort of dead zone between nominations and conventions
1840651 the real thing here is its taking obama off message and more so its taking the media off message as well
1840652 just rewind about 10 days ago it was all obama all the time and now in just a short couple days john mccain has people talking about energy policy talking about obama as a celebrity and injecting paris hilton into the race
1840653 this race is still very much in obamas hands national polls are just notoriously unreliable in the summer
1840654 if you think that we can create a better future and we can have a more serious politics than we have right now one that focuses on solving our problems instead of on paris hilton and britney spears then i need you to vote for me

1840659 i cant get a feature of this iphone app work the result is im going to settle on an inferior approach app wont be as good fucking nda
1840660 the fucking nda is here to stay it has certainly crushed my enthusiasm for the platform big time
1840661 re the fucking nda its pretty clear that this is being done for competitive reasons at the cost of a lot of developer productivity
1840662 it started out as a joke on twitter with the iphone community
1840663 i figured i would get about 10 000 visitors a day and it would go away in about a week the site has been linked to and commented on twitter ever since
1840664 there is no legal way for developers to talk about they are developing
1840665 no way to post tutorials no way to give code away its hard to interact with other developers and to write code without reinventing the wheel normally you could post a coding question on twitter and get an answer within minutes
1840666 it has something to do with keeping competitors from looking into it and finding out what apple did
1840667 with the nda were unable to talk with one another
1840668 we want the developer community to be a lot like the open source developing community where you can help and talk to one another about the best way to do these things
1840669 we werent able to get anywhere with apple and had nowhere else to turn
1840670 we couldnt talk to other developers to see if anyone else knew of a way to do it
1840671 i would urge apple to transition from its current position to one of supporting and encouraging a thriving open developer ecosystem for the iphone
1840672 i dont know the reasons why apple chose to go the nda route but there must be reasons
1840673 i hope that in time those reasons will become less important or even moot and we can get to an open environment
1840674 we are addressing them in a very measured and serious way to ensure that we in fact can execute this procurement in a manner that is fair to both parties and in the best interest of the warfighters and the taxpayers

1840679 microbial forensics has yet to be rigorously challenged in an adversarial setting
1840680 the italians have an intimidatory policy the idea is to scare immigrants so that when they go home they can tell their countrymen that italy is no place for foreigners
1840681 at the identification centers used to hold north africans immigrants often face violence and intimidation
1840682 but theyre not in a position to complain because theyll be expelled
1840683 it takes the people who need the most protection and makes things even harder for them
1840684 when you limit one persons rights you limit all of society
1840685 we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1840686 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values
1840687 the rules for the guant namo military commissions are so flawed that justice could never be served from start to finish this has been a monumental debacle of american justice
1840688 he was a driver and auto mechanic he was not at all a military man
1840689 hamdan suffered nearly seven years of unlawful detention only to face a process that falls far short
1840690 escape the rule of law and the requirements of justice
1840691 this outcome was pre determined not by the court but by the government well before the trial even began
1840692 the travesty of this is that mr hamdan should have been acquitted of all charges
1840693 the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully
1840694 without a doubt the business model of network television is suffering from competition with other channels who operate with fewer content restrictions

1840702 its partly a function of people having been on several tours to iraq but its in a large part a function of the way the institution itself has begun to accept iraq and afghanistan
1840703 last time in 2006 it was almost three or four times a week that we had to call in a platoon and re look at the statements and ask them about the evidence
1840704 it needs to change some of this non kinetic work needs to start getting drummed in back at garrison instead of these three week field problems where we go out and conduct nothing but kinetic operations

1840747 rep deweese has previously said he would step aside as majority leader if he ever became a distraction regrettably that day has arrived and it is time for him to honor his promise so we can move forward to do the peoples business
1840748 as a lifelong democrat it pains me to publicly question the leadership of my own party but i feel as though failing to speak up under these extraordinary circumstances would be an unforgivable exercise in hypocrisy not only would i be breaking a solemn promise to the people i represent to bring about true change to the culture of harrisburg but i would also be ignoring what i know in my heart and mind to be the right thing to do
1840749 i remain focused on my objective of improving the lives of pennsylvanians through the enactment of meaningful legislation and i cannot allow public comments of this nature to distract me from my work i am proud of the successes of the house democratic caucus thus far this session furthermore i led the creation of a speakers reform commission and supported the implementation of 32 new rules that brought transparency to the operations of the house chamber at the same time i implemented dozens of internal caucus reforms as a result we are now the only legislative caucus to have implemented a strong code of conduct a compliance amp ethics program and other significant financial and personnel controls more work remains to be done in the remaining weeks of this session and nothing should distract us from this purpose
1840750 for the agenda we have this fall we cannot be distracted by anything
1840751 clearly as the leader of the caucus when this happened there was certainly an inexcusable lack of focus on the management of the caucus
1840752 im not in the position of knowing the politics of his legislative district im not going to weigh in on what he should or shouldnt do thats his call there
1840753 when it comes to reorganizing in the fall i cant predict
1840754 being a leader is very difficult though the shot he took at josh was not very helpful to anyone

1840761 each morning i wake up and say to myself jerry you have two choices today you can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood i choose to be in a good mood each time something bad happens i can choose to be a victim or i can choose to learn from it i choose to learn from it every time someone comes to me complaining i can choose to accept their complaining or i can point out the positive side of life i choose the positive side of life
1840762 life is all about choices when you cut way all the junk every situation is a choice you choose how you react to situations you choose how people will affect your mood you choose to be in a good mood or bad mood the bottom line its your choice how you live life
1840763 if i were any better id be twins wanna see my scars

1840765 then as i lay on the floor i remembered that i had two choices i could choose to live or i could choose to die i chose to live
1840766 well there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me
1840767 she asked if i was allergic to anything yes i replied the doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply i took a deep breathe and yelled bullets over their laughter i told them i am choosing to live operate on me as if i am alive not dead
1840768 it is because of this and because of the fact that an agreement between the usa and me has been breached that i wish to challenge the legality of the proceedings in their entirety and as well as any individual step thereof
1840769 an absurd and laughable lie that karadzic has been spreading for years
1840770 it is no more than another lie from the most evil man in europe
1840771 i dont know if the panel can render fair what has already happened
1840772 the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully
1840773 they may not have hit a home run but at least they hit a triple
1840774 the travesty of this is that mr hamdan should have been acquitted of all charges
1840775 we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1840776 i can just not imagine a better diplomatic wingman than ambassador ryan crocker we were determined to achieve unity of effort
1840777 these are not light switch moments what you have is more of a rheostat many many rheostat moments where in small areas local areas districts and eventually provinces there is an ongoing transition and has been an ongoing transition for the iraqi forces to step more into the lead and the coalition forces to step back and provide enablers
1840778 it is this exercise of pushing the stone up the hill a sisyphean endeavor at times where you do make two steps up and one step back sometimes you make one step up and two steps back but over the last year or so from the large comprehensive offensive launched in june 2007 when we had all of the surge brigades on the ground since that time there has been a fairly steady degree of improvement
1840779 do you have an idea of what victory would be in iraq or the global war on terror

1840847 a real friend will stand by your side no matter what like if you scream and yell at them and try to hit them they will stay there and take it and they will try to help you no matter what the problem is they are trustworthy loving caring and undersatndable and they should be soo judgmental all the time like they should judge you for your problmes or anyhting and they want let nothing get between yall and this is what pep have to understand everybody fights freinds lovers families etc you just have to learn to forgive and forget and learn from your mistakes
1840848 a person who knows you inside and out who gives you support advice love trust and whom you trust love and support completely they will never judge you or your actions but understand your side in all things and support your decisions even if they think theyre not good real friends are hard to find so cherish any and all you have
1840849 the definition of a real friend to me is someone i can trust to be honest with me and someone i can confide in someone who will listen when i have a problem not just someone who wants me to listen but when it comes to me who needs a person to talk to they dont listen a friend is someone who would come to me when my boyfriend might come on to her him that is a true friend i could go on but this is what is the most important when looking for a true friend good luck

1840947 streamline the process and distribute the funds as quickly as possible the claims conference has reviewed over 25 000 files to identify eligible survivors
1840948 as required by the german government were being sent to 5790 survivors who the conference believed may be eligible

1840952 we condemn the actions of the bombers as a gross violation of the dignity and rights of the victims of the bombing of nightclubs in bali in 2002
1840953 those who have lost family members and who live with injury and disability because of the bombings are entitled to on going government and community compassion and support in their efforts to deal with their loss and suffering
1840954 those responsible for this crime deserve the most serious penalty but this should fall short of the death penalty
1840955 the commission has campaigned for the universal abolition of the death penalty around the world over the course of this year and we must take this action as a matter of principle
1840956 capital punishment should not be used as revenge or retribution or as a deterrent
1840957 we must be consistent in our defence of human life even in the case of people who are responsible for the most appalling actions
1840958 god ensured that cain was punished severely for killing abel but god also protected him from any attempt to kill him in retribution

1840965 information that is available only after a decision is made is irrelevant to the quality of the decision

1840967 and they lived happily thereafter until goro sama screws up the next film
1840968 cristiano is a great player he has a lot of quality and if he comes to madrid he would be welcomed by everyone
1840969 but at the moment no one can say anything about him because talking well about him also shows a slight lack of respect to the players that are here and this real madrid has a lot of people of quality
1840970 it would be bad for the dressing room if he gets a much higher salary than the rest of the squad
1840971 its not important to me but i know that other team mates would not like that at all here we have footballers like him for example arjen robben or robinho
1840972 its obvious that i want to play with cristiano but you also have to maintain the equilibrium in the dressing room
1840973 for me this madrid side do not need new signings
1840974 in the last few matches last year we were very solid and the team has grown a lot
1840975 this squad is strong enough and this season we are going to do more
1840976 its also obvious that if you bring in a player of a lot of quality it can be better for the team in that case the only one thing i think we need is to sign a striker
1840977 i hope robinho stays at madrid because i think he is equal to cristiano ronaldo
1840978 people have criticised robinho because he hasnt performed in the big matches but i saw important matches for manchester united and cristiano didnt perform either

1840980 part of what makes fallout great is the juxtaposition of this very happy optimistic 1950s esque view of life pre war and then seeing it after things went horribly wrong

1840982 but from a certain standpoint it limits what the game is really about to define it by saying youre just this genre sort of says you cant ever be more than that its a big sandbox and you get to be whoever you want and do whatever you want
1840983 this is from my new album thirteen stories high please buy three

1840993 the peruvian agreement contains the very labor agreements that labor and our allies have been asking for
1840994 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice

1841012 i have to say i was really in 2 minds until i saw your poster when i saw sf sinn fein were the only party advocating a no vote i was going to vote yes as i am not a sf fan but as a long time fan of yours and all your opinions your poster advocating a no is what swayed my decision
1841013 i am furious at our political representatives i felt they dismissed and belittled the no campaign and the intelligence of the irish voter you however very articulately expressed my own views on europe globalisation privatisation and the erosion of democracy concerns i know are shared by many using abortion and conscription to explain the no vote is just a scapegoat for the government to take them off the hook and as they do this affirms the fact that they are removed from the reality of life for the majority of irish workers

1841145 het is in de eerste plaats heel verwarrend voor reizigers die kunnen misschien wel met een bus ergens naar toe kunnen maar niet overstappen of niet meer terug daarnaast zet het de arbeidsverhoudingen onder druk en zorgt het voor veel onrust onder de chauffeurs als dit conflict voorbij is moeten ze gewoon met hun collegas en leidinggevenden samen verder kunnen werken maar dit gedrag van de vervoersbedrijven verziekt gewoon de arbeidsverhoudingen

1841238 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1841239 john mccain says we need offshore oil drilling and we need it now
1841240 senator barack obama has consistently opposed offshore drilling calling it a gimmick senator obamas solution to high gas prices is telling americans to make sure their tires are inflated
1841241 there are things that you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
1841242 the rnc is providing members of the media with complimentary tools related to barack obamas energy plan a brand new tire gauge
1841243 because instead of actually increasing americas domestic oil supply this is how obama thinks americans should try to alleviate burdensome pain at the pump
1841244 today im asking for your help in putting senator obamas tire gauge energy policy to the test mccain campaign manager rick davis had written to potential donors
1841245 with an immediate donation of 25 or more we will send you an obama energy plan tire pressure gauge will simply inflating your tires reduce the financial burden of high gas prices on your wallet
1841246 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore and we need it now he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage and the only thing ive heard him say is that we should inflate our tires so he has no plan for addressing the energy challenges that we face

1841264 would it be better to own a stopped clock or a clock that is one second too slow

1841266 but while the slow clock is always wrong the stopped clock is right twice a day
1841267 but the slow clock is slow by such an insignificant amount of time that it is basically as good as an accurate clock
1841268 and anyway how would you be able to tell when exactly the stopped clock was right
1841269 i have to go try and get my old clock back

1841316 this is not my preferred method to roll anything out

1841365 the film noirs that have gotten short shrift are womens pictures which are likely to take place in a home and deal with a romantic crisis the so called tear jerkers or hankies or weepies
1841366 womens noirs have been ignored because the mass media and academic descriptions of film noir only deal with the hardboiled
1841367 by my count these published sources of womens noirs nearly equal all published works aimed at a male audience but not all mens noirs are based on hardboiled short stories or hardboiled novels
1841368 the standard view of film noir lavishes attention on the femme fatale and ignores the woman in distress
1841369 it is critical to assess the full range of film noirs that were released between 1940 and 1959 if we wish to understand the full range of political and social issues that film noir addresses take for example womens sexuality
1841370 finally until womens film noirs are properly recognized a comprehensive history and a balanced analysis of film noir will be by definition impossible

1841474 the democratic party in its quest for power has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages creating a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist america
1841475 if mr obama had his way he would have pulled our troops from iraq years ago and initiated an unprecedented bloodbath turning over that country to the barbarianism of our enemies and while a misleading portrait of mr obama is being perpetrated by a media controlled by the democrats the obama camp has sent out people to attack the greatness of sen john mccain whose suffering and courage in a hanoi prison camp is an american legend
1841476 theres not a cell in my body that can accept the idea that mr obama can keep us safe from the terrorists around the world and from iran which is making great strides toward getting the atomic bomb

1841514 in retrospect lighting the match was my big mistake but i was only trying to save the gerbil
1841515 i pushed a cardboard toilet paper tube up his rectum and slipped ragout our gerbil in
1841516 as usual kiki shouted out armageddon my cue that hed had reached nirvana so to speak i tried to retrieve raggot but he simply would not come out so i peered into the tube and struck a match thinking the light might attract him
1841517 the match ignited a pocket of intestinal methane gas in kikis colon flames shot out the tube ignited mr tomaszewskis hair and severely burning his face it also set fire to the gerbils fur and whiskers causing it to scurry further up kikis colon which in turn ignited a larger pocket of gas further up the intestine propelling the rodent out of the cardboard tube like a cannonball

1841530 fifa merasa terkejut dan kecewa atas keputusan ini tetapi kami menghormatinya
1841531 meskipun demikian saya mengimbau klub klub izinkanlah para pemain anda ambil bagian di olimpiade
1841532 opini fifa belum berubah turnamen sepak bola olimpiade merupakan kompetisi tingkat tinggi terutama bagi sebagian besar pemain muda merupakan kesempatan untuk mendapatkan pengalaman internasional yang akan menjadi bekal bagi mereka di masa mendatang
1841533 karenanya hal itu berarti bahwa bukan hanya pemain yang mendapatkan keuntungan dari pengalaman semacam itu tetapi juga klubnya
1841534 turnamen olimpiade tidak menjadi jadwal utama dalam kalender resmi fifa dan tidak ada keputusan eksekutif fifa yang memberi hak kepada para pemain u 23 untuk turnamen ini
1841535 karenanya schalke 04 werder bremen dan barcelona tidak berkewajiban melepas pemain mereka yakni rafinha diego dan messi

1841566 as a passionate collector of homies and a chicana homie i have placed them in a position of artist activist and or educator in order to remember my experience of leaving my own barrio this series commemorates the learning opportunities and experiences the city of chicago has offered me as a chicana
1841567 i rock up to training and folkesy steve folkes someone that to be honest has never paid any interest in my personal life he comes up to me and starts saying youre not turning muslim are you
1841568 i start to think who is he to question my friends
1841569 if you asked hazem el masri about how i perceive muslims youll find ive often asked him questions about the religion because i dont fully understand it
1841570 if something comes up that i heard i ask him
1841571 its certainly not right of him to say that we took no interest in his home life or personal life
1841572 i supported him through the clovelly hotel thing when he was caught allegedly having sex in the toilets with ironwoman candice falzon his drink driving thing through his urinating in public thing
1841573 we stood up for him and did our best to try and get him through that so i think it is a pretty naive statement to make
1841574 in light of what has happened my advice about him not putting too much credence into what anthony mundine says was probably good advice
1841575 who is he to come and question my friends and their values and their religion
1841576 who does he think he is does he think he is god is he god or something
1841577 yeah whatever comes out of his mouth is that right
1841578 when i did join up with khoder and asked khoder to manage me
1841579 obviously to do something like that leave i wasnt happy
1841580 i havent been happy at the dogs for a while
1841581 nothing to do with the players i love my close mates but a whole range of things
1841582 it wasnt that long ago that he signed a five year deal so i assumed to commit to somewhere for five years he was happy to commit to that
1841583 i know sonny has been going around crying poormouth about only earning 500 000 a year cant survive on that
1841584 i dont know if it is just this generation whether it is young footballers or generation y in general but they expect everything and dont want to cough up for it
1841585 they expect that everything is going to be given to them on a platter and the fact he cant survive on 500 000 a year is a bit sad really
1841586 he will do anything now to try and justify this decision regardless
1841587 i was in the room last year when he agreed shook hands and signed a deal to stay with us five years
1841588 so regardless of what he says now its all p in the wind really
1841589 ah ahora en lugar de bombas van a fabricar heladeras el ctricas
1841590 last years reconciliation cup was a great recognition of the importance of rugby league to many indigenous communities
1841591 to be nominated this year for a position in the indigenous team of the century is humbling and an honour i rank equal to any other in the game
1841592 the modern explosion of indigenous talent owes much to the pioneers from earlier eras
1841593 it is great to see that the game has sought to recognise those who succeeded in times when to be indigenous was not such an advantage
1841594 the likes of george green glen paddy crouch frank fisher grandfather of cathy freeman my grandfather arthur stoker currie and lionel morgan who was the first aboriginal to play for australia all made the pathway easier for us
1841595 if i am lucky enough to retain my australian position my heart will also be with the indigenous side on the night
1841596 i know all the boys have been waiting for the opportunity to represent our people and i hope this will be the first of similar games in the future

1841602 the orbit of steins with which rosetta will rendezvous on 5 september closing to a distance of 800 km 500 miles is only known thanks to ground observations but not yet with the accuracy we would like for the close flyby
1841603 as rosettas distance from steins decreases the precision of the measurements for steins orbit will increase even further allowing us the best possible trajectory corrections later on before closest approach especially in early september
1841604 not with this guy he doesnt want to be treated any different than any other marine everybody respects him for wanting to come back after all he gave
1841605 prove in training that he could walk effectively get in and out of a humvee and perform other physical tasks
1841606 i can do stuff on a snowboard i dont think any other amputee can do
1841607 has earned a special status among marines because he demanded to be sent back to combat
1841608 he didnt just choose to come he fought to come we bled and sweated with this guy in iraq and he wants to be with us more than anything thats awesome
1841609 i roll with the punches ill always have some pain and discomfort and ive accepted that
1841610 if i were to get the opportunity to leave the wire i would be throwing gear on in a second happily i miss being outside and operating believe me the first opportunity ill be there

1841623 gee someone else out there probably already thought about this and has a better idea so ill take there stuff

1841700 travel i heard geoff dyer say not long ago had profound formal implications for lawrences handling of the novel
1841701 the apogee of lawrences visual sensibility is contained in sons and lovers after which he promised himself and his friends to abandon the visual and the imagistic

1841703 himself and his friends to abandon the visual and the imagistic

1841706 also will you tell me what then was the secret of the etruscans which you saw written so plainly in the place you went to please dont forget to tell me as they really do rather puzzle me the etruscans
1841707 the thought occurred to me suddenly when i was looking at the remains of paintings on the walls of etruscan tombs at tarquinia there the painted women dance in their transparent linen with heavier coloured borders opposite the naked limbed men in a splendour and an abandon which is not all abandoned there is a great beauty in them as of life which has not finished the dance is greek if you like but not finished off like the greek dancing the beauty is not so pure if you will as the greek beauty but also it is more ample not so narrowed and there is not the slightest element of abstraction of inhumanity which underlies all greek expression the tragic will the etruscans at least before the romans smashed them do not seem to have been tangled up with tragedy as the greeks were from the first there seems to have been a peculiar large carelessness about them very human and non moral as far as one can judge they never said certain acts are immoral because we say so they seem to have had a strong feeling for taking life sincerely as a pleasant thing even death was a gay and lively affair they are just dancing a dance with the elixir of life

1841737 the strategy behind all this isnt hard to discern drive up obamas negatives and render him unacceptable to pivotal voting blocs thus the depiction of him as too young too feckless and too pampered to be president the portrayal of him as precious self infatuated and effete and the emphasis on obamas rock star persona designed to engender envy and contempt among the swath of middle america for which hipness is no virtue but a sign of pretension
1841738 as peter hart a democrat who conducts the wall street journal poll with republican neil newhouse puts it
1841739 to many americans obama is still a stranger an exotic and mysterious stranger with an odd name a dark face a weird pastor a cheeky wife and a brief past
1841740 in the short term they have to try to define him barack obama as someone who thinks hes above everyone else
1841741 there has been a very intentional effort to paint him as somebody outside the mainstream other hes not one of us
1841742 i think the mccain campaign has been scrupulous about not directly saying it but its the subtext of this campaign

1841753 being a mother has taught me more about the grace of god and my own shortcomings than any other experience in my life i see gods grace every morning as they wake up healthy and strong as they laugh and giggle as they run and play as their minds develop right before my eyes my biggest lesson learned is to cherish every moment with your children they grow too fast god never gives you more than you can handle and i am going to do all that i can for my little ones especially when they face challenges
1841754 true some of the lessons theyve taught me were not very fun as they were happening but the good moments mix up with the not so good moments in a wonderful curriculum ordained for me by god himself
1841755 i honestly can say that being a mother is the most powerful and important feeling in the world
1841756 god gave me strength when i couldnt go on life when my body was trying to shut down encouragement to my broken heart meals when the refrigerator was empty a place to live when ends did not meet peace in the midst of turmoil and a contentment that went beyond my circumstances sure life gets hard now and then my heart may still become anxious and my mind may begin to assume the worse but today i know that contentment comes from within i have learned to be content regardless of my circumstances because god is faithful to me i am so very blessed

1841823 god gave me strength when i couldnt go on life when my body was trying to shut down encouragement to my broken heart meals when the refrigerator was empty a place to live when ends did not meet peace in the midst of turmoil and a contentment that went beyond my circumstances sure life gets hard now and then my heart may still become anxious and my mind may begin to assume the worse but today i know that contentment comes from within i have learned to be content regardless of my circumstances because god is faithful to me i am so very blessed

1841846 but examine everything carefully hold fast to that which is good
1841847 all scripture is inspired by god and profitable for teaching for reproof for correction for training in righteousness
1841848 the prophet who has a dream may relate his dream but let him who has my word speak my word in truth what does straw have in common with grain
1841849 but know this first of all that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of ones own interpretation
1841850 be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock among which the holy spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of god which he purchased with his own blood

1841864 we dont want to die we dont want to go into prison but we have to be prepared that if god puts that before us we are going to be faithful when the pressures come
1841865 i look at the number that did suffer not just a physical suffering but the suffering of the persecution the resistance and its a tremendous testimony to me of how god is moving on the chinese people to reach the chinese people
1841866 its on the fringes of the first amendment but there is some protection
1841867 however this case doesnt seem to fit the bill because this was a minor child and a minor child in a nude performance is not protected
1841868 thats really stretching it it was a bar it was a minor child that got up spontaneously to do a nude dance that is not protected
1841869 this is a tragic situation because a minor was involved

1841876 everything the man sits on when riding will be unclean
1841877 anyone the man with a discharge touches without rinsing his hands with water must wash his clothes and bathe with water and he will be unclean till evening
1841878 a clay pot that the man touches must be broken and any wooden article is to be rinsed with water

1841885 when she is cleansed from her discharge she must count off seven days and after that she will be ceremonially clean
1841886 you must keep the israelites separate from things that make them unclean so they will not die in their uncleanness for defiling my dwelling place which is among them

1841901 trainer sollen ja spieler besch ftigen aber klinsmann muss auch viele trainer besch ftigen was kraft und zeit in anspruch nimmt ich h tte mir das nicht mehr zugemutet sieben acht neun trainer zu besch ftigen
1841902 selbst etwas unter druck gesetzt daran wird man gemessen wenn es schlechter l uft ich bin aber berzeugt dass j rgen mit seiner winner mentalit t bayern wieder dahin bringt wo sie hingeh ren in der champions league aber nach ganz oben braucht es auch zeit

1841908 hezbollah has already smuggled in such missiles or is merely seeking to do so
1841909 this is really intended as a wake up call to show what could happen if nothing changes
1841910 it really needs to be more than an individual effort
1841911 i cant believe channel 7 isnt on the air with a storm coming
1841912 laws against homosexual behavior should remain on the books not to be indiscriminately enforced against anyone who happens to be caught violating them but to be used when necessary to send a clear message that those who flagrantly violate societys regulation of sexual behavior cannot be permitted to remain as acceptable equal citizens within that society those who are not willing or able to obey the rules should honestly admit the fact and withdraw from membership
1841913 in another column i will talk seriously and candidly about the state of scientific research on the causes of homosexuality and the reasons why homosexuality persists even though it does not provide a reproductive advantage
1841914 it is true people can organize online however people still need to be willing to do the hard work of being a for example citizens still need to sit next to child and help them learn to read rushkoff in his blog

1841918 federal internet gambling prosecutions have involved sports betting creating a lack of authoritative court decisions on the applicability of other federal criminal statutes to internet poker and casino style gambling
1841919 we are puzzled by the introduction of h r 6663 and by the purpose of this legislation previous federal case law re mastercard 2002 made it clear that existing federal criminal law wire act of 1961 applies only to sports wagering and not to internet poker further the uigea itself states no provision of this law shall be construed as altering limiting or extending any federal or state law thus h r 6663 only confuses a clear judicial standing on this matter
1841920 congressman pete sessions has been and continues to be a good friend to poker players who want the freedom to play americas greatest card game

1841925 its not normal for women to be skinny throughout pregnancy but they are seeing pictures in the media that say something completely the opposite
1841926 a normal pregnancy shape is chunkier and bumpier but women dont like that look in tight maternity clothes
1841927 there seems to be a real sense of competition to get back to pre baby shape as soon as possible which is not realistic and certainly not healthy
1841928 we are doing that and we are addressing them in a very measured and serious way to ensure that we in fact can execute this procurement in a manner thats fair to both parties and is in the best interests of the warfighters and the taxpayers
1841929 each offeror will be provided an equal amount of time to sit down and discuss face to face what their views are of the draft rfp

1841934 i was just a child then but i learned many things from the maestro
1841935 over the years luciano became a mentor he told me to always respect the music but also use the heart he said it is important not to give too much in the beginning of a concert you should administer your energy like a tennis match which of course does not have only one game i dedicate this program in chicago to him because he gave me so much
1841936 on my album i try to connect opera with the pop to relate the two very different things together
1841937 there are really no boundaries to the two worlds and we must bring people to opera its only a matter of culture
1841938 but i decided not to stay with il divo because i wanted to continue to do my opera performances
1841939 they do not understand the culture of opera and they cant sing with real technique
1841940 vittorio grigolo is a wonderful young musician he sings the role of rodolfo in a fresh sweet sensitive tenor voice that is nevertheless capable of clarion power
1841941 its more me more my music and it will be more rockier its an honor to work with placido
1841942 he understands how important it is to get younger people to the opera house
1841943 i love the passion and great energy that he gives to everything and everybody time is very short but he still makes time for everyone its a lesson ive taken to heart
1841944 just when were starting to create well designed civilised public space in many english towns along comes a rash of intrusive neon screens

1841946 melalui pengembangan model itu yang akan kami garap bersama pemerintah daerah maka dapat memberikan dampak ikutan yang positif pada berbagai sektor ekonomi bukan saja bagi usaha transportasi tetapi juga perhotelan restoran obyek wisata penjualan suvenir dan lainnya
1841947 satu hal lagi yang perlu segera kita tangani adalah tahapan kerja sama dengan pemerintah daerah ini akan menjadi dasar pemerintah pusat untuk melangkah lebih lanjut sesuai undang undang pelayaran yang baru
1841948 saya sudah mencoba menumpang kapal pesiar kapasitas sedang untuk 80 100 orang ternyata juga memutar musik lagu lagu daerah perlu pengembangan lebih lanjut dan menyiapkan program secara dinamis dalam upaya menjaring wisatawan mancanegara
1841949 kini setelah memastikan akan mengakomodasi 20 persen calon legislatif caleg dari kalangan muslim partai damai sejahtera mendekati para purnawirawan tni dan polri untuk bergabung dalam satu barisan bersama membangun negeri yang makin damai serta kian sejahtera

1841951 kami berharap para purnawirawan lainnya bergabung dan mendaftarkan diri menjadi caleg pds
1841952 mengapa mereka diajak masuk karena kami masih sangat yakin dengan kemampuan para purnawirawan tni dan polri ini untuk meneruskan kiprah pengabdiannya kepada bangsa dan negara tercinta indonesia makanya kami sangat berharap para purnawirawan tni dan polri yang serius terjun di dunia politik untuk bergabung dengan pds

1841957 i asked barack obama what he wanted for his birthday

1841959 partial birth abortions so long as there is an exception for the life and health of the mother
1841960 give women information about a whole series of things the health consequences et cetera and information about adoption
1841961 roe vs wade is ultimately about saying that there is a realm of personal liberty for people to make this decision
1841962 partial birth abortions so long as there is an exception for the life and health of the mother
1841963 give women information about a whole series of things the health consequences et cetera and information about adoption
1841964 oh and remember when the big complaint was how the primaries just had to end because there was so little time to campaign against mccain
1841965 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1841966 the conference agreement provides for 14 6 billion in tax breaks and credits between 2005 and 2015 including 2 8 billion for fossil fuel production
1841967 this bill does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country the handouts to big business and oil companies are irresponsible and will be disastrous for people of arizona i cannot in good conscience vote to pass legislation that does not adequately address issues related to energy efficiency security and energy independence
1841968 massive pork slabs dished out to the vested interests who needed them least
1841969 while it contains some useful provisions it also contains massive pork slabs dished out to the vested interests who need them least like oil companies and has no overarching strategy to deal with the new world
1841970 what is left is a candy store of tax breaks and subsidies for both the highly profitable oil and gas companies and the more struggling alternative energy producers it is a bill that only industry executives and lobbyists could love and even they dont want their names on it
1841971 meanwhile both houses conspired in some spectacular giveaways one would ease environmental restrictions on oil and gas companies drilling on public lands the other would shower billions in undeserved tax breaks on the same companies even as they wallow in the windfall profits produced by 60 a barrel oil
1841972 given how long congress labored over this legislation and how much negotiation was required to get it to this stage its hard not to be disappointed by a bill that in effect preserves the status quo
1841973 both are also laden with pork the senate version is a little less porky than the house measure but still contains lavish tax incentives that go primarily to the oil and gas industries despite an admonition by bush that tax breaks for oil companies are unnecessary in a time of high gas prices congress seems intent on giveaways the ideal fate for this energy bill like its predecessors is death by committee better no energy policy for another year than a sham
1841974 you know the energy bill that passed in 2005 was larded with all kinds of special interest breaks giveaways to the oil companies senator obama voted for it i did not because i knew that it was going to be an absolute nightmare now were all out on the campaign trail talking about taking the tax subsidies away from the oil companies some of which were in that 2005 energy bill
1841975 however i am disappointed that the bill provides nearly 6 billion in tax breaks for oil gas and coal and in addition provides tax credits for nuclear energy these tax breaks are provided despite the fact that president bush has repeatedly stated that we do not need tax breaks for the oil and gas industry given the high prices americans are experiencing
1841976 our nations energy crisis has reached historic levels we need policy whose boldness is commensurate with that crisis but thats not what were getting instead were getting a pork laden lobbyist driven dream bill its inexcusable
1841977 the congressional budget office cbo estimates that implementing the bill will cost 5 1 billion in 2006 and 35 9 billion over the 2006 2010 period i am concerned that this estimate does not include the at least 10 1 billion in unpaid for tax breaks the 10 1 billion includes 5 7 billion in production tax credits and 4 4 billion in various subsidies to the oil gas and nuclear industries
1841978 statement by u s senator barbara boxer on the energy bill
1841979 furthermore this bill awards multi million dollar tax breaks to those same companies which are reaping windfalls from record high oil prices at the expense of washington consumers to continue us down the path of fossil fuels which are a key contributor to climate change
1841980 once again it appears that old energy wins out over new energy and instead we get a goodie bag for oil coal and nuclear
1841981 schumer energy bill is historic mistake and step backwards for the environment taxpayers and national security
1841982 im working on lost so i will be returning to that in august
1841983 insiders at facebook are selling stock in the social networking company and the prices theyre getting for their shares suggest the sky high valuation backers once placed on the company may prove unrealistic
1841984 say what you will about barack obama people gravitate when you have something positive to say people want to follow hopeful optimistic civil decent leaders they dont want to follow some negative scornful person
1841985 i was against the war before i was for it

1842021 oh what a twist locke is the non beleiver and now jack is thats would b shit
1842022 i think lockes contribution to the islands science effort will be in the context of the fertility problem as he manages to successfully impregnate all the new new otherton burlap clad hotties
1842023 the present invention pertains to the field of preservation of human tissue in the field of mortuary science more particularly the present invention pertains to a method and preservative composition for embalming a dead body using an enviromentally safe formaldehyde free embalming composition
1842024 maybe this explains the triangle if cuse and lindeloff are equals in their pull with the way the plot develops and they are both projecting their hopes onto their favorite characters so damon and carlton should just have an oil wrestling match to settle the love traingle question i reckon

1842032 well if gas prices were 4 gallon like they are in europe then people would really start thinking about transportation alternatives
1842033 the reason europeans drive less is because the built environment supports walking and bicycling for some trips

1842050 i cant get a feature of this iphone app work the result is im going to settle on an inferior approach app wont be as good fucking nda
1842051 the fucking nda is here to stay it has certainly crushed my enthusiasm for the platform big time
1842052 re the fucking nda its pretty clear that this is being done for competitive reasons at the cost of a lot of developer productivity
1842053 it started out as a joke on twitter with the iphone community
1842054 i figured i would get about 10 000 visitors a day and it would go away in about a week the site has been linked to and commented on twitter ever since
1842055 there is no legal way for developers to talk about they are developing
1842056 no way to post tutorials no way to give code away its hard to interact with other developers and to write code without reinventing the wheel normally you could post a coding question on twitter and get an answer within minutes
1842057 it has something to do with keeping competitors from looking into it and finding out what apple did
1842058 with the nda were unable to talk with one another
1842059 we want the developer community to be a lot like the open source developing community where you can help and talk to one another about the best way to do these things
1842060 we werent able to get anywhere with apple and had nowhere else to turn
1842061 we couldnt talk to other developers to see if anyone else knew of a way to do it
1842062 i would urge apple to transition from its current position to one of supporting and encouraging a thriving open developer ecosystem for the iphone
1842063 i dont know the reasons why apple chose to go the nda route but there must be reasons
1842064 i hope that in time those reasons will become less important or even moot and we can get to an open environment

1842081 we see tremendous growth for new compelling applications and services across consumer segments and product lines in particular when we can provide flexible business models and options for our carrier partners and consumers similar to those currently experienced on the web
1842082 research has shown that the user paid model is one of the key barriers to the growth of mobile data consumption and revenues
1842083 as the mobile phone is fast becoming a media channel amobees ad funded model works to bridge the gap between device manufacturers operators and advertisers creating value for all stakeholders through increased data consumption and greater revenues

1842102 how long would bruce wayne have to train to become batman in some of the timelines you see in the comics the backstory is he goes away for five years some its three to five years or eight years or 12 years in terms of the physical changes strength and conditioning thats happening fairly quickly were talking three to five years in terms of the physical skills to be able to defend himself against all these opponents all the time i would benchmark that at 10 to 12 years probably the most reality based representation of batman and his training was in batman begins batman cant really afford to lose losing means death or at least not being able to be batman anymore but another benchmark is having enough skill and experience to defend himself without killing anyone because thats part of his credo it would be much easier to fight somebody if you could incapacitate them with extreme force punching somebody in the throat could be a lethal blow thats pretty easy to do but if youre thinking about something that doesnt result in lethal force thats more tricky its really hard for people to get their heads around i think to be that good to not actually lethally injure anyone requires an extremely high level of skill that would take maybe 15 to 18 years to accumulate

1842110 could the state simply abolish marriage as a legal definition and leave it as a religious institution
1842111 arent the rights and responsibilities of domestic partners and marriage partners substantially the same
1842112 this case is not about whether the domestic partnership laws are fair or equal but whether to denying marriage to lesbians and gays is equal
1842113 since these california cases were filed the top courts in six other states have been asked to legalize same sex marriage new jerseys top court gave lawmakers the option of adopting civil unions as an alternative and a ruling is pending in connecticut but none of the other courts was persuaded
1842114 i am writing to you from the california supreme court where i just had the privilege and honor of witnessing history in the making
1842115 for the past three hours the highest court in the most populous state in the nation engaged in a spirited discussion
1842116 equality california and each of you as our members was brilliantly represented by shannon price minter legal director of the national center for lesbian rights
1842117 shannon and therese eloquently made the case that domestic partnership is not equal to marriage and does not conform to the california constitutions mandate of equality
1842118 the state tried to argue that this inferior separate and unequal status is somehow sufficient that providing us with less than equality was somehow actually equality and that discrimination could be justified by tradition then the right wing anti lgbt organizations did their usual hateful and mean spirited song and dance arguing against all evidence that we are inferior parents and should be denied our rights shannon and terry did a terrific job rebutting the arguments of the state of california and the right wing groups
1842119 separate but equal is it possible what will the california supreme court decide
1842120 this case is not about whether the domestic partnership laws are fair or equal but whether to denying marriage to lesbians and gays

1842139 lds historians brigham young fueled hysteria but didnt order massacre
1842140 it is true that youngs rhetoric during a time ofwar was part of the backdrop against which the massacre happened
1842141 no faith believing mormon could ever acknowledge brigham youngs complicity in the massacre and no gentile could think otherwise
1842142 we are going to be arguing about the details for another 151 years
1842143 a systematic effort to cover up and destroy records diaries and court records of the day
1842144 we have got to give a lot of credit to the lds church for stepping up and owning the mountain meadows massacre
1842145 this is something that has been swept under the rug denied and hidden for 151 years this book represents a real paradigm shift and thats remarkable
1842146 we came up with the idea for the book ourselves we were not assigned to do it
1842147 we sought the cooperation of church leaders to get access to information such as the first presidencys confidential collection but asked that we retain full editorial control and theyve honored that
1842148 the trio of authors has properly tagged direct responsibility for the massacre on local church leaders and nauvoo legion officers with southern paiutes playing a minor role
1842149 i give credit to the authors for this somewhat nontraditional view as well as their willingness to rescue the reputation of the victims from the appalling vilification thats taken place for 150 years they have also identified the impact of gov brigham youngs overheated rhetoric and provocative actions in helping to create a violent atmosphere in utah leading up to the massacre
1842150 make obsolete previous studies and without doubt will constitute the necessary starting point for all future ones
1842151 our marching orders as i understood them were to find the truth and tell it thats what we have tried to do
1842152 my feeling is the best approach is to face it
1842153 okay cancer youve had your run at me and ive won so move on and leave me alone
1842154 ok sir you would like to change one passenger to fly home on the 14th instead of the 8th
1842155 ok i can get you on a flight that goes through vegas is that ok
1842156 ok and this flight leaves at time is that ok
1842157 ok and you know that you only have to pay the difference in the tickets from what you have already paid
1842158 ok you do realize that this is just for one passenger right i dont want to be paying for the full flight
1842159 yes this is only one passenger would you like to make that change
1842160 no i dont want to pay 1 295 00 plus the 150 00 change fee we will figure out another way

1842168 the dark elf gives the cat woman a menacing stare and says
1842169 some of the greatest philosophers have said that very thing
1842170 okay okay say your one thing that you have to say
1842171 these two guys should be the guys replacing ebert amp roeper you can really tell that they dont like each other
1842172 your attitude should be the same as that of christ jesus who being in very nature god did not consider equality with god something to be grasped but made himself nothing taking the very nature of a servant being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even death on a cross therefore god exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
1842173 let us fix our eyes on jesus the author and perfecter of our faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross scorning its shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of god consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men so that you will not grow weary and lose heart
1842174 it is no longer i who live but christ who lives in me
1842175 live in harmony with one another be sympathetic love as brothers be compassionate and humble do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult but with blessing because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing for
1842176 whoever would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from deceitful speech he must turn from evil and do good he must seek peace and pursue it for the eyes of the lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer but the face of the lord is against those who do evil
1842177 who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good
1842178 i think what will happen now is that these young men will be allowed to have a fair trial
1842179 now a new judge will be appointed hell know that he is under the scope and the chances will be better for a fair trial
1842180 whatever ultimately happens concerning the judge this does not mean these cases go away
1842181 it will just take longer to get them to trial however i may seek to have the decision overturned by taking a writ to the court of appeals
1842182 the trials need to be moved to another venue because of the attention placed on this i dont think anyone in the parish can claim to be objective
1842183 they all have been caught up in a lynch mob mentality that prevailed in jena
1842184 they thought of these young men as thugs unlike none jena had ever experienced and they treated them in court as dangerous adults
1842185 he walters has to realize that no one takes him seriously as an objective prosecutor
1842186 if another prosecutor is brought in i believe they can reach a plea agreement that will be acceptable to all parties

1842225 last week california governor arnold schwarzenegger ordered a pay cut to minimum wage of 6 55 hr for 200 000 state workers because a state budget hadnt been approved yet the state controller who has opposed the pay cut on principle and legal grounds now says the pay cut he says it would take six months to go to minimum wage and nine months more to restore salaries once a budget is passed the system is based on cobol according to the sacramento bee and the state hasnt yet found the funds or resources in ten years of trying to upgrade it

1842275 previously we shared costs such as fuel and maintenance with other partners who were based down there such as south yorkshire police however with the airport closing this is not cost effective so the aircraft will return to leeds bradford airport where we have that infrastructure in place
1842276 its the biggest fighter aircraft deal since the early 1990s
1842277 foreign vendors would be provided great flexibility in effecting tie up with indian partners for this purpose
1842278 the aircraft are likely to be in service for over 40 years great care has been taken to ensure that only determinable factors which do not lend themselves to any subjectivity are included in the commercial selection model the selection would be transparent and fair it may be recalled that the defence minister shri a k antony while chairing the defence acquisition council meeting on june 29 2007 had outlined three guiding principles for this procurement scheme first the operational requirements of iaf should be fully met second the selection process should be competitive fair and transparent so that best value for money is realized lastly indian defence industries should get an opportunity to grow to global scales
1842279 russians have their problems of delayed projects and unreliable spare supply but they give access to everything unlike the americans
1842280 our response has been fully compliant with the iaf request for proposal rfp however the extent of technology transfer would be dependent on the permission we receive from the us government the issue is under discussion
1842281 gripen in will provide india with a capability that offers complete independence of weapon supply we will do this by transferring all necessary technologies to enable indian industry and the air force to build operate and modify gripen to meet all indigenous requirements over time
1842282 the fighter wont need a scheduled visit to a maintenance depot until it has clocked a minimum of 6 000 hours of flying time and even well beyond that

1842284 the ministry of defence has received no offer from the united states for transfer of high technology weaponry including its 5th generation joint strike fighter f 35
1842285 deba r mohanty a senior fellow in security studies at the new delhi based observer research foundation who reviewed a copy of the rfp shortly after it was issued to the six contenders told janes in early october that the complexity of the rfp document is the main reason why the deadline is likely to be delayed a further six months until september 2008

1842289 when you have palestinians being forced to flee by other palestinians it is a tragedy
1842290 this is the behaviour of a brutal dictatorship not a political party working in the interests of its people
1842291 it is beyond doubt that there are now two separate palestinian territories so who does israel deal with mahmoud abbas does not speak for palestinians in gaza and hamas is not interested in any negotiations with israel at all this civil war makes a permanent solution impossible to negotiate
1842292 redmond washington based microsoft said it continues to build up its infrastructure

1842309 the expedience of reducing particulate pollution has prompted officials to temporarily shut down chemical production in and around beijing prior to the olympics this crackdown is likely to include pharmaceutical production
1842310 china is the largest producer of bulk pharmaceutical chemicals also known as active pharmaceutical ingredients apis which are made into drugs that supply the world with india it supplies 40 of the api used in u s pharmaceutical production an amount predicted to increase to 80 by 2020 china provides at least 20 of the apis used in making indian generic drugs as well as about 75 of the intermediate products indian firms require to synthesize the final products they sell
1842311 for the next two months western and indian companies will find it difficult to import most chemical substances including bulk drugs and intermediates from china this could prove costly to patients and especially costly for the indian generics industry because their companies are so reliant on chinese inputs
1842312 given that many of chinas bulk api manufacturers operate around beijing product prices will still increase drastically over the next few weeks as supply is constricted from beijing alone
1842313 it is impossible to calculate how many lives will be lost because drug prices are rising
1842314 as you know the proposal for a state of the art veterans facility at fitzsimons was a centerpiece of the vas capital construction plan under the capital asset realignment for enhanced services cares process
1842315 in april 2008 the va proposed a new plan that would considerably alter the original project objective
1842316 we have concluded that the best way forward is to continue with a modified version of the original comprehensive stand alone hospital concept as outlined by the va through the cares process
1842317 in the vas own internal planning documents several cost saving measures are proposed for the cares recommended stand alone hospital concept
1842318 we view the fitzsimons va hospital project not only as a va project but as a collaborative effort between the department the colorado congressional delegation and the veterans whom it is our shared duty to serve we all bear responsibility and so we must all work together to ensure veterans throughout the rocky mountain west can benefit from the most comprehensive health service delivery plan that our government can provide

1842353 its time that people get the message that alcohol can be deadly when mixed with operating a vehicle on the road or a vessel in the water to avoid an arrest or worse the simple solution is not to drive or operate any vehicle while impaired
1842354 drinking alcohol on the water can be just as dangerous as on land the impacts of alcohol are naturally accelerated by marine factors such as sun wind motion and spray increasing the risk of accidents capsizing or falling overboard

1842450 shows that the dramatic rise in oil prices in june and the subsequent fall in price in july cant be explained by any of the fundamentals of supply and demand instead it could be a result of the trading strategies of major market players cantwell and mccullough said new data collection tools are needed so that federal agencies can identify the culprits and stop any market manipulation
1842451 mr mcculloughs research clearly shows that oil prices are no longer tied to supply and demand
1842452 statistically this research shows that prices are spiking absent of a crisis like a natural disaster or supply disruption however prices then fell when congress began serious debate on how to crack down on those who may be trying to manipulate the markets research shows that traders may well be in control of the market not supply and demand and consumers have been left paying the price
1842453 there is evidence of a troubling concentration of ownership in the oil markets
1842454 this allows a few players to have undue influence on setting prices however the regulators are driving blind through this crisis since they are collecting such little information that reveals who is doing what in the market

1842511 there is virtually no evidence that voter fraud ever occurs except by individuals and in rare instances
1842512 broke with established department policy by getting involved with contentious and partisan litigation on the eve of the election mr von spakovsky drafted legal briefs between the republican and democratic parties in three battleground states ohio michigan and florida just before the election all in favor of the republican partys position
1842513 these briefs ran counter to the well established practice of the civil rights division not to inject itself into litigation or election monitoring on the eve of an election where it would be viewed as expressing a political preference or could have an impact on a political dispute
1842514 they cooked up that there is a general exception to the policy because they wanted to prevent more fraud but indicting people before the election was not going to change anything registration had already closed there just wasnt a justification for bending the law
1842515 federal prosecutors and investigators should be extremely careful not to conduct overt investigations during the pre election period or while the elections are underway
1842516 a criminal investigation by armed badged federal agents runs the obvious risk of chilling legitimate voting and campaign activities

1842525 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
1842526 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
1842527 it is fortunate that this incident didnt end in a very ugly gunfight
1842528 it is not an incident that we are aware of
1842529 an all out struggle to deter criminal organizations from operating on both sides of our common border
1842530 law enforcement operations have led from time to time to innocent incursions by both u s and mexican law enforcement personnel and military units into the territory of both nations and in particular along non demarcated areas of our border
1842531 we always try to solve these incidents in a cooperative fashion and as acknowledged by the border patrol this was the case in the episode at ajo
1842532 withhold further comment on this incident until we see how our leaders handle it
1842533 down to a t and it matched exactly what they mexican soldiers wear
1842534 nobody was ever held accountable particularly galling is the fact that the mexican military often pulls these stunts in humvees donated to them by the american taxpayers we note that border patrol agents have historically driven worn out junk vehicles
1842535 the only thing you can do in that kind of situation is seek cover
1842536 im not going to lose someone in an unfair fight
1842537 speak to the israelites and say to them when any man has a bodily discharge the discharge is unclean
1842538 any bed the man with a discharge lies on will be unclean and anything he sits on will be unclean
1842539 whoever touches the man who has a discharge must wash his clothes and bathe with water and he will be unclean till evening
1842540 if the man with the discharge spits on someone who is clean that person must wash his clothes and bathe with water and he will be unclean till evening
1842541 everything the man sits on when riding will be unclean
1842542 anyone the man with a discharge touches without rinsing his hands with water must wash his clothes and bathe with water and he will be unclean till evening
1842543 a clay pot that the man touches must be broken and any wooden article is to be rinsed with water
1842544 when a man is cleansed from his discharge he is to count off seven days for his ceremonial cleansing he must wash his clothes and bathe himself with fresh water and he will be clean
1842545 when a man has an emission of semen he must bathe his whole body with water and he will be unclean till evening
1842546 when a woman has her regular flow of blood the impurity of her monthly period will last seven days and anyone who touches her will be unclean till evening
1842547 anything she lies on during her period will be unclean and anything she sits on will be unclean
1842548 if a man lies with her and her monthly flow touches him he will be unclean for seven days any bed he lies on will be unclean
1842549 when a woman has a discharge of blood for many days at a time other than her monthly period or has a discharge that continues beyond her period she will be unclean as long as she has the discharge just as in the days of her period
1842550 when she is cleansed from her discharge she must count off seven days and after that she will be ceremonially clean
1842551 you must keep the israelites separate from things that make them unclean so they will not die in their uncleanness for defiling my dwelling place which is among them

1842553 we are excited about the potential of irobot negotiator for a range of public safety professionals including law enforcement personnel domestic security officers and counter terrorism forces
1842554 there is growing support and demand for unmanned ground robots as people recognize the difference they make by offering life saving eyes on benefits to teams in the field we believe that the low entry price point for irobot negotiator will help make it accessible to local state and federal agencies that would not have been able to afford a robot otherwise
1842555 we are putting the full weight of irobot behind this product offering excellent production quality and service
1842556 negotiator will play a significant role in helping to resolve situations successfully while keeping public safety professionals at safe distances

1842589 the prosecutions theme was that however small his role may have been people like mr hamdan make al qaeda possible
1842590 im looking forward to sharing some of the important initiatives underway within the department but more importantly i really want to hear from iowas citizens one thing i am particularly proud of is the rapport that the dnr has with the public this is a relationship we value highly within the dnr
1842591 this is completely outrageous im sure if there were sewage in tom lathams basement he wouldnt be so focused on scoring political points for the republican party
1842592 people in iowa are struggling to put their lives back together after the devastating floods tom latham decided to play partisan politics instead of fighting to get the money back to iowa
1842593 we need an independent thinker in washington like becky greenwald who wont put politics over the needs of the people of the 4th district
1842594 the floods of 2008 caused unprecedented damage in iowa and it is essential that iowans receive disaster relief as quickly as possible
1842595 iowa deserves funding without bureaucratic delay and im pleased that communities affected by the floods will now receive this much needed infusion of funds i will keep working each day to ensure that iowans have the resources they need to continue moving down the long road to recovery
1842596 communities residents and businesses affected by the floods need assistance this critical disaster relief should never have been withheld by the administration
1842597 we urged the secretary of hud to immediately release this funding so further assistance can quickly be distributed to provide individuals and businesses with the security to rebuild and communities with the support necessary to recover from this disaster
1842598 with some nudging from the iowa delegation and house appropriators im pleased that the administration realized that iowa and other states need the disaster assistance now not tomorrow
1842599 this is another example of how it is better to go before the camera and try to make some kind of a show out of something
1842600 we need to be looking at alternative green answers we need to get nuclear power onto the discussion table
1842601 i just look at it more as an election year prank and we have serious work that needs to be done and compromising and discussion that needs to happen and not be trying to pull stunts to garner attention
1842602 when you think about it thats two times the physical size of the state of iowa and so id like to understand why we dont make use of those lands and that offshore drilling thats already available
1842603 we absolutely need a comprehensive energy policy thats going to take us into the next several decades
1842604 i have read the new rumor on goonies 2 and all i can say of that is i have checked my sources and as for now it still does not exist sorry clint i guess you better check your source however i would love to be proven wrong

1842642 goes too far in requiring proof of a case within a case whenever a plaintiff agrees to a settlement and then alleges attorney malpractice in the underlying case i believe it is possible for legal malpractice to be so egregious that proof of a case within a case would be unnecessary this case in which the attorneys steadfastly refused to continue with trial despite their clients sincere desire to continue may be such a case
1842643 g iven the procedural posture of this case the appellees need establish only that there was sufficient evidence to defeat a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict i dissent because i believe that the evidence in this case when weighed most strongly in favor of enc is sufficient to defeat a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict

1842647 when wearing purebuds earphones the main body is arranged with the rubber ring as an ear cushion positioned in the ear canal and the speaker unit is designed facing opposite to the ear in conventional earphones the speaker is simply placed facing the inside of the ear the main body incorporates acoustic chambers directing the reverse sound waves from the rear end of the earphone to flow into the ear canal and then mix with the sound wave from the rear end of the speaker the outside audio flow has a physical delay in relation to the audio flow from the rear end of the speaker thereby creating spatial and surround sound effects

1842669 si gioca sempre per conquistare la nazionale sono contentissimo ma voglio ringraziare innanzitutto il napoli credo che il merito sia delle due partite che ho giocato in azzurro in intertoto se sono stato selezionato per questa gara internazionale con la bielorussia centra molto il risalto che mi ha dato la mia nuova squadra ho fatto bene e sono stato ripagato
1842670 beh io con il pocho non ho mai giocato e lo aspetto con ansia e un talento straordinario che aiuta molto la punta centrale per il momento speriamo di poter ritrovarci insieme in azzurro e fare cose importanti con il napoli poi dellargentina ne parleremo in futuro la nostra nazionale ora qui

1842676 to have fought his way into hitlers east prussia as a proud red army soldier in the harshest war on record to have been arrested and incarcerated for a chance indiscretion to have served a full sentence of servitude and been released on the very day that stalin died and then to have developed cancer and known the whole rigor and misery of a soviet era isolation hospital what could you fear after that
1842677 but it seems that solzhenitsyn did have a worry or a dread not that he himself would be harmed but that none of his work would ever see print

1842843 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

1842872 in the absence of a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for in our extended package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive
1842873 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next steps
1842874 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well

1843011 la rinuncia da parte dellanas a portare avanti la trasformazione della e45 per limpossibilit di provvedere a tutte le modifiche richieste dalla commissione di valutazione ambientale la dice lunga non solo sulla qualit del progetto ma anche sulla sua economicit dichiara lauro ciurnelli presidente del circolo di legambiente di perugia che da anni segue le vicende della infrastrutturazione regionale fortunatamente ora viene meno anche lidea di ricorrere al
1843012 ci delude la mancanza di lungimiranza di tutte le forze politiche della regione di maggioranza come di opposizione che tranne le meritorie eccezioni senza troppi distinguo continuano a ritenere importanti i progetti che potenziano la mobilit ed il traffico su gomma e privato senza considerare minimamente la necessit del cambiamento obbligato dalla criticit ambientale che gi diventat criticit economica e sociale svegliatevi interviene andrea liberati presidente del circolo di terni di legambiente allumbria una volta portate a termine quelle gi in avanzato stato di realizzazione non mancheranno le strade gi oggi abbiamo autostrade strade statali regionali e provinciali in numero superiore alla media nazionale e doppio rispetto alle altre regioni dellitalia centrale occorrono invece progetti seri di viabilit sostenibile che riducano la mobilit allinterno della regione puntando sul trasporto ferroviario
1843013 legambiente ha sempre sostenuto prioritario e urgente conclude vanessa pallucchi presidente di legambiente umbria rivedere responsabilmente il modello di sviluppo della regione considerare fondamentale la cultura del limite e della sostenibilit sul versante delluso delle risorse naturali che sono il vero volano per lunico sviluppo possibile le strade le automobili i camion che consumano energia surriscaldano il pianeta non hanno futuro e consumano il futuro delle nuove generazioni e della nostra terra dobbiamo cambiare subito ora lumbria deve puntare sul trasporto su rotaia e su quello pubblico per liberare le nostre strade e risanare le nostre citt trasformate in tante camere a gas sempre sullorlo della chiusura per malaria da oggi in poi ogni idea di sviluppo deve essere subordinata al miglioramento della qualit dellambiente e della vita dei cittadini
1843014 questo quello che accadr nellumbria sottolinea la presidente di legambiente vanessa pallucchi che esce da dieci anni di ricostruzione post terremoto che ha visto il recupero di gran parte del patrimonio storico ed abitativo chiediamoci invece perch dalla ricostruzione non si sia passati alla rivitalizzazione delle nostre citt il problema risiede probabilmente in come esse siano state pianificate con uno sviluppo caotico e non qualitativo che ha condizionato anche socialmente il valore identitario che le zone storiche hanno per i cittadini i centri storici delle nostre medie citt sono assediate dal traffico aggiunge pallucchi dai costi eccessivi delle case dalla carenza di servizi sociali e commerciali tutti limiti reali che vanno superati con specifici incentivi legati ad esempio alla casa ed ad una pianificazione sociale e commerciale seria che abbia come valore di fondo la qualit
1843015 altro che deroghe conclude la presidente di legambiente umbria i comuni devono darsi regole che abbiano come condizione primaria la qualit dello sviluppo complessivo che si vuole dare alla citt fatta di centro periferie e aree a servizi che si integrano e che vengono pianificate e gestite come un sistema unico altrimenti potremmo entrare nel paradosso del costruttore che recupera il palazzo storico e riceve come premialit edificatoria la possibilit di costruire un bel centro commerciale nelle zone urbane in espansione per questo legambiente chiede che il disegno di legge venga profondamente rivisto ridimensionato nel ruolo centrale che viene dato al recupero edilizio e sappia invece dare una risposta alle istanze culturali sociali ed economiche dei cittadini e degli imprenditori che nel centro storico vogliono tornarci a vivere

1843019 siamo sconcertati dichiara vanessa pallucchi presidente di legambiente umbria non ci aspettavamo un attacco cos grave e pesante nei confronti della nostra associazione invece di trovare soluzioni ad un problema che tutti conoscevano sindaci arpa e provincia quello della fragilit della rete fognaria in caso di sovraccarico si accusa legambiente di aver effettuato i monitoraggi in modo improprio e di aver arrecato un grave danno allimmagine del trasimeno
1843020 il monitoraggio di goletta dei laghi continua vanessa pallucchi dimostra che per il pi importante bacino umbro il meno profondo ditalia se le piogge sono vitali in termini di ricambio idrico dal punto di vista microbiologico diventano un problema specialmente se abbondanti le precipitazioni del 7 e 8 giugno a passignano e tuoro hanno raggiunto i 3 centimetri giornalieri creando problemi di tenuta alla rete fognaria in tutta larea alte le concentrazioni dunque di coliformi fecali che hanno reso inquinati il 100 dei nostri prelievi a differenza dello scorso anno quando legambiente aveva registrato una buona situazione igienico sanitaria
1843021 i tecnici del laboratorio mobile di goletta dei laghi spiega stefano ciafani responsabile scientifico nazionale di legambiente hanno misurato le concentrazioni di coliformi e streptococchi fecali batteri spia della pressione antropica previsti dalla legge italiana dpr 470 82 a cui sono stati aggiunti gli escherichia coli parametro stabilito dalla direttiva europea 2006 7 ce che litalia dovr recepire entro il 2008 lungi dal volere attribuire patenti di balneabilit che resta un compito esclusivo di asl e arpa i dati di legambiente rappresentano una istantanea scattata al momento del prelievo che ha lobiettivo di stimolare lattenzione delle amministrazioni locali sui problemi del lago
1843022 larpa umbria sostiene che il metodo usato per il nostro monitoraggio non attendibile
1843023 siamo convinti che la qualit del lago trasimeno stia a cuore a tutti non solo a legambiente ma anche agli operatori turistici ai sindaci alla provincia e ai cittadini conclude la presidente di legambiente umbria la salvaguardia dellimmagine del trasimeno necessita politiche serie di gestione allora perch delegittimare la campagna di legambiente invece di cercare soluzioni ai problemi

1843026 non accettabile un comportamento del genere dal sindaco che ha il dovere morale di confrontarsi con tutti i cittadini anche quelli che eventualmente non lo hanno votato o che comunque in qualsiasi occasione avessero unopinione diversa continua la paciotto il punto di vista e le legittime preoccupazioni delle associazioni e dei comitati meritano quella capacit di ascolto che assieme al libero voto sono il sale della democrazia e entrambe necessarie
1843027 evidentemente il nostro impegno e il nostro contributo non considerato utile da questa amministrazione vista la sufficienza e larroganza con cui siamo stati trattati assieme alle altre associazioni e cittadini conclude con amarezza la rappresentante di legambiente
1843028 certamente la qualit della vita in una citt come spoleto nettamente migliore se paragonata a citt pi grandi o di analoghe dimensioni devastate da abusivismo rifiuti e inquinamento come succede purtroppo in molte citt del sud dichiara vanessa pallucchi presidente di legambiente umbria una citt come spoleto che non paga il prezzo di storici e tragici svantaggi merita unattenzione particolare
1843029 uno scenario troppo ricorrente con una gestione incoerente e contraddittoria dichiara marco pippi responsabile acque di legambiente umbria che non pone soluzioni nemmeno a fronte dei casi estremi come nel caso delle citate e tardive ordinanze di sospensione degli attingimenti irrigui che frequentemente eluse anche per la carenza dei controlli in grave ritardo anche il risanamento dellintera filiera dellacqua che non punta sul efficace ed il risparmio risparmio con reti idropotabili e sistemi di irrigazione ormai obsoleti energivori e climalteranti visto che la quasi totalit dei strumenti di pompaggio sono azionati da potenti motori diesel
1843030 occorrono maggiori controlli continua marco pippi migliorare i sistemi di irrigazione ma anche puntare su unagricoltura di qualit e meno idrovora

1843032 beer pong is a virtual rendition of the popular college drinking game that requires players to toss ping pong balls across a table and into a cup of beer if your cup is hit you drink

1843173 it is easier and cheaper to modify and maintain 76 planes than to keep all 94 up and running
1843174 due to the age of the aircraft we have a lot of electrical problems and cabin pressure problems old wires rub together and short out causing system malfunctions and component failures
1843175 there are some jobs which take a long time to work
1843176 due to different modifications the aircraft has had over the years the wiring diagrams get confusing
1843177 corrosion and wear and tear have turned over half of germanys c 160 transall planes into decrepit machinery the sources apparently said that it was becoming more difficult to locate spare parts for the planes some of which are more than 40 years old germany had originally planned to replace the remaining transall planes with airbus new a400m model by 2014 but that schedule may have to be revised due to recently announced delays in delivery
1843178 one c 130e hercules from the 86th airlift wing at ramstein air base germany is so old and in such bad shape it cannot safely fly
1843179 air force secretary michael wynne speaking at a washington think tank sept
1843180 they do a great job keeping these planes flying but the challenge with this kind of operational tempo is we dont yet know what kind of toll all the fine dust in iraq will take on all the connectors and parts in our airplanes when we fly these long missions in hot climates you can get a kind of chronic heat effect on the pieces and parts of the aircraft
1843181 at 23 years of age our aircraft are older than we have ever seen in our united states air force jumper said

1843194 the obama people are perfectly happy to have our support but their attitude seems to be we can win without you and i guess thats why none of us is going from rah rah hillary to rah rah obama
1843195 barack obama his campaign and his supporters have not been shy to signal their disdain for bill clinton and his accomplishments
1843196 barack obama may be the fresh face in this years presidential election but nearly half say theyre already tired of hearing about him a poll says with election day still three months away 48 percent said theyre hearing too much about the democratic candidate according to a poll released wednesday by the nonpartisan pew research center just 26 percent said the same about his republican rival john mccain
1843197 barack obama may be the fresh face in this years presidential election but nearly half say theyre already tired of hearing about him a poll says
1843198 and while hillary has agreed not to have her name placed in nomination that concession has yet to yield a definitive answer on what exactly her role will be in denver
1843199 i think obama is mentally ill it astounds me that he thinks he is invincible that he and he alone is going to save our nation

1843205 the same old folks doing the same old things talking the same old stuff
1843206 the clinton campaign issued an official response to the growing tempest but the statement from campaign manager maggie williams did not respond to the central question of whether staffers circulated the photo
1843207 obamas advantage is attributable largely to overwhelming support from two traditional democratic constituencies african americans and hispanics
1843208 sure but thats what they said about the clintons so you must just playing the race card once more
1843209 geez how come all of your stuff is so expensive jobs

1843461 we got feedback from audience and we were able to course correct
1843462 were done by writing the show at end of february so theres not an opportunity to get any feedback which quite frankly scares the sh t out of us
1843463 this is the year that links us to the past and the present we knew what we wanted to do for a long time the challenge for us is how to make this engaging and exciting where everybody is really excited about the final season of lost
1843464 the people that are off the island the island seems to be drawing them back and ben michael emerson makes it clear they need to go back to the island
1843465 so hopefully thats a lot of what youll see of in season 5 the journey how those six return to the island
1843466 the worst thing we can do on the show is be boring
1843467 if you dont want something to be heard dont say it
1843468 the victims courage and tenacity prevented her from being further victimized and should serve as a role model for anybody else who find themselves in similar circumstances
1843469 he could only be accurately characterized as a cowardly weasel only fit for jail because there is nowhere else we can put him
1843470 if the allegations against perez are true and we have every reason to believe they are he could only be accurately characterized as a cowardly weasel only fit for jail because there is nowhere else we can put him
1843471 like the opportunistic parasitical predator that he is he seized the opportunity to take advantage of her trust and steal her innocence
1843472 the victims courage and tenacity prevented her from being further victimized and should serve as a role model for anybody else who find themselves in similar circumstances

1843487 imo tmbtc was exploring the science vs faith theme better than any other episode on the level of the narrative the dharma initiatives rationalist positivist approach to the islands special phenomena clashed with the world view of the hostiles jacob which seems more spiritual or at least one that regards dis work as limited and possibly dangerous
1843488 tmbtc is good but no way at the level of ltda tmbtc has a huge flaw that showed the writers were making some things up as they went along ben shooting locke as we now see has no relevance on the story and we can obviously tell that the writers changed their mind on going that direction

1843521 der postmoderne imperialismus hat zwei komponenten die erste ist der freiwillige imperialismus der globalen konomie er wird normalerweise von einem internationalen konsortium durch internationale finanzinstitutionen wie iwf und weltbank ausge bt die zweite dimension des postmodernen imperialismus k nnte der imperialismus des nachbarn genannt werden instabilit t in der nachbarschaft stellt eine gefahr dar die kein staat ignorieren kann politische misswirtschaft ethnische gewalt und kriminalit t auf dem balkan stellen eine gefahr f r europa dar die antwort hierauf war eine art freiwilliges un protektorat im kosovo und in bosnien zu schaffen

1843523 die herausforderung der postmodernen welt ist es mit der idee doppelter standards klarzukommen unter uns gehen wir auf der basis von gesetzen und offener kooperativer sicherheit um aber wenn es um traditionellere staaten au erhalb des postmodernen kontinents europa geht m ssen wir auf die raueren methoden einer vergangenen ra zur ckgreifen gewalt pr ventive angriffe irref hrung was auch immer n tig ist um mit denen klarzukommen die immer noch im 19 jahrhundert leben in dem jeder staat f r sich selber stand unter uns halten wir uns an das gesetz aber wenn wir im dschungel operieren m ssen wir ebenfalls das gesetz des dschungels anwenden

1843553 ich hatte angst dass der transfer platzt unser pr sident ist etwas verr ckt
1843554 seit montag hat sich die sache noch drei bis viermal gedreht weil der pr sident neue nicht nachvollziehbare aspekte forderte
1843555 wir haben die option sofort gezogen das ist damit ein vierjahres vertrag ein kompletter kauf fragen sie mich nicht nach diesem modell sondern herrn driss f r uns hat es keine wirtschaftlichen nachteile aber es war teilweise richtig nervend
1843556 chermiti ist schnell spielt aggressiv geht im strafraum hin wo es weh tut er hat eine ausgepr gte pers nlichkeit und wei was er will

1843568 shes right about those two little words ask permission and not about dumbing down code
1843569 a little something about dumbing code down to the lowest common denominator
1843570 if we give people the liberty to act in what they perceive to be their self interest the few will enslave the many
1843571 lowest common denominator design is a sure road to dumbed down content deprived interfaces that feature themselves lcdd is based at its heart on contempt for users and for content
1843572 instead assume that users are smarter about the content at hand than interface designers such is often empirically the case thus the best that design usually can do is to get out of the way and at least do no harm

1843589 anzeichen daf r dass die bald stattfindenden anschl ge den anschl gen vom 11 september gleichkommen oder diese gar an h rte bertreffen werden und es ist ziemlich eindeutig dass dabei die hauptstadt und die stadt new york auf jeglicher liste stehen werden
1843590 sie fragen mich ob die lage ernst sei ja darauf k nnen sie ihr leben verwetten menschen tun so etwas nicht es sei denn die situation ist ernst
1843591 glaubw rdige recherchen deuten darauf hin dass al qaida die pl ne zur durchf hrung eines gro angelegten anschlages in den vereinigten staaten fortf hrt um unseren demokratischen prozess zum erliegen zu bringen dies sind ern chternde informationen ber diejenigen die uns schaden wollen aber mit jedem tag werden wir st rker in der sicherheit unserer nation
1843592 der feind der uns am 11 september traf ist getroffen und schwach aber immer noch t dlich und immer noch bereit uns wieder zu treffen
1843593 ein neuer anschlag wie der am 11 september k nnte beides liefern eine rechtfertigung und eine m glichkeit vergeltungsschl ge gegen einige bekannte ziele durchzuf hren
1843594 ein terroristisches ereignis mit hoher schadenswirkung wird irgendwo in der westlichen welt geschehen vielleicht auch in den vereinigten staaten dieses wird unsere bev lkerung dazu bringen unsere verfassung in frage zu stellen und unser land zu militarisieren damit eine wiederholung eines weiteren todesopfer fordernden ereignisses verhindert wird
1843595 wir k nnten ein us amerikanisches schiff in guantanamo bay in die luft jagen und kuba die schuld daran in die schuhe schieben
1843596 wir k nnten eine kubanische kommunistische terrorkampagne in der gegend um miami und anderen st dten in florida oder sogar in washington organisieren
1843597 opferlisten in us amerikanischen tageszeitungen k nnten dazu beitragen in der bev lkerung eine nationale welle der emp rung loszutreten
1843598 um bei einem erneuten terroristischen angriff auf die usa wie dem vom 11 september gut ger stet zu sein
1843599 der feind der uns am 11 september traf ist getroffen und schwach
1843600 eine rechtfertigung und eine m glichkeit vergeltungsschl ge gegen einige bekannte ziele durchzuf hren

1843629 paul has done a track about how he feels about heather and what was going on with the paparazzi because no one has heard his side of it at all so this will be the first time anyone hears a song relating to that subject its a very emotional and very powerful song
1843630 what the song shows is that rather than feeling embittered towards heather paul just feels sorry for her
1843631 paul knows heather is a complex person and deeply misunderstood but that she has hardly helped herself by being less than transparent about her life
1843632 hey jackass why dont you stop with all the fucking swearing this a mother fucking church after all

1843649 im m rz 1985 unterzeichnete pr sident reagan die national security decision directive 166 durch welche eine verst rkte milit rische unterst tzung der mudschaheddin genehmigt wurde und welche ebenfalls die neuen ziele des geheimen krieges in afghanistan offenbarte den sieg ber die sowjetischen truppen in afghanistan durch verdeckte aktionen sowie den r ckzug der sowjets aus afghanistan
1843650 mit unterst tzung der vereinigten staaten wurden durch den pakistanischen diktator general zia ul haq tausende religi ser schulen erbaut die sich zu keimzellen der taliban entwickelten
1843651 weder ich noch meine br der konnten hinweise f r eine amerikanische hilfe erkennen
1843652 die beziehungen zwischen der isi und der cia waren durch die von general zia durchgef hrte amtsenthebung bhuttos und die implementierung des milit rregimes immer intensiver geworden pakistans haltung war in weiten teilen des afghanistankrieges sehr antisowjetisch gepr gt mehr als dies jemals in den usa der fall gewesen war schon kurz nach der sowjetischen invasion in afghanistan im jahr 1980 schickte zia ul haq seinen isi chef los um die sowjetischen republiken in zentralasien zu destabilisieren die cia stimmte diesem vorhaben erst im oktober 1984 zu sowohl pakistan als auch die vereinigten staaten nahmen im bezug auf afghanistan in der ffentlichkeit die rolle von verhandelnden partnern ein w hrend man sich im hintergrund darauf einigte dass eine milit rische eskalation der weg der wahl sein sollte hierbei gingen die usa aber wesentlich vorsichtiger vor als pakistan
1843653 das grenzgebiet zwischen pakistan und afghanistan zur weltweit bedeutendsten region bez glich der heroinproduktion avancierte und 60 des bedarfes am amerikanischen markt abdeckte
1843654 das kapital der cia kontrollierte ebenfalls diesen heroinhandel als die guerillas der mudschaheddin regionen afghanistans besetzten wiesen sie die dort ans ssigen bauern an opium als eine art revolution re steuer anzubauen jenseits der grenze in pakistan unterhielten afghanische anf hrer und einheimische syndikate unter dem schutz des pakistanischen geheimdienstes hunderte heroinlabore in diesem jahrzehnt des offenen drogenhandels konnten keinerlei bedeutsame durchsuchungen oder verhaftungen durch die u s drug enforcement agency us amerikanische drogenverfolgungsbeh rde in islamabad durchgesetzt werden
1843655 als katalysator des zerfalls der sowjetunion und der entstehung sechs neuer muslimischer republiken in zentralasien
1843656 die kontrolle ber die trainingscamps in afghanistan in die h nde der jui
1843657 die h lfte der truppen und der ausr stung der taliban aus pakistan und den best nden der isi stammt en
1843658 weit ber die versorgung der tschetschenen mit waffen und fachwissen hinausgeht die isi und ihre radikalen islamischen vertreter bestimmen den verlauf dieses krieges
1843659 im jahr 1994 organisierte die pakistanische isi f r basayev und seine treuen offiziere eine intensive islamische indoktrination und ein training in guerillakriegsf hrung im camp amir muawia in der provinz khost in afghanistan dieses camp wurde in den fr hen 1980er jahren von der cia und der isi gegr ndet und von dem ber chtigten afghanischen kriegsherrn gulbuddin hekmatyar geleitet im juli 1994 wurde basayev nach absolvierung des camps amir muawia nach markaz i dawar gebracht einem camp in pakistan wo er sich einem training in fortgeschrittener guerillataktik unterzog hier traf er auch auf die hochrangigsten pakistanischen milit r und geheimdienstoffiziere verteidigungsminister general aftab shahban mirani innenminister general naserullah babar sowie den leiter der isi abteilung zur unterst tzung islamischer angelegenheiten general javed ashraf mittlerweile alle pensioniert diese verbindungen auf h chster ebene sollten sich bald als sehr n tzlich f r basayev erweisen
1843660 tschetschenische kriegsherren damit immobilien im kosovo mittels mehrerer immobilienunternehmen die zur vertuschung in jugoslawien angemeldet waren aufzukaufen
1843661 1995 nach tschetschenien zu den mudschaheddin kam die damals von ibn ul khattab angef hrt wurden er begann den tschetschenischen mudschaheddin unterricht ber die lehren des islam der richtigen aqeedah zu geben da viele ungenaue und verzerrte vorstellungen hier ber kursierten
1843662 diese wahhabiten gruppen sind eine kleine aber sehr gut situierte und ausger stete minderheit mit ihren anschl gen verfolgen sie das ziel den terror in die herzen der massen zu tragen sie verbreiten anarchie und gesetzlosigkeit und setzen auf diese weise ihre eigene form eines brutalen und intoleranten islam durch solche gruppen vertreten nicht die vorherrschende meinung der meisten gl ubigen muslime und islam gelehrten ber den islam denn f r diese ist der islam das beispiel f r eine vorbildliche gesellschaft und eine perfekte moral die wahhabiten sind nichts anderes als eine anarchistische bewegung unter islamischer flagge sie wollen aber keinen islamischen staat schaffen sondern einen zustand der verwirrung in dem sie gut und erfolgreich leben k nnen
1843663 pakistan hat den rebellengruppen in lashkar und jaish mittels seines geheimdienstes isi geldmittel waffen trainingseinrichtungen und hilfe bei der grenz berschreitung zur verf gung gestellt
1843664 ja aus den kreisen der exil pakistani und kashmirer in england kamen millionen von dollar pro jahr und auch von den sympathisanten der wahhabiten am persischen golf kam unterst tzung
1843665 ja der anf hrer der harakat farooq kashmiri khalil unterzeichnete 1998 die erkl rung osama bin ladens mit der zu angriffen auf amerikaner auch zivilisten und deren verb ndeten aufgerufen wurde bin laden steht us amerikanischen und indischen beh rden zufolge au erdem unter verdacht die jaish finanziert zu haben ausserdem reiste der gr nder der jaish maulana massoud azhar mehrere male zu treffen mit bin laden nach afghanistan
1843666 viele von ihnen nahmen an den gleichen ideologischen trainingseinheiten oder muslimischen seminaren in den madrasas teil wie die taliban oder die ausl ndischen s ldner in afghanistan ihre milit rische ausbildung erhielten sie in afghanischen camps oder in d rfern im pakistanisch kontrollierten kaschmir erst k rzlich wurden etliche neue madrasas in azad kaschmir durch extremistengruppen errichtet
1843667 verl ssliche quellen berichten dass die vereinigten staaten nun 1994 aktiv an der aufr stung und dem training der muslimischen truppen bosnien herzegowinas teilhaben dies steht im direkten widerspruch zu den vereinbarungen der vereinten nationen us organe lieferten waffen die in china prc nordkorea dprk und iran hergestellt wurden dieselben quellen deuteten an dass iran unter kenntnis und billigung der usa die bosnische armee mit einer gro en anzahl mehrfachraketenwerfer und einer beachtlichen menge an munition belieferte diese lieferungen beinhalteten 107mm und 122mm raketen aus der volksrepublik china sowie vbr 230 mehrfachraketenwerfer aus iran au erdem sollen 400 mitglieder der iranischen revolutionsgarde pasdaran iranian revolutionary guard pasdaran mit gro en mengen an waffen und munition nach bosnien gekommen sein es wurde angenommen dass die cia hiervon umfassende kenntnis hatte und dass sie davon ausging dass einige dieser 400 pasdaran mitglieder f r zuk nftige terroranschl ge in westeuropa eingesetzt w rden die us regierung hat ihre beteiligung an dem heimlichen versto gegen das un waffenembargo bisher in keinster weise eingeschr nkt des weiteren wurden innerhalb der letzten zwei jahre vor 1994 drei hochrangige delegationen entsandt um die jugoslawische regierung auf amerikanischen kurs zu bringen jedoch vergeblich damit ist jugoslawien der einzige staat der region der sich dem druck der usa nicht beugt
1843668 dazu beigetragen zu haben in bosnien eine basis f r militante islamisten geschaffen zu haben
1843669 am bedenklichsten f r die sfor mission und was noch wichtiger ist f r die sicherheit des amerikanischen personals welches in bosnien dient ist wahrscheinlich die weigerung der clinton regierung dem kongress und dem amerikanischen volk gegen ber zuzugeben welche rolle die usa bei der lieferung von waffen aus iran an die muslimische regierung in sarajevo spielten
1843670 eine zentrale rolle bei der drastischen zunahme des iranischen einflusses in bosnien
1843671 ehemaligen sowie sich noch im dienst befindlichen mitgliedern der 22 sas gro britanniens 22 spezial luftwaffenregiment sowie drei privaten britischen und amerikanischen sicherheitsunternehmen anvertraut wurde
1843672 bin laden selbst war schon in albanien gewesen er war einer unter etlichen fundamentalistengruppen die einheiten in den kosovo zum kampf entsendet hatten man nimmt an dass bin laden 1994 eine operation in albanien auf die beine gestellt haben soll albanischen quellen zufolge hatte der damalige pr sident sali berisha verbindungen zu organisationen die sich im nachhinein als extrem fundamentalistisch herausgestellt hatten
1843673 was der ffentlichkeit gr tenteils verschwiegen wurde war die tatsache dass die u k einen teil ihres budgets aus dem drogenhandel bezog
1843674 das us au enministerium f hrte die u k als terroristische vereinigung mit dem hinweis dass diese ihre operationen mit mitteln aus dem internationalen heroinhandel und krediten von islamischen staaten und einzelpersonen unter ihnen wahrscheinlich auch osama bin laden durchf hrte

1843714 i think that the whole thing is overwhelming from the moment that you see your first sonogram i think that its just an experience that you cant describe until you go through it and then all of a sudden when the baby is born you know that emotion and that feeling that you get responsibility and being proud and excited you know just there are not words that really describe it and then you sort of get initiated into a club its an elite club and only people who are parents can understand it and are a part of it and its very special its a lot of hard work
1843715 i dont think i can love him like i used to anymore i cannot believe all of this why hasnt he said anything about the baby still its so weird people know just say something

1843747 i think the tone is very real but the relationships in the movie are where we try to draw our comedy from
1843748 i think its somewhere in a true lies type world almost with big exciting action but the relationships are all very personal and thats where a lot of the comedy comes from
1843749 four foot long dreadlocks im going for a george clinton type look with this i dont think anyone will be pissed off about that either
1843750 the reason the joker worked is because hes insane and batman is also crazy you need someone who is more than evil anyone who saw tommy lee jones as the cackling lunatic knows that
1843751 ideally you want another movie with heath without him catwoman but really think that one through give her a new take
1843752 catwoman needs to be part of it thats even more obvious now that hes living on the other side of life
1843753 it would be fun to see them put a spin on a less obvious one like they did with ras al ghul
1843754 catwoman s such a powerful and sexual and strong woman and i like that but god i hope not as frank millers version of her as a prostitute thats the worst part of year one thats just frank trying to be outrageous it didnt ring remotely true to me
1843755 id like to see catwoman over the penguin not as a prostitute and not as the tim burton version what cats sniffed her back to life but perhaps the adam hughes design with the goggles thats very realistic i can imagine her in street clothes that are designed just right i also like the idea of them creating villains just for the movies
1843756 theres a great story to be told of the triangle between bruce batman and selena catwoman i love writing her she plays with him like a ball of yarn shes the only one that makes him all rigid when he talks to her
1843757 i would pick the calendar man julian gregory day long halloween and dark victory happen to be my favorite collections hes not an iconic character but he means a lot to me im called the calender man on the coheed and cambria tour bus because im always on time but hes more like a hannibal lector figure
1843758 at one point batman had a therapist hugo strange who was actually a great villain
1843759 when hugo strange found out about batmans identity through analysis he drugs him and takes over his identity
1843760 unless maybe he just has a skin condition it would be weird though riddler could work as well
1843761 characters like catwoman riddler and hugo strange make sense because theyre counterpoints to batmans psychosis and fears the joker creates chaos two face shows the duality of the batman bruce wayne relationship and how batmans found peace with that duality batman searches for answers and the riddler has questions batman is driven and catwoman is sexual they play well against each other and challenge aspects of what makes a hero
1843762 well thats the last that ill be voicing plastic man in my life
1843763 ive been on the wrong side i dont want to be a sleazebag any more i can stretch im going to have fun and be on the good guys side

1843767 even president bush who signed scores of death warrants as texas governor concurred some time ago that the united states must honor its international obligations in this case
1843768 there will be no clearer sign that texas will have gone beyond the pale than if jose medellins execution goes forward

1843779 okay and then secondly dave i am curious about your reactions to the observation particularly given some increased pace of movement within tobacco but outside the cigarette category that you are not moving more aggressively with respect to moist smokeless tobacco and particular and perhaps snus the the test market i think in atlanta of moist smokeless started last october its almost the year ago its really has an expanded materially and i just wonder the outside perception is there is a lack of urgency on those types of efforts because you are not moving it would appear with great speed so i am just curious about your reaction that observation
1843780 yes and out of it not characterize it as a lack of urgency i would characterize it as and we want to make sure that we do this in a financially disciplined way and when i say financially disciplined that we go out we have tested all elements of the overall value equation behind both snus and with snuff and we got it completely right then we wont incorporate that into our plans and right now both of those initiatives are investment spent for us and our goal is to take it from investment spend to being making a profit but right we are in these test markets are what i call burning laboratories and make sure we get it right

1843837 this study illustrates the impact flossing can have on oral health the twins experimental model is a powerful tool to help sort out genetic and environmental factors that often confound the interpretation of treatment studies this study demonstrates that flossing can have an important and favorable impact on an individual as compared to that of a non flossing individual with similar genetics and possibly similar habits
1843838 twins tend to share the same or similar environmental factors such as dietary habits health and life practices as well as genetics in this case the only difference was flossing and the outcome was significant flossing may significantly reduce the amount of bad bacteria in the mouth

1843887 statistical analysis shows it to be nearly inconceivable that sony made all its playstations without using congolese coltan
1843888 sony and other companies like it have the benefit of plausible deniability because the coltan ore trades hands so many times from when it is mined to when sony gets a processed product that a company often has no idea where the original coltan ore came from and frankly dont care to know

1843896 but i will say that he was the best partner in the history of sports broadcasting he was just awesome there might have been some that were just as good but nobody was better
1843897 he had so many wonderful offers from other teams through the years but he would never go because this is where he wanted to be he loved atlanta loved doing the braves when he got here nobody knew who he was
1843898 and he was very proud of the fact he made it on his own here

1843912 this is much more than just an ad campaign its a brand campaign because it speaks to what the core of jetblue is its executable across every touch point for crew members and customers
1843913 aviation is a particularly tough industry right now but we definitely see a place for optimism in the parts that we control like our customer service and our product happy jetting captures the approach and attitude to service of our more than 12 000 crewmembers so if even the best laid travel plans go awry happy jetting is about how we deal with them and how we find solutions
1843914 jetblue is a brand that has been built on great customer experience and word of mouth about that experience happy jetting is an idea that transcends advertising it is a way of capturing that experience and articulating it across every conceivable medium

1843945 these are men and women who get up every single day and work hard to keep americas economic engine going
1843946 right now americas economy is not working west virginians are paying record prices for gasoline and groceries and struggling to make ends meet some of our transportation and trucking industries have had to scale back operations and in some cases cut jobs because of high fuel prices
1843947 from day one anne barth will work to lower gas prices by supporting responsible policies that work for west virginians
1843948 anne barth supports increasing responsible drilling cracking down on price gouging and speculation and using west virginia coal to help meet our energy needs coal must be a centerpiece of any national energy policy

1843952 hilary hated on you so that b ch is irrelevant
1843953 i am appalled that democrat lawmakers will not agree to these commonsense amendments
1843954 my son is currently serving in iraq to defend our state and nation from terrorists yet democrats will not do their part on the homefront to also defend us from such extremists
1843955 yet california democrats placed their radical political agenda ahead of citizens safety by refusing to prevent terrorists from teaching in our schools citizens should be outraged that these lawmakers are playing political games with our safety
1843956 would have required any person or organization seeking use of public school property to sign a statement of information declaring they do not advocate the overthrow of our government and are not part of an extremist terror network also any school employee discovered to be part of an extremist terror network could be fired
1843957 will allow communists to teach in public schools and use government property for their meetings
1843958 as we recognize the inherent danger in allowing communists those who seek the violent overthrow of our democratic republic access to the impressionable minds of young students
1843959 yet sb 1322 seeks to supersede the state constitution without voter approval and allow the government to employ individuals who want to destroy their employer
1843960 it really is shocking that at a time when america is still subject to attacks from radical terrorists and communist governments still terrorize their citizens california democrats wont stand up for us we have brave soldiers putting their lives on the line every day to defend us from such tyranny but democrats will not cast a simple vote to do the same here in california democrats are quick to side with the latest political cause championing the rights of the oppressed with their votes today democrats have missed their opportunity to make a statement denouncing oppressive communist governments responsible for the misery and suffering of so many worldwide
1843961 but the law also states that the property may not be used by anyone intent on overthrowing the government
1843962 sb 1322 would delete the requirement that an individual or organization wanting to use the school property is not a communist action organization or communist front organization
1843963 shes gone she aint ever coming back n its all your fault
1843964 as i look back on my lifes work i am probably most pround of having helped to create a company that by virtue of its values practices and success has had a tremendous impact on the way companies are managed around the world and im particularly proud that im leaving behind an ongoing organization that can live on as a role model long after im gone
1843965 list you are not allowed to smoke in here you are not allowed to take photographs you are not allowed to stand there you are not allowed to take your drink out give it a break man many clubs have become a rather annoying environment i have to admit
1843966 one may ask g d of course knows all that will transpire now before a particular deed was done did g d know whether the person will be righteous or wicked or did he not know if he knew that the person would be righteous then it was not possible for that person not to be so and if you say that he knew that the person would be righteous but it was also possible that he might be wicked than knowledge was not complete know that the answer to this question longer than the land is its measure and broader than the sea and that many great foundations and lofty mountains hang upon it but understand well what i am going to say we have already explained in the second chapter of the laws of the torahs foundations that g d does not know with a mind that is distinct from his being as is the case with man whose being and mind are two distinct entities rather he and his mind are one and the same a concept that is impossible for the human mind to fully comprehend thus just as man cannot discover and grasp the truth of the creator as it is written no man can perceive me and live so too man cannot discover and grasp the mind of the creator in the words of the prophet my thoughts are not as your thoughts nor are your ways as my my ways therefore we lack the capacity to know the nature of knowledge of all creations and all events but this we know without doubt that the deeds of man are in his hands and g d does not compel him to do anything
1843967 the author did not act in the manner of the wise one ought not begin something that one is incapable of concluding he begins by posing a difficult question then remains with the difficulty and reverts to faith it would have been better for him to have left it as a matter of faith for the innocent instead of making them aware of the contradiction and leaving their minds in doubt
1843968 like the predictions of the stargazers who know by some other means what the behavior of an individual will be
1843969 there is no contradiction in the first place knowledge of the future is the result of his observing the deed that the person is doing just as a persons observation of the deeds of his fellow in no way compels his fellows actions so too is it with observation of ones deeds one cannot argue that because g d knows the future actions of man he therefore compels them since before him there is no precedence and subsequence as he is not governed by the laws of time there is no future in reality the whole of time is present to him so just as our knowledge of the present has no compelling effect so too his knowledge is always in his present and non compelling
1843970 indeed this is consistent with the conclusion of the raavad who compares knowledge to that of a stargazer
1843971 all existences aside of the creator from the highest spiritual form to a tiny gnat in the belly of the earth all exist by virtue of his reality so in knowing his own reality he knows everything
1843972 g d is aware of his own reality and knows it as it is
1843973 thus he does not know the creations by perceiving them as we know them but rather he knows then through his perception of himself by knowing himself he knows everything since everything relates to him for its very being
1843974 thought and knowledge of all created beings embrace in actuality each and every creation for this knowledge itself is its very life and being and that which brings it into existence from nothingness into actuality
1843975 if you fail how do you affect him if your sins are many what do you do to him if you are righteous what do you give him what can he possibly receive from you
1843976 confining to his infinite and feature free essence assuming definitive attributes by which to relate to us on our terms
1843977 sky for height the breadth of the earth and the deep who can trace them out
1843978 something of an answer for it fails to resolve the contradiction as it pertains to the essence of knowledge the raavad therefore feels that maimonides ought not to have begun discussion of an issue that ultimately extends beyond the parameters of logic

1844005 in many ways the opening ceremony sets the tone for the two weeks of competion and celebration that will follow

1844220 andy warhol is an overrated hack who needs to just die already
1844221 im just a businessman i provide what the audience wants
1844222 enough is enough now is the time to move away from our lesser selves now is the time to stop making money on the misfortunes of others and the prurient and salacious desires of the public now is the time to admit and recognize that we arent just businessmen but the guardians of the human spirit with a responsibility to the health of this nation that we can lift this country up with our programming that instead of catering to the gossips and the scolds and the voyeurs we can appeal to the better nature in our audience the better nature of what this country is all about
1844223 pretty much no one at retro would agree to relocate at nintendos behest as asinine shenanigans are typically met with little fanfare

1844228 i know most of what you hear on the news about iraq is not usually good news and that so many are dying over here
1844229 that is true to an extent but it does not paint the total picture and violence is not everywhere throughout the country so please dont associate what you see on the news with all of iraq
1844230 all these images come up and it shocked him so he immediately stopped and notified the sheriffs department
1844231 was a wreck but he is organized when it comes to his video stuff
1844232 because of the number of images he had theres no way we could type up that many warrants
1844233 included a minor engaged in sexual activity and simulated sexual activity
1844234 did unlawfully have in his possession material that included a minor engaged in sexually provocative poses whereby the minor is nude or partially nude
1844235 at first we thought she was having a good time
1844236 but then quite hit the ground as if lightnting struck we were all in shock and then we looked up only to see brace wielding a bat over her with a wide eyed yet placid look on her face
1844237 everything was sort of hazy and unrezzed it was like i was hovering above my body i thought i was dying
1844238 im not turning her in brace is wild and crazy and sets fear into my heart i tremble at the mere mention of her name no way man
1844239 finally someone had the courage to do it x d
1844240 she had a bunch of meetings and things planned including meetings for her own line but shes postponed everything shes completely thrilled this is something shes wanted for a very long time

1844243 hi i like have this blog can i um take pictures
1844244 instruments that tend to stay at a given station for a long time if the data recorder was older such this as mirrored raid wouldnt be a part of it and indeed a single disk failure could render the process void
1844245 am i correct that when you changed the program to account for the missing 20 days in july there was a backward propagation of adjustments filling in for other missing days
1844246 you are good when i was at it i made another adjustment to the program i used to fit 4 harmonics sine cosine with frequencies 1 year through 4 year to describe the average seasonal cycle i changed that to 6 harmonics therefore there will be small systematic differences as a function of time of year in the de seasonalized trend that will be on top of adjustments caused by months in the past during which there were a number of missing days not symmetrically distributed during that month
1844247 now the same people that were blowing me off a year ago are calling me and saying ok i get it
1844248 people are being more socially conscious whether its global warming sustainability or landfills i think its an offshoot of the boomers wanting to leave a positive legacy
1844249 we strongly think any efforts to reduce the environmental impact of packaging must focus on all consumer goods and not just target one industry like bottled water
1844250 bring balanced positive and factual bottled water information to consumers and community leaders
1844251 i get the sense that theres a desire to vilify our industry and point to it as hurting the community
1844252 with all of the press and interest in bottled water waste we wanted to provide a solution
1844253 brita water plus nalgene gives you great healthy water with the convenience of being able to carry it around as well
1844254 this resonates with a lot of people because so many environmental issues are so big that people cant get their head around them
1844255 global warming is a good example how does someone make a change in their daily habits that lets them feel like theyre making a difference
1844256 based on the findings of the food and drug administration the environmental protection agency the american plastics council and other reliable sources from around the world we continue to firmly believe in the safety of our products

1844261 packaging up a previous nightmare to make room for the rest of your life wasntt easy
1844262 sometimes things need to be said and they need to be said because youre finally ready to say them
1844263 one act of violence doesnt equal 100 acts of kindness simply said easy to remember and why you need to get out i promised myself to let the process move at its own speed when i was ready i would ship off the old crap from the relationship nightmare that my ex created for me over 18 years i also realized part of what i needed was to make sure every person along the original route would finally know the truth whether it was via this blog or other means unlike my past eighteen years with him this would no longer be his continuous abusive surprise package the truth has been recently packaged on my terms because i was finally ready for everyone to know

1844284 he made us on purpose and he has a plan for our lives
1844285 no one is praying give me more to do were too busy to know gods plan for our lives
1844286 the reason why we dont know gods plan is that we have a casual relationship with him
1844287 god wants us to know his will more than we do
1844288 ive never seen anyone screw up their life trying to adopt the principles in gods word
1844289 god doesnt want our lip he wants our loyalty he wants our obedience
1844290 when i listen to the word of god and i walk in the ways of god i will discover the will of god
1844291 you will never know the will of god apart from the word of god

1844299 i was well convinced as were most technically trained people that the ipccs case for anthropogenic global warming agw is very tight however upon taking the time to get into the details of the science i was appalled at how flimsy the case really is
1844300 we dont have a whole lot of leads at this time
1844301 and when they had prayed the place in which they were gathered together was shaken and they were all filled with the holy spirit and continued to speak the word of god with boldness
1844302 do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a limited time that you may devote yourselves to prayer but then come together again so that satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self control
1844303 it says right here in black and white that we should go into our closet to pray
1844304 enter into thy closet and pray to thy father which is in secret
1844305 jesus was warning us against praying for the approval of others praying should never be about calling attention to ourselves it is about communing with god and experiencing his power and presence
1844306 the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few ask the lord of the harvest therefore to send out workers into his harvest field
1844307 i have no quarrel with law enforcement our police do their best at all times

1844312 we have about 80 to 110 kids a day hats off to everyone working the most important thing is that the kids are having fun
1844313 the cult of material possessions the cult of possessive love and the cult of power often lead people to attempt to play god to try to seize total control with no regard for the wisdom or the commandments that god has made known to us this is the path that leads towards death by contrast worship of the one true god means recognizing in him the source of all goodness that is the way to choose life

1844321 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared that this would become known
1844322 i appeal to both sides the russians and the jews for patient mutual understanding and admission of their own share of sin
1844323 insensitive to the russian people and disconnected from russian history
1844324 the ranks of the revolutionaries were certainly dominated by russians
1844325 the population of russia as a whole regarded the new revolutionary terror as a jewish terror
1844326 in 1918 at the time of the red terror ethnic minorities made up about 50 percent of the central staff of the cheka the secret police
1844327 the man who trashed orthodox christianity was yemelyan yaroslavsky a jew minei izrailevich gubelman
1844328 solzhenitsyn in fact is not anti semitic his books are not anti semitic and he is not in his personal relations anti jewish
1844329 at least he absolves himself of the taint of anti semitism
1844330 the preservation of the jewish people for more than two thousand years in diaspora arouses amazement and respect
1844331 however if we take a closer look in some periods this unity was achieved by the oppressive methods of the kagals jewish self governing bodies and one no longer knows if these methods should be respected simply because they stemmed from religious tradition at least for us russians even a small dose of such isolationism is treated as a repulsive fault
1844332 whats important is that alexander solzhenitsyn spent time in prison like millions of others
1844333 senator kennedy killed that girl the same as if he put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger
1844334 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia

1844348 he found that most charitable efforts are spearheaded by a tiny dedicated core of volunteers and are focused on assisting with the emergency needs of the poor for food clothing and shelter these volunteers do not deliver charity in a particularly holistic way and they do not engage in long term contact with the needy the advent of charitable choice has not changed these patterns

1844355 when it comes to young leaders its easy to look up to someone like you and want to be like you right now sometimes we lose focus on all of the cumulative life things that have made you into the person you are and to be in the ministry position that you are in it would be insightful to get a glimpse into your mid twenties to current you know what kinds of jobs you were working what major formative experiences did you have i think it would help young leaders look at someone like you and remember that there is much to be learned along the way and that generally having leadership positions like you have is something that is in our future instead of thinking that we should expect it now

1844372 if the jays dont trade a j this season and then he opts out is there a time limit for the two picks compensation for example if a j is not signed by anyone before the 09 season will jays lose the compensation
1844373 the question about losing the compensation seems somewhat hypothetical since that scenario has never happened before in this era excluding collusion where a free agent in the prime of his career has actually been snubbed past june of the following season

1844410 were already blending over the mandate right now ethanol is a lot cheaper than unleaded gasoline so everybody is going to be trying to expand and blend as much as they can so even if there is a waiver which really doesnt make much sense we still do not see the ethanol demand slowing down at all just because it is very price competitive
1844411 in terms of picking up demand the incremental supply thats scheduled to come online over say the next 12 months
1844412 yes we keep seeing new markets come in and as ethanol is 0 60 to 1 under unleaded gasoline more and more people keep blending it and using it
1844413 there is a lot of talk about the tariffs but logistically brazil is just not set up to handle and ship any more ethanol than they already are i mean we have the infrastructure issues we are very involved in the brazil infrastructure probably over the long term that can change but it also comes down to just a revenue issue doing away with the tariff its just less revenue in the united states because x amount of gallons will come to the united states one way or the other

1844420 the wii audience wont pay for a game as expensive as rock band
1844421 the wii version is undoubtedly the most important of rock bands skus why because games and most importantly third party games sell on the wii
1844422 in the first 18 months of the wiis life more third party games were sold on the wii
1844423 rock band 2 will do the best on the wii because the wii has sold more third party games than ps3 or the 360

1844429 it the treaty failed to recognize that the soviet union is gone and that russia is of course not our enemy
1844430 from our point of view and the un charter point of view it the war was illegal
1844431 the united states and other nato members have taken some actions along the way to lull the russians into acquiescence as nato expanded to include the former warsaw pact na tions the argument was that these countries wanted to join nato and that their membership posed no threat to russia that line prevailed as nato membership grew to include also estonia latvia and lithuania former republics of the soviet union now the russians see the same argument being advanced for georgia and ukraine thats getting close to home
1844432 it will probably soon be possible for the united states to destroy the long range nuclear arsenals of russia or china with a first strike

1844448 mccain made signifciant gains at obamas expense among some of what had been obamas strongest demographic groups
1844449 the survey results come as obama fresh off what had been characterized as a triumphant tour of the middle east and europe including a speech to 200 000 germans in berlin that trip quickly became fodder for an aggressive response ad by the mccain campaign that questioned whether obamas popularity around the world meant he was ready to lead the u s
1844450 the mccain camp seems to have turned lemons into lemonade huge crowds and mostly favorable press reviews of obamas overseas trip have been trumped by mccains attacks on obama loss of support for obama among young voters may also be due to his perceived reversals on issues they care about such as the war and government eavesdropping

1844458 assuming no dramatic change in economic trends we are planning for total sales growth in fiscal 2009 of 6 to 10 we expect comparable store sales growth of 1 to 5 and identical store sales growth of zero to 4
1844459 its cyclical in the sense as when the economy turns back up again and customers feel more financially secure we expect theyll probably return to previous purchasing patterns so well still have the value focus and we think that will position us better competitively for the long run but we do think customer purchasing patterns will evolve as the economy evolves
1844460 competition of course is a factor and as is cannibalization but they are not any more intense right now then they were in q2 or q1 so although we cant know for certain we think its reasonable to conclude that the deceleration in our comp store growth has primarily been due to the economy
1844461 looking back in 2001 the last slowdown you fared a lot better your comps were strong and the transactions were way up and i think at the time you posited that it was you were benefiting that the chain was benefiting from the trade down from restaurants so forth what do you think has changed do you think its either the economy is tougher or people shifting where theyre spending or do you think theres more competition for the kind of restaurant equivalent type food or close to equivalent type food that can be provided at other outlets
1844462 were not positive what it is we speculate two things that are different in 2008 from 2001 is one the oil prices are so high and gasoline is so expensive whole foods has always attracted because we have such unique and special stores weve always attracted a wider geographical radius then conventional supermarkets do people drive further to come to whole foods and we think that with the price of gasoline right now that people arent driving as far as frequently to our stores as they used to so we think on the margin thats hurting our comps secondly although we dont want to break it out i will say that the real estate markets that have been the hardest hit on the whole subprime mess we have felt that weve seen a greater slowdown in comps in those markets then we have in the markets that have been less affected so i think those two things are factors the price of oil i e gasoline and the markets that have particularly been hit hard by the housing downturn those have both affected whole foods comps

1844628 we are very excited to have the opportunity to acquire such a significant and well established group of companies in the state of colorado
1844629 our financial strength and ability to allocate capital during difficult market conditions allow us to make this strategic acquisition that we expect to generate significant future value for our shareholders
1844630 i am happy to announce the acquisition of our colorado operations by fnf
1844631 fnf is an exceptionally strong stable and well run title company its financial strength and operational acumen will allow our colorado operations to continue to provide the service and performance that our customers have come to expect for so many years we are thrilled to become a part of the fnf family
1844632 with the acquisition of these colorado operations we have become the market share leader in the state of colorado the impact title operating system is also a great component of the acquisition as these companies have effectively utilized that system for a number of years we welcome security title first american heritage title title america and united title and all of their employees into the fnf family and we are confident that our combined commitment to leading the title industry in customer service technology and financial strength will lead to a successful long term partnership that will set the standard for title insurers in the state of colorado
1844633 our online and on the ground strategy connects consumers with a world of useful neighborhood information real estate professionals who are area experts and best of all the home of their dreams delighting our customers is our top priority and we look forward to expanding our strategy into even more markets with even more top notch real estate agents
1844634 hitting the 1 000 agent mark is a real milestone for our business especially since were very selective and only hire experienced agents who represent a strong fit for our model our recruiting efforts focus on quality versus quantity and were also proud of our very low attrition rates in the unfortunate circumstance that we actually lose an agent it is rare that they leave us to join another real estate company we think this is a strong sign of the value proposition realestate com realtors provides our agents including a high volume of warm transferred customers great training and marketing systems as well as a lucrative commission plan
1844635 our survey reveals a wide gap between the perception homeowners have about their own homes value and the realities of a market in which three quarters of homes declined in value in the past year we attribute this gap to a combination of inattention and a fair bit of denial that causes people to believe their home is insulated from the woes of the market that affect others but not them
1844636 this sentiment is also carried through in homeowner confidence for the short term as more people expect their home to perform better in the next six months than the market and recent past although many homeowners may believe the worst is over we think this level of optimism is out of sync with actual market performance

1844646 pride indeed is the cardinal vice it swings open the door to most of the other theological vices and undermines the classical virtues of prudence courage and justice it thrives not on what one has but on what others do not have and even when one has diligently practiced the most admirable virtues there always lurks the danger that at some moment one will look in the mirror and say oh my what a wonderful person i am thus does the vice lunge from its hiding place
1844647 today about 10 of our revenue in composites results from wind energy sales
1844648 there is little doubt that use of glass fibre composites will continue to replace traditional materials like steel aluminum and wood as a lightweight non corrosive and affordable alternative the opportunities in this business have few limits
1844649 i mean year to date start to been about a million there were a little bit weaker in the second quarter so we would expect that the full year will probably come in less than a million and i think thats pretty consisting with consensus i mean just a note i think since consensus started keeping records thats the first time housing starts were been less than a million if this impact happens since 1959 when they started publishing these numbers so its bad out there the consensus seems to be that were going to continue to see this for another year and we might even see a second consecutive year less than a million we are certainly building our business plans as we go into our planning season here in the fall or not counting on the big market turnaround or to drive performance
1844650 were participating in a market that in total will grow at 1 5 to 2 times global gdp organically with some segments like wind energy that could grow high double digits for the coming decade
1844651 the typical buyer is older they have equity and theyre looking in part to diversify their portfolio so theyre looking for places to put their money

1844653 there are a few people that are purchasing with cash but not astronomically higher than in the past
1844654 anyone tied to the real estate industry right now is suffering through a little spill
1844655 these values are subject to change depending on quality control checks of the measured data but any revisions are expected to be small
1844656 march of the co2 i imagine they have been doing this all along whenever a strange data point emerges
1844657 so many adjustments that just happend to allways support the ones who makes them its not statistically possible and thus i find it hard to believe
1844658 this change also affected the entire record because there are missing days here and there
1844659 the reason was simply that we had a problem with the equipment for the first half of july with the result that the earlier monthly average consisted of only the last 10 days since co2 always goes down fast during july the monthly average came out low i have now changed the program to take this effect into account and adjusting back to the middle of the month using the multi year average seasonal cycle
1844660 we had a problem with the equipment for the first half of july with the result that the earlier monthly average consisted of only the last 10 days
1844661 what is interesting is that it happens within 24h after they release a result that shows a new record low for first 7 months
1844662 if there is an error and they notice it it must be corrected in the process it lookes like they found errors on every month at least for the last 4 years
1844663 the earlier monthly average consisted of only the last 10 days
1844664 how many of such adjustments happens to favour ipcc agw alarmists ideas i have never seen a single big adjustment done by the alarmists that does not end up being a support for their opinions never
1844665 this change also affected the entire record because there are missing days here and there
1844666 it does seem odd if the alterations only seem to go one way
1844667 this change also affected the entire record because there are missing days here and there
1844668 am i correct that when you changed the program to account for the missing 20 days in july there was a backward propagation of adjustments filling in for other missing days
1844669 you are good when i was at it i made another adjustment to the program i used to fit 4 harmonics sine cosine with frequencies 1 year through 4 year to describe the average seasonal cycle i changed that to 6 harmonics therefore there will be small systematic differences as a function of time of year in the de seasonalized trend that will be on top of adjustments caused by months in the past during which there were a number of missing days not symmetrically distributed during that month
1844670 the reason was simply that we had a problem with the equipment for the first half of july with the result that the earlier monthly average consisted of only the last 10 days since co2 always goes down fast during july the monthly average came out low i have now changed the program to take this effect into account and adjusting back to the middle of the month using the multi year average seasonal cycle this change also affected the entire record because there are missing days here and there
1844671 i think we are too conditioned to data getting hansenized and may be jumping to conclusions so far unlike hansen dr tans has been forthright with communicating his approach
1844672 if dr tans changed the harmonics that were used to compute the missing days and groom the data it could very well lead to the adjustment pattern we are seeing on the plot here without a complete description of his methodology before and after it is hard to really be certain
1844673 this measurement program is a bit informal but that happens sometimes

1844675 have desert researchers discovered a hidden loop in the carbon cycle
1844676 what is the fixed standard in co2 measurement what is the material of the co2 sensor how often is the co2 sensor calibrated against the standard what is the drift coefficient of the co2 sensor what is the linearity of the co2 sensor with electronics what is the drift of the linearity of the co2 sensor with electronics is this calibrated as well how old is the electronics used to measurement the co2 sensor how often is the electronics calibrated against known electronic standards how much random noise is in their measurement how specific is the sensor to only co2 does the sensor react with any other gas is the sensor calibrated over temperature is the data adjusted for temperature what is the sensor accuracy vs temperature how long does the sensor temperature soak before measurement is the sensor calibrated over atmospheric pressure what is the sensor accuracy vs atmospheric pressure
1844677 dr pieter tans of noaa caught altering manua loa co2 data by agw skeptics
1844678 the reason was simply that we had a problem with the equipment for the
1844679 that the positive trend of co2 is human made is quite clear
1844680 ok so mann cut a few corners but his results were essentially correct
1844681 suppose the equipment failed on july 20th and the failure caused the loss of the monthly data to date the issue becomes one of sloppy data safeguarding
1844682 so if the data from the last 30 years has now been changed how does that affect the climate models
1844683 it is not a big change did not change the slope
1844684 dr tans data is being used to support a massive attempt to regulate our lives and potentially cost us all a huge drop in our standard of living so his data manipulation with no peer review within 24 hours no documentation no impact study etc tells me they are not a serious science organization
1844685 the mass balance more co2 is emitted by humans than is accumulating in the atmosphere that means that natural sinks over a year are larger than natural sources

1844768 we want a reconditioned and more powerful public opinion in a universal organization and clarification of knowledge and ideas in a closer synthesis of university and educational activities in the evocation that is of what i have here called a world brain operating by an enhanced educational system through the whole body of mankind a world brain which will replace our multitude of unco ordinated ganglia our powerless miscellany of universities research institutions literatures with a purpose national education systems and the like
1844769 we do not want dictators we do not want oligarchic parties or class rule we want a widespread world intelligence conscious of itself
1844770 a distinguished specialist is precious because of his cultivated gift it does not follow at all that by the standards of all round necessity he is a superior person indeed by the very fact of his specialization he may be less practised and competent than the average man
1844771 i think we should get the very gist of this problem if we could compare twelve miscellaneous men of science and special skill with twelve unspecialized men taken let us say from the head clerks morning train to the city we should probably find that for commonplace team work and the ordinary demands and sudden urgencies of life the second dozen was individually quite as good as if not better than the first dozen in a burning hotel or cast away on a desert island they would probably do quite as well and yet collectively they would be ill informed and limited men the whole dozen of them would have nothing much more to tell you than any one of them
1844772 on the other hand our dozen specialists would each have something distinctive to tell you the more you got them together the more they would signify
1844773 i want to suggest that something a new social organ a new institution which for a time i shall call world encyclopaedia is the means whereby we can solve the problem of that jig saw puzzle and bring all the scattered and ineffective mental wealth of our world into something like a common understanding
1844774 i will take it first from the point of view of the ordinary educated citizen from his point of view the world encyclopaedia would be a row of volumes in his own home or in some neighbouring house or in a convenient public library or in any school or college and in this row of volumes he would without any great toil or difficulty find in clear understandable language and kept up to date the ruling concepts of our social order the outlines and main particulars in all fields of knowledge an exact and reasonably detailed picture of our universe a general history of the world and if by any chance he wanted to pursue a question into its ultimate detail a trustworthy and complete system of reference to primary sources of knowledge in fields where wide varieties of method and opinion existed he would find not casual summaries of opinions but very carefully chosen and correlated statements and arguments
1844775 the modern world encyclopaedia should consist of selections extracts quotations very carefully assembled with the approval of outstanding authorities in each subject carefully collated and edited and critically presented it would not be a miscellany but a concentration a clarification and a synthesis
1844776 every fresh mind should be brought into contact with its standing editorial organization and on the other hand its content would be the standard source of material for the instructional side of school and college work for the verification of facts and the testing of statements everywhere in the world
1844777 it would do just what our scattered and disoriented intellectual organizations of today fall short of doing it would hold the world together mentally
1844778 how often do we see men misrepresenting each other in order to exaggerate a difference and secure the gratification of an argumentative victory a world encyclopaedia as i conceive it would bring together into close juxtaposition and under critical scrutiny many apparently conflicting systems of statement it might act not merely as an assembly of fact and statement but as an organ of adjustment and adjudication a clearing house of misunderstandings it would be deliberately a synthesis and so act as a flux and a filter for a very great quantity of human misapprehension it would compel men to come to terms with one another
1844779 and next let us take this world encyclopaedia from the point of view of the specialist and the super intellectual on the assumptions that the world encyclopaedia is based on a world wide organization he will be a corresponding associate of the encyclopaedia organization he will be able to criticize the presentation of his subject to suggest amendments and re statements for a world encyclopaedia that was kept alive and up to date by the frequent re issue of its volumes could be made the basis of much fundamental discussion and controversy
1844780 how can it be set going how can it be organized and paid for
1844781 we want shall i call it an encyclopaedia society to ask for an encyclopaedia and get as many people as possible asking for an encyclopaedia directly that society asks for an encyclopaedia it will probably have to resort to precautionary measures against any enterprising publisher who may see in that demand a chance for selling some sort of vamped up miscellany as the thing required
1844782 i must repeat that for the purposes of a world encyclopaedia probably we would not want much original writing if a thing has been stated clearly and compactly once for all why paraphrase it or ask some inferior hand to restate it our job may be rather to secure the use of copyrights and induce leading exponents of this or that field of science or criticism to co operate in the selection condensation expansion or simplification of what they have already said so well
1844783 t his world encyclopaedia as i conceive it if only because it will have roped in the larger part of the original sources of exposition discussion and information will be in effect a world monopoly and it will be able to levy and distribute direct and indirect revenue on a scale quite beyond the resources of any private publishing enterprise
1844784 o f course from the very start various opinionated cults and propagandists will be doing their best to capture or buy the movement well we mustnt be captured or bought and in particular our silence must not be bought or captured
1844785 and there will be a constant danger that some of the early promoters may feel and attempt to realize a sort of proprietorship in the organization to make a group or a gang of it but to recognize that danger is half way to averting it
1844786 i think that the main text should be in one single language from which translations in whole or part could be made i do not think i am giving way to any patriotic bias when i suggest that unless we contemplate a polyglot publication english because it has a wider range than german a greater abundance and greater subtlety of expression than french and more precision than russian is the language in which the original text of a world encyclopaedia ought to stand
1844787 you see how such an encyclopaedia organization could spread like a nervous network a system of mental control about the globe knitting all the intellectual workers of the world through a common interest and a common medium of expression into a more and more conscious co operating unity and a growing sense of their own dignity informing without pressure or propaganda directing without tyranny
1844788 i believe that in some such way as i have sketched the mental forces now largely and regrettably scattered and immobilized in the universities the learned societies research institutions and technical workers of the world could be drawn together in a real directive world intelligence and by that mere linking and implementing of what is known human life as a whole could be made much surer stronger bolder and happier than it has ever been up to the present time
1844789 i am not saying that a world encyclopaedia in itself solve any single one of the vast problems that must be solved if man is to escape from his present dangers and distresses and enter upon a more hopeful phase of history what i am saying and saying with the utmost conviction is this that without a world encyclopaedia to hold mens minds together in something like a common interpretation of reality there is no hope whatever of anything but an accidental and transitory alleviation of any of our world troubles

1844847 i wish i could control the thoughts in my mind
1844848 its hard enough sometimes controlling my behavior when im being eaten alive inside i always try to put on a good front here at work and at home
1844849 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs
1844850 he said well they told my family that i was a murderer
1844851 what he said was my therapist is revealing all my private conversations to the fbi
1844852 somewhat prone to hyperbole when you talked with him youd have to sift through what he was saying to get to the truth of it
1844853 one glass of wine and it would make him really goofy

1844863 the european market has been growing year by year and its certainly been a hope of ours that it would become a viable alternative for players

1844872 for europe to truly get to the point where they can compete with the nba for all kinds of players theyre going to have to implement a system where theres a lot more comfort that the contracts are truly guaranteed once that happens then i think youll truly see great competition for players
1844873 we could have came to an agreement last year so i think thats the window of opportunity for a lot of teams

1844989 door de onafhankelijkheid van kosovo is er nu een periode van reflectie in servi om het eens mild te zeggen ik begrijp de servische zorgen al zijn die natuurlijk nooit een rechtvaardiging voor aanvallen op ambassades europa wil servi graag het europese perspectief bieden maar it takes two to tango servi moet zijn betrokkenheid bij europa gaan uiten
1844990 we moeten geduld hebben met servi het lijkt me nu niet nuttig om een tijdslimiet te stellen ik begrijp de gevoelens aan de andere kant zullen de servi rs ook moeten begrijpen dat ze niet onschuldig zijn aan de situatie die heeft geleid tot de onafhankelijkheid van kosovo door wat er is gebeurd in naam van het servische volk
1844991 ik zit lang genoeg in de politiek om te weten dat je de dingen voortdurend moet herhalen dat helpt om mensen in servi te laten beseffen waar het om gaat
1844992 er is een uitdrukking huil niet om gemorste melk aan de voorwaarde van volledige samenwerking met het tribunaal had nog wel voldaan moeten worden voordat het verdrag geratificeerd had kunnen worden maar het deel over handel met de eu zou van kracht zijn geweest ik denk dat het akkoord een solide basis had kunnen zijn servi had op het europese spoor kunnen zitten
1844993 vorig voorjaar werden zdravko tolimir bosnisch servische generaal red en vlastimir djordjevic servische oud generaal red uitgeleverd er werd beter samengewerkt tussen de civiele en de militaire inlichtingendiensten in servi het tribunaal werd betrokken bij het wekelijkse overleg over verdachten en aan het eind van de zomer werd er ook nog een beloning van een miljoen euro uitgeloofd voor essenti le informatie over mladic naar mijn idee deed servi bijna alles wat het kon doen
1844994 in januari zei ik servi is nu dichtbij die volledige samenwerking en in het licht van de politieke situatie was het belangrijk om servi op de europese rails te krijgen als de nationalistische krachten de overhand hadden gekregen zou mladic zeker niet naar den haag komen

1845085 just having a real company directory where you can see who everyone is what they do and what they look like would be a huge step forward for us

1845090 end the brutality to those who are forced to go through forced abortions and have no voice we are your voice
1845091 today we stand as a bold and prophetic witness against the tyranny and brutality by the chinese government against their own people
1845092 china also promotes the barbaric practice of forced abortion and sterilization while those who speak out against human rights abuses by the chinese government are crushed and trampled and the peaceful citizens of tibet have been brutalized by chinese leaders
1845093 today we follow the teachings of jesus in matthew 25 and stand in solidarity with our oppressed chinese brothers and sisters our public witness is a visible reminder that 100 000 military troops and abusive security measures cannot silence the voice of freedom justice and the power of the gospel of christ the truth will always be heard and we hope that president bush will boldly speak out against these human rights abuses on his official visit to china during the olympics
1845094 because of slot cheating and other crimes has been arrested and charged with nine counts of breaking a state law that bars anyone in the book from entering nevada casinos
1845095 being the observant person that i am i watch them anyway
1845096 the government thinks i could be apart of the first line of defense
1845097 it is important that people who work in the industry when they see something suspicious they feel comfortable calling
1845098 maybe that one incident doesnt bring actionable intelligence but that combined with other intel can piece together the puzzle
1845099 i really believe that gamers are the next rock stars
1845100 but back in the 1800s the coal miners and railroad workers probably thought that hitting a baseball for a living was the most absurd thing theyd ever heard of no ones ever going to get paid to hit a little ball and run around a field thats ridiculous thats pretty much what were doing
1845101 i was won over by these people their sincerity and the fact that these games are reflective of a variety of skills
1845102 its compelling not to overgush because theres still something enjoyably ridiculous about the whole scene too the deeper i got into it the more ridiculous it seemed and the more won over by it i was at the same time
1845103 were talking about a nine inning game and a quarters like an inning
1845104 although we understand that nice often has to make difficult decisions in this case there is a clear separation between what nice finds to be valuable treatment and clinical and patient opinion action is needed to bring these two positions closer together
1845105 the decisions nice has to make are some of the hardest in public life nhs resources are not limitless and nice has to decide what treatments represent best value to the patient as well as the nhs
1845106 although these treatments are clinically effective regrettably the cost to the nhs is such that they are not a cost effective use of nhs resources they have the potential to extend progression free survival by five to six months but at a cost of 20 000 to 35 000 per patient per year
1845107 if these treatments were provided on the nhs other patients would lose out on treatments that are both clinically and cost effective
1845108 the possibility that we may be prevented from offering sutent to our patients is an outrage and a devastating blow to the kidney cancer community this will mean that the uk will have the poorest survival figures for metastatic renal cell cancer in europe
1845109 sutent produces a remarkable effect on survival for patients it is now no longer ethical or reasonable for patients to have access to treatment only with interferon
1845110 it makes you feel kind of hated and not wanted here pretty much i dont get why people are like that sometimes because you know like we get along with everybody that comes around here too
1845111 like we dont make any hate remarks or anything like that but i dont get why they do something like that
1845112 it exudes an aura of peace and beauty and a loving gesture
1845113 you think of rock as being something hard but the effect is actually totally soft and embracing
1845114 and as i look at what happened here that is exactly what martin luther king was standing up against
1845115 there will be a limited and very carefully done opportunity for people to carefully view and not shield their eyes from what happened but they also will have an opportunity to personally participate in the first phase of cleaning
1845116 were going to have to come out here twice a week until the snow flies
1845117 artilects artificial intellects which 21 century technologies will make possible that will have mental capacities trillions of trillions of times above the human level
1845118 should humanity place an upper limit on robot and artificial brain intelligence
1845119 if not then what are the consequences for human survival if we become the number 2 species
1845120 destiny of the human species to serve as the stepping stone to the creation of a higher form of being
1845121 do you feel personally that humanity should build artilects these godlike massively intelligent machines despite the risk that they might decide in a highly advanced form to wipe out humanity yes or no
1845122 im glad im alive now at least i will die peacefully in my bed however i truly fear for my grandchildren they will be caught up in the artilect war and will probably be destroyed by it

1845130 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
1845131 one hopes that this case is going to bring more attention to the issue of the disappeared
1845132 with the us finally admitting custody of dr aafia siddiqui one of the most brutal cases of the suppression of individual freedom has begun to unravel
1845133 while the pakistani government has belatedly begun to admit that it had some responsibility towards dr aafia it has a lot of explaining to do as to who had been detaining her and where she has been since she was picked up from karachi in 2003 along with her three children
1845134 the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of the truth an us charges rebutted with strong evidence of cia meddling in pakistan perfidious double standards to malign pakistan and justify attacking it taliban tenacity and ferocity impedes worlds most powerful army the aftermath of the kabul embassy bombs profound changes in indian policy reviving hindusism in budhdist lands the hindu extremists use the safron swastika flag instead of the tri colored flag of india

1845144 i was a child and he took away that child someone else came out alive and a fighter
1845145 im just really happy that hes staying where he is that everyone once again is safe
1845146 im not just a statistic i have a name i have a face
1845147 by adding a gene weve essentially been able to take embryonic stem cells which make everything and push them a little bit down one particular pathway the endoderm pathway
1845148 and thats the pathway of the cells that give rise to all the tissues of the gut to the lungs to the liver to the pancreas to very important cells that one day could be used for regenerative medicine
1845149 these cells themselves would not be used for transplantation but theyre a tool to help us understand that process
1845150 so we created a new kind of stem cell limited to making only one cell type
1845151 its just really about controlling stem cells is really what it comes down to
1845152 were one step closer to being able to use these cells if were one step closer to being able to control what they can become
1845153 how do you get a cell that can become over 200 different things to become one thing and not the other 199
1845154 i think what theyve done is establish a proof of principle that stem cells can be directed in a very refined way
1845155 they were on a street in south peterborough when they came in contact with this red van
1845156 were not sure what happened at that point whether she willingly went into the van or was coerced or grabbed
1845157 i didnt take any notice because you hear stuff all the time ive called police before and they dont come because theres parties in there all the time now i wish i had called
1845158 at this time of course we werent aware of what this call was
1845159 we later connected the dots up to the fact that there was a young girl missing from peterborough
1845160 after the van left we found this female in the vicinity of courtice high school and certainly she appeared to have been sexually assaulted
1845161 investigators are with her now obviously trying to get as much information as possible
1845162 the rough has neutralized everybody theres no shot making out of that rough ive never seen greens like this its tough
1845163 i think this week is very similar to a u s open although the greens wont be as firm hopefully
1845164 but the rough is up so if youre going to be hitting it into the rough at a pretty constant pace youre not going to be shooting a good number you want to hit at least 60 to 65 percent of your fairways
1845165 youre going to be scrambling because youre not going to hit all of these greens and youre going to miss them in some awkward places youre going to have to hole out from eight to 10 feet because even if you hit greens in regulation you get them on the wrong side

1845168 were told a man in the white t shirt and dark colored hat followed another man out of the caseys bar on east main street and they crossed the road after some sort of confrontation the suspect walks back near caseys bar he speaks with two other men he paces the sidewalk for a while then he crosses the street a second time thats when the violent assault took place camera owner i saw pushing and shoving and fists flying and what looked like kicking the 47 year old victim suffered multiple fractures to his face sources say the suspect yelled anti gay slurs at the victim and police say thats why theyre treating it as a hate crime
1845169 it was a bit cowardly we would have thought he would have at least have had the courage to come and see the court
1845170 van hook 48 was convicted of murdering a man he met in a gay bar he never denied strangling and repeatedly stabbing david self in selfs apartment in cincinnati in 1985 but claimed temporary insanity we think it is the correct decision under the circumstances and we think there is even more evidence than they discussed that will support their decision keith yeazel the columbus attorney who has represented van hook in his federal appeals said of mondays ruling
1845171 national stonewall democrats announced that a record number of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt delegates more than 350 will attend the democratic national convention in denver colorado this represents approximately 6 of total convention attendees and is 27 increase from the 282 lgbt participants in 2004

1845202 and this girl the one on camera was drunk and fucked up and smoking cigarettes and looking right into the camera and saying go ahead videotape me i dont care
1845203 but the fact that she drank alcohol made all the difference in the world everybody drank that night i didnt ask to go to that party my rotten girlfriend took me to that party
1845204 ill tell you one thing i looked sexier than the girl who got fucked i had longer hair thicker hair and all that i dont know what to say its called in concert i didnt hire the girl and say okay bitch take your pants down and the dildos going in your mouth pussy and ass
1845205 and you know what the burbank police dept said because this is on record no sex crime questionable consent the girl takes off her clothes with her own hands this is according to the videotape shes going along with this and theres seven seconds of distress with a sex toy and not a penis im sure youve seen worse than that on a porn set
1845206 then shes on the videotape saying go ahead videotape me i dont care
1845207 fuck her you might be wondering why she said that because her friend who ratted the incident out to the cops was upset her fully clothed friend was upset about this lady is smoking cigarettes drinking a beer out of a miller beer bottles and getting dildos in her body
1845208 because i had tattoos and hair down to my butt
1845209 i was prettier than any girl in the house i was so pretty

1845215 when the sex started the girl was naked on the bed with many people in attendance male and female while i was still in west hollywood at the rainbow how long do you have to beat me up and punish me for watching that and only for a few minutes
1845216 there was a reason why the burbank police dept said no crime committed no charges filed i was a fucking teenager thats why it led to the criminal court building its called shopping for a prosecution it happened at the cabrini town homes on glen oaks blvd down from the old defunct ksex building i was a guest i was downstairs with my girlfriend
1845217 it doesnt matter what reporters say about us as long as they spell our name right
1845218 if you think about the midwest think about right here what weve got is all kind of towns that we could connect
1845219 all of these cities are they basically take in the air about 45 minutes to an hour to fly
1845220 where there is a need to know and a right to know the information in the performance of a law enforcement activity
1845221 when the information falls within the law enforcement counterterrorism or national security responsibility of the receiving agency or may assist in preventing crime or the use of violence or any conduct dangerous to human life or property

1845257 i know one of the questions that inevitably will come is when will the decision be made who will be picked
1845258 and i just want to address that right off the top i dont have any particular insights as to where brett favre is going to play
1845259 in a place like minnesota you can go out and get all the registered and reliable republicans and in a statewide election in an average year youll get about 35 percent
1845260 if you define progress simply as what is government not doing that it can do or what is government currently doing that it can do more of republicans will never prevail
1845261 inevitably in campaigns theres going to be some back and forth some contrast
1845262 the fcc does not regulate the internet or internet service providers isp
1845263 it just showed us the location we have to look for the lake thats so frozen the ice isnt considered thin
1845264 i dont know why but i felt like i had to follow you guys
1845265 according to andrews artifacts the shark is found underwater and under the ice since its been frozen its probably sleeping and undisturbed now lets move
1845266 but how do we get it out of the ice
1845267 my leader wants those artifacts so he could activate the nothingness mechs
1845268 and if you want to proceed youll have to fight me
1845269 although it was made from another deck the archfiends suit my style
1845270 ive faced off against archfiends before and im guessing that the decks from titan before he went into the shadow realm
1845271 fine but i win i get the artifacts and if you win ill leave you alone and let you proceed
1845272 and you tell us what your leader is after the avatar mechs for
1845273 dont expect the seal of orichalcos in this duel weve no need for artifacts that backfire
1845274 and the extra slot would be perfect for my heroes
1845275 actually my master informed me of your style so expect a trap card which makes your fusions useless now lets play the game
1845276 after that i then summon the pandemonium field spell which turns this lifeless arctic into a chessboard for my archfiends
1845277 i then play one card face down and end my turn your move yuki
1845278 and even if i did id use it against criminals not heroes
1845279 just checking because i play graceful charity this spell card lets me draw three cards by discarding two
1845280 but you cant just summon a level seven monster onto the field
1845281 actually one of the cards i discarded was necroshade due to graceful charity and i had activated his special effect
1845282 should have seen that coming now are you going to attack
1845283 and fall into a trap no way i throw down a couple face downs and end my turn
1845284 it wasnt a trap it was a continuous spell card known as banner of courage
1845285 and every turn that its being used all monsters on my side of the field gain 200 attack and defense points
1845286 however the archfiends may have been titans for awhile but one of them suits me now i play vilepawn archfiend in order to summon the king terrorking archfiend
1845287 and because of my banners effect they gain 200 attack and defense points
1845288 thats right yuki plus theres more to the terrorking than its special effect
1845289 the terrorking reminds me of myself when i had the death note in my possession
1845290 kira the first actually the second third and fourth kiras were just pawns in my plan to dominate the world but i was discovered by that l wannabe near and i died fading into the realm of nothingness that was until my master came for me
1845291 im not at liability to say yuki would shock your friend now since your monster is stronger than mine ill lay another face down and end my turn
1845292 get ready to face defeat yagami i play my first face down soul exchange in order to grab your vilepawn and watchbear
1845293 what good will they do for you youll have to pay 500 life points in order to get vilepawn to work
1845294 how is that even possible theres no records of a dark magician in your deck
1845295 there wasnt one in my elemental heroes deck which was the deck i used in duel academy my first deck was actually a mix of yugis and joeys when yubel was with me as a kid i just rediscovered that deck and implemented my hero cards with it now through the effects of dark renewal i sacrifice the vilepawn archfiend and pandemonium watchbear to summon the dark magician
1845296 i didnt believe it at first either but when pegasus created duel monsters he used ancient history as a reference which is why we have the dark magician who was one of the pharaohs high priests at first with us today
1845297 youre telling me that the dark magician was once human
1845298 however since i used soul exchange i cant attack with him but i can use bladedge to attack your terrorking
1845299 oh and before i forget bladedges special ability makes you lose life points to the number of attack points bladedge has
1845300 nutrient z with this trap im able to restore 4000 life points after i get attacked
1845301 nice try but youre going to have to do better than that
1845302 ill throw down a couple face downs and end my turn
1845303 because of that little encounter ill sacrifice my desrook archfiend to revive my terrorking
1845304 its different this time because the terrorking isnt the only one whos my favorite i play cost down
1845305 with this card i can summon a level five or six monster like it was a level three or four and the card i summon is jinzo
1845306 as a duelist i have to expect traps so i got this from the local card store and jinzos special ability reflects that of my paranoid nature if theres a trap jinzo will destroy it
1845307 i play the flute of summoning kuriboh this spell card lets me summon my winged kuriboh from the deck and makes it the target for your jinzos attack
1845308 nope because my partners special effect prevents that from happening
1845309 i play pot of greed which lets me draw two cards
1845310 although amplifier enhances your jinzo it also has a setback if its destroyed so is your jinzo
1845311 when he appears i can special summon the other two hero kids from my deck two more kids in helmets appeared
1845312 theyre here for the arrival of my own favorite monster let me introduce you to the intergalactic hero elemental hero neos
1845313 easy neos and dark magician are going to use contact fusion
1845314 ladies and gentlemen say hello to the newest fusion elemental hero astral mage neos
1845315 this card was made from your friendship with the pharaoh right
1845316 you guessed right and due to skyscrapers effect astral mage neos gets an attack boost
1845317 and since your astral mages special ability doesnt target anyone terrorking archfiend is useless
1845318 light had you not touched the death note you wouldnt be in this situation
1845319 soon enough astral mage neos destroyed terrorking archfiend turning lights life points into zero
1845320 our leader isnt interested in recreating it you can find your answers when you leave your third world andrew

1845325 a man who turned novel writing into a force for freedom
1845326 the books by solzhenitsyn excruciated stalinism as a dominant ideology in the former
1845327 in my life his novel but a turnover in the thoughts and opinions occurred not only in my head but also in the whole intellectual world writers workers of science the arts and representatives of intelligentsia started looking at the surrounding world without rose colored spectacles
1845328 alexander solzhenitsyns contribution to the political public and cultural life of this country is immeasurable his name spelled in gold letters has gone down in russian and world history and the history of the human rights movement
1845329 his image as the conscience of communist ruled dimmed after his repatriation and his diatribes on the denigration of his nation that were at times tainted with paranoia anti semitism and bigotry
1845330 rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him
1845331 mans sense of responsibility to god and society grew dimmer and dimmer
1845332 solzhenitsyn called for a moral and spiritual reawakening in his homeland and the west based on fundamental christian values and a rejection of the materialism hedonism and selfishness that he insisted was corrupting civilization
1845333 it sends out a clear message to nrl players and juniors that its okay to assault a referee as in grabbing hold of the jumper and pulling it as gallen did
1845334 it sends out a message that it is okay to verbally run at a referee using foul language as crocker did in the warriors game
1845335 but it is not okay in a very sedate fashion to ask a referee why a penalty has been given and then to accept the decision but finally to make a gesture of frustration not at the referee but the fact the penalty would piggy back the opposition up the field
1845336 im very disappointed with the outcome im thankful i got a good hearing
1845337 im just going to serve my time and ill look forward to coming back in two weeks and playing good footy

1845435 however he characterised the african church as made up of prosperity preaching and a dualistic gospel of evacuation to heaven after death bishop sebastian bakare of harare noted that the african church is far too diverse to be characterised in this way it is to be doubted whether missiologists such as lamin sanneh and andrew walls or historians such as philip jenkins and terry ranger would agree with brian maclarens too broad brush approach

1845447 if ken silva wishes to place another article up titled
1845448 i challenge anyone to find any criticisms observations corrections in that ken silva article that discusses my theology or doctrinal beliefs such material is not there that article was personal in all its attacks it was nothing more than an article deliberately designed to impugn my personal professional integrity
1845449 i took your challenge of finding anything resembling an argument of your doctrinal and theological positions in that article and could not find anything substantive and the more time i took in reading it and looking for evidence the more i found myself agreeing with you that the article bordered on being slanderous
1845450 the email i sent to ipower was a basic template that covers all manner of complaints that can be sent to an isp e g illegal pornography unlicensed photograph use libel anything that is covered in a tos agreement i am not going to go around re writing templates when i can simply throw it up to use
1845451 i received an email from ipower wherein they stated that they do not simply remove a website when a third party complains
1845452 feel the need to respond to everyone who has a point of view that differs from mine in every web forum i find

1845456 if any of you has a dispute with another dare he take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the saints therefore if you have disputes about such matters appoint as judges even men of little account in the church i say this to shame you is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers but instead one brother goes to law against another and this in front of unbelievers
1845457 how about less time defending richard abanes and more time studying the word of god

1845467 we are pleased that in the face of a challenging economy and elevated activity levels throughout our organization as new it initiatives are rolled out and acquisitions are absorbed the company has turned in a solid performance for the first half of the year earnings per share increased by 32 for the quarter and 30 for the year to date the katrina settlement was partially offset by changes in prior year insurance reserve estimates and an increase in post retirement benefit costs excluding these items earnings per share increased 15 for the quarter and 26 for the first half of the year this performance reinforces the belief that our management contract based business model is well suited to minimize the impact of such economic conditions i am pleased that the second quarter retention metrics remained strong with location retention at 91 and gross profit retention at 97 which suggest that our clients continue to recognize the excellent service that our employees consistently strive to deliver
1845468 that said in the second quarter many of the parking facilities we operate did experience a decline in parking volume that correlates with general reports of a decline in travel and driving activity levels accordingly were not surprised to see a moderation in our gross profit growth as economic conditions impact some of our locations we are proactively reviewing the staffing levels and operating expense structures at all of our locations to ensure that they are appropriate in light of these changing operating conditions
1845469 during these times we are especially focused on the basic elements of our business that will drive continued improvement in the companys financial performance these include growing the number of locations as well as increasing gross profit per location by taking advantage of our management contracts fee escalation provisions and selling additional services we also continue to move forward with it initiatives intended to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs finally we continue to deploy the companys substantial free cash flow to pursue acquisitions and share buybacks
1845470 we are very proud of having renegotiated our bank credit agreement to have completed this transaction in this uncertain economic environment in which financial institutions are generally looking to decrease their exposures is a real testament to the confidence that our lenders have placed in the company

1845492 wir erwarten in rund zwei wochen das schriftliche urteil dann berlegen wir ob sich der gang in eine h here instanz lohnt
1845493 ich mache t glich fitness und reha training alles l uft positiv es ist realistisch dass ich mitte september wieder auf dem spielfeld bin
1845494 die fifa hat durch bewusste verschleppungstaktik die klubs und die spieler in diese klemme gebracht
1845495 dann werden wir den spieler sperren und die fifa darauf hinweisen dass er unberechtigt am turnier teilnimmt
1845496 rafinha f nf minuten vor dem ersten spiel zur ckzuholen bringt nichts er w re total frustriert w rde uns nicht helfen
1845497 es gef llt mir gut ich bleibe hier ich will bei olympia spielen
1845498 real ist ein wahnsinn ich war schon baff als ich zu meinen ersten training aufs gel nde kam eine ganz neue dimension wie gro das alles ist ich habe hier allein acht trainingspl tze gez hlt
1845499 mit einigen habe ich schon zusammengespielt einigen anderen im spiel gegen ber gestanden und den rest kannte ich nur aus dem fernsehen
1845500 nur neues zurzeit f r mich in kolumbien war ich auch noch nie
1845501 ich konnte mich nicht entscheiden ob ich einen doppelsalto oder tsukahara doppelsalto gehockt d red bringen soll und schon lag ich da
1845502 nadine stand perfekt marta hat wohl ein nadine angerer syndrom
1845503 meine vision ist dass hoffenheim bald auf eigenen f en steht ich f hle mich in diesem fall als investor nicht als sponsor meinen s hnen m chte ich nichts hinterlassen was defizite produziert
1845504 es fehlt noch ein bi chen was bei mir ich brauche noch eine woche
1845505 nat rlich will ich gerne spielen aber ich bin nicht entt uscht wenn ich in halle auf der bank sitze ich bin im moment ein bi chen m de
1845506 das war schon eine etwas andere vorbereitung als sonst die ganzen reisen st ndig unterwegs sein aber wir haben gut gearbeitet das trainings programm hat mich gut aufgebaut
1845507 es kommt so langsam n chste woche lege ich richtig los
1845508 ich wei genau was ich kann ich werde meine tore machen
1845509 ich mache keinen rger ich denke immer positiv das ist das geheimnis wenn ich nicht spiele gebe ich im training noch mehr gas jeder wird seine chance bekommen
1845510 ich f hle mich geehrt dass mir diese wichtige aufgabe bertragen worden ist wie meine vier kollegen werde ich verantwortungsbewusst damit umgehen
1845511 flo ist viel l nger beim bvb ist doch klar dass ich ihm sofort die binde abgetreten habe
1845512 f r uns ist es wichtig dass wir einen kader haben bei dem wir zwei drei verletzungen wegstecken k nnen wir gucken dass wir ein zwei leute kriegen mit denen wir in den kader stabilit t reinbekommen
1845513 van der vaart war eminent wichtig er hat in vielen spielen den unterschied gemacht wir m ssen eine mannschafts konstellation finden die uns erfolgreich spielen l sst es geht um die mannschafts st rke das hei t nicht dass wir einen star holen
1845514 ich erwarte mir als positiven effekt von rafaels wechsel dass andere spieler ein st ck mehr verantwortung bernehmen
1845515 die situation ist so dass es schwierig ist spieler zu holen die als ebenb rtig oder besser als unsere angesehen werden
1845516 ich mache keine rangliste im tor klar ist dass nikolov im ersten spiel im tor steht
1845517 aber wie es weitergeht h ngt vom genesungsprozess ab schlie lich war er lange verletzt
1845518 bis dahin h tte er h chstens dreimal mit der mannschaft trainiert das w re viel zu wenig und den anderen gegen ber nicht gerecht
1845519 er hat sechs wochen lang knochenhart gearbeitet und in den tests gut gehalten
1845520 ich mache mir keinen kopf mehr wann was ist wichtig ist nur dass ich fit werde

1845523 die gibt es tats chlich aber sie sind bei weitem noch nicht ausreichend nach unseren ma st ben ist das unzureichend aber wenn wir die spiele nur in l nder vergeben wo die menschenrechte verwirklicht werden gehen uns relativ schnell die kandidaten aus wie geht man dann mit einem land um das beispielsweise guantanamo us internierungslager auf kuba die red und abu ghuraib von den usa kontrolliertes gef ngnis im irak die red zu verantworten hat und wo gefangene gefoltert werden d rfen
1845524 nein die zusicherungen die gegeben wurden werden jetzt eingehalten dass am anfang internet seiten gesperrt waren hat uns berrascht wir haben entsprechend reagiert

1845538 what ive done cannot be justified amp that is that is an immutable fact but at the same time if it is possible for us to learn and if we can make some amends from this if others can learn from my mistakes and not make the same mistake then some good has come out of my experience amp im not going to stay in the gutter and just you know squalor self pity woe is me ive done enough of that

1845542 he said he had tried to write me but he did not know where to begin he was very light spoken and there were a lot of pauses he said he was sorry for what he had done and he said the lee malvo then and the lee malvo now are two different people
1845543 see its like abused women people say they cant understand why they cant leave the relationship its because she becomes completely dependent on this fool when i was rebuked i blamed myself completely for it i became completely completely completely dependent on him completely there was no lee left amp i just gave it up it wasnt hard i already hated myself he just knew what to say to channel all that anger
1845544 i want to believe that he is truly sorry she said
1845545 i want to know that he is going to think about this every day amp but i want to find closure in my own heart
1845546 i actually dont feel any better i actually feel worse

1845609 if your father is a model for god then what is really meant by this does it necessarily mean your father or is it a confusing play on words because like god father can be used in its place is this book trying to portray using the word father instead of god just so the thought of god does not make you feel as meek or empty but your father as a role model for god is not usually the case anyway in typical families i feel the mother is supposed to be the role model more so but this book does not favor the females of course
1845610 i agree with you and the way you say that the face is most logically becoming from a catcall on the street which brings femininity back into being an object but is there ever a way to keep one general thing as males or females as a commonly known object or subject no of course not which is where i get lost when they are in transition between being an object and subject but i do agree with you on the pictures and the male gaze thingy

1845620 cqu is in the process of evaluating the current working environment and wonder that its current operational system should support this change and enhance their strategy plan
1845621 you think im an arrogant expletive wh gt photographer isaac layman on in visible

1845623 this study conclude that cqu as a higher educational institution should in order to achieve their strategic goals go for an adoption of the new release of their currently implemented peoplesoft system campus solution which in fact would integrate all their current systems as well as making use of the other systems the vender package provide

1845645 when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it

1845647 obama spokesman bill burton said the democrat voted for the bill because it included huge investments in renewable energy

1845700 consumer respondents were presented a brief description containing key features of rims new smart phone models along with a follow up question asking them how likely they were to buy each model if and when it becomes available the survey found the new rim releases each showing considerable potential among consumers once they actually get into the marketplace
1845701 these results show consumers hungry for all varieties of blackberry

1845706 the iphone only implements four of the up to 46 exchange security policies depending on the exchange version if an enterprise is using any of these extensions then it must reconcile the downgrade of these policies if deploying the iphone
1845707 in tests conducted by gartner contacts we have discovered that the product works via an unencrypted distributed xml file which could be changed by the end user apple indicates that the profiles can be signed warning the user of their legitimacy but the most trusted management tools dont empower the user to make these types of security decisions we would like to see this application become a formal product and expanded to support the management and security features found in rims blackberry enterprise server and in microsofts system center mobile device manager
1845708 apple has improved the overall e mail experience with a separate contact application and contact search and the iphone has always offered the most readable e mail we consider its method for combining a global address list and a contact search for names to be the best we have seen
1845709 apple has delivered an iphone that is acceptable for business use at the appliance level
1845710 those who previously used a blackberry windows mobile or nokia smartphone device should note that the iphone will require an assessment of trade offs in hardware design and onboard functionality however each enterprise will view iphone through its own lens which will be heavily tinted by the organizations security and management needs enterprises should approach expanded use of the iphone slowly and with close examination

1845741 basic right to seek review in the united states supreme court would be rendered meaningless
1845742 has decided to seek federal judicial review of a decision that has troubling near term and long term ramifications for the constitutional rights of maine citizens
1845743 the maine law court has construed and applied maine law in a manner that not only tramples upon the federal constitutional rights of mr hoffman but also on the rights of the thousands of maine voters who validly signed his petitions and the rights of other members of the electorate who seek to engage in political expression or association through the nomination of non party candidates to federal or state office

1845747 i rock up to training and folkesy steve folkes someone that to be honest has never paid any interest in my personal life he comes up to me and starts saying youre not turning muslim are you
1845748 i start to think who is he to question my friends
1845749 if you asked hazem el masri about how i perceive muslims youll find ive often asked him questions about the religion because i dont fully understand it
1845750 if something comes up that i heard i ask him
1845751 its certainly not right of him to say that we took no interest in his home life or personal life
1845752 i supported him through the clovelly hotel thing when he was caught allegedly having sex in the toilets with ironwoman candice falzon his drink driving thing through his urinating in public thing
1845753 we stood up for him and did our best to try and get him through that so i think it is a pretty naive statement to make
1845754 in light of what has happened my advice about him not putting too much credence into what anthony mundine says was probably good advice
1845755 who is he to come and question my friends and their values and their religion
1845756 who does he think he is does he think he is god is he god or something yeah whatever comes out of his mouth is that right
1845757 when i did join up with khoder and asked khoder to manage me

1845765 that has now come down to 81 9c which is a reduction of 15 4c
1845766 to cut to the chase on tuesday the average price for that same period had fallen by 15c to an average of 144 4c
1845767 for motorists it is very confusing and if they are still seeing prices up around 162c they are upset the prices arent coming down
1845768 it is extremely difficult and that is the benefit of fuelwatch
1845769 there was a 27c per litre range in sydney yesterday some petrol retailers may not pass on the reductions in wholesale prices as quickly as others
1845770 those particular retailers are outed using the fuelwatch system at the moment they keep prices higher until someone is cheaper
1845771 we will probably see prices down below 1 30 soon and over this coming week well see the national average price down to 1 25
1845772 it is starting to work its way down theres should be another 5c to 10c of savings coming for motorists to enjoy
1845773 we have a watchdog that has bark but no bite
1845774 we hope his replacement is going to be aggressive and pursue oil companies to look after motorists interests
1845775 i filled up on saturday in parramatta and it was 1 36 compared with anything ive seen around it was cheap as chips i travel everywhere and it is much cheaper to fill up further away from the city in campbelltown and places like that it is much cheaper
1845776 it is our belief that net 3 5 in general and silverlight in particular will change programming more significantly than anything that has come from microsoft for a least a decade
1845777 there were still negotiations continuing on some points within the contract including television rights television coverage and facilities
1845778 while these points could not be finalised the trip was still a valuable exercise
1845779 sign the new indy racing league sanction agreement between the gold coast motor events company and the indy racing league securing indy car racing for the gold coast through to 2013 inclusive
1845780 it seems the minister was able to support the lakers basketball team but not the bullets fly in an lapd helicopter while refusing to provide one for the queensland police and attend the indy 500 but let the gold coast indy collapse
1845781 clearly the purpose of minister spences trip was to negotiate an agreement finalise and sign it
1845782 when she arrived and held the negotiations there were further matters that needed to be resolved between the parties
1845783 strategies aimed at eliciting effective t cell responses to hiv by vaccination must broaden their scope beyond generation of antigen specific cd8 t cells to include optimization of the generation of cd4 t cells of the right quality and magnitude
1845784 the predicted similarity in binding specificity between chimpanzee and protective hla molecules clearly supports the hypothesis that the mhc class i repertoire of chimpanzees has been formed under selective pressure induced by an hiv like virus
1845785 our results indicate that the binding motifs of protective hla and chimpanzee molecules are directed towards peptides able to elicit effective cd8 t cell responses against hiv 1 and that similarity to chimpanzee mhc specificity plays a central role in controlling hiv 1 viral load in humans
1845786 the key breakthrough was the science that focused their attention laser like on that flask
1845787 dr ivins was adamant in his response that there had been no omission from his redacted submission and he insisted that he had provided rmr 1029 to the fbi in his second submission samples in april 2002
1845788 does not clearly recognize the right to life from conception without mentioning the word abortion the proposed constitution leaves the door open to the suppression of new life in the womb of the mother
1845789 acknowledges in every person the right to decide when and how many children to have this is understood even after they have procreated assuming in this way the acceptance of abortion
1845790 attacks the family as the fundamental unit of society and of the common good the new constitution diminishes the family when it rejects the existence of the model family to substitute it with different types of family from there it goes to equate same sex unions with the family
1845791 we have discovered that statism seems to be the connecting thread of the new constitution it speaks about rights of course but many of these rights flow from the state violating the creativity and responsibility of people within society
1845792 the statism is even more evident in the area of education
1845793 the right of parents and the recognition of freedom of instruction are contradicted when the state arrogates to itself the right to determine what must be taught and what must be ignored
1845794 its a lie and you have no right to do that you are engaging in political activity you are betraying your role as a pastor
1845795 nine women went in that morning and linda was able to talk to two or three of them
1845796 in stark contrast to the opponent gearing down the legal machinery the pro life presence at the trial was unapologetically bold and robust
1845797 in the body of the court as well as outside at the show the truth street demonstration their witness was both seen and felt
1845798 a court attendant reported to the court guards they are all over outside and waiting in front of the court doors she nervously warned me to not look talk or wave at any of them
1845799 it gave me immense satisfaction that the languid legal muscle being flexed in the court basement to weaken our public witness was at that moment being trumped by the show the truth dynamism above on college park and in the courtroom
1845800 kudos to those who waited on court and put shoe to pavement perhaps to be known as the college street regulars
1845801 i absolutely believe show the truth makes this happen its a radical human response to a radically inhuman practice henry morgentaler has stood against the blood of his neighbour and canada has honoured him for it
1845802 were certainly disappointed that kline lost his election bid and more than likely the criminal charges brought against planned parenthood will be dropped by steve howe and guinn
1845803 both of them are supported by planned parenthood and the big abortion money
1845804 there are some causes that are worth losing for and in that there is no defeat
1845805 although we are disappointed we are not deterred we have several other backup plans that we are working on right now
1845806 planned parenthood and other abortion providers are breaking the law flagrantly and we are going to be here until this battle ends and that will be noticed by the fact that no more children are dying
1845807 gods not done with him this is far from the last time we will hear from phill kline
1845808 i believe that the threats are part of an unfortunate way of doing politics in the country threats of various kinds i cant deny that they are always fearful
1845809 one isnt accustomed to this when one has a peaceful vision of the world but it is painful to confirm the aggressiveness of some people who anonymously dedicate themselves to intimidation
1845810 we will no longer permit agents of the extreme right like you to block our route
1845811 remember that accidental deaths happen daily in our country do not continue your anti woman and homophobic campaign death to traitors death to those who oppose the nation death or revolution
1845812 the church is meddling in political matters like saying that the constitution is statist
1845813 what is happening in the country is alarming there is a frontal and disgusting attack on the part of the president of the republic against the church
1845814 the saturday before last he told the people who go to church to rise up and call the priests liars that the constitution is not abortionist etc
1845815 our pastors bishops and priests who have been verbally attacked are doing a formidable evangelizing work which seeks to illuminate the consciences of all christians
1845816 president your government was inaugurated with a eucharistic celebration because you like the vast majority of ecuadorians are sons of the catholic church
1845817 liberty of expression the liberty of worship the liberty to educate our children in the faith is accompanied by the voice of our pastors
1845818 to silence the voice of the church is to silence the voice of the people is to silence the voice of god

1845824 we just made it available to them it was nice to see a number of them respond
1845825 the thieves focused on major national retail chains like officemax barnes amp noble bjs wholesale club the sports authority and t j maxx the discount clothes retailer that first suggested the existence of the ring early last year when it said its systems had been breached by hackers
1845826 its not going to get cleared out just simply by removing the source i think a lot of people at first thought that beijing or china would be able to manage the air quality there and now its becoming apparent that its not its up to nature
1845827 you know weve had a lot of cases where weve been told the evidence just cant be found and then later it turns up where it wasnt supposed to be
1845828 the little neighbor girl has had a seizure or something
1845829 it was a big wurlitzer organ that came out of the floor with all the bells and whistles he would play it and enthrall the audience
1845830 its an incredible loss to the musical world he was really a world class organist
1845831 he would tell me about the organ in each church we passed
1845832 and whether it was good or not or whether the church was a good place for the organ
1845833 tidak akan diistimewakan dia akan diperlakukan sama dengan yang lain
1845834 its been designed with patient care and satisfaction in mind combining that with state of the art technology in heart and vascular procedures
1845835 whether it is the young creative entrepreneurs working for a local high tech company or residents like we see in south park who are transforming their neighborhoods or the artists who make up our diverse entertainment scene we have many examples of how creative imaginative passionate people are still shaping daytons personality
1845836 just as the wright brothers paul laurence dunbar and charles kettering did in their day we have our own set of creative originals putting their mark on dayton today
1845837 we feel strongly that daytonians and people throughout this region should be the first to appreciate the many great things we have to enjoy
1845838 if locally we can acknowledge and embrace daytons distinct attributes and assets then we can better tell our story to others which helps us compete more successfully for new businesses and residents
1845839 instead we should better promote and capitalize on what makes dayton a good place to live to locate a business or to visit for fun and entertainment
1845840 we are still very much a community that attracts welcomes and rewards originality in ideas actions and character
1845841 these smart creative energetic people are the kind of originals we want to attract and nurture
1845842 they represent an important element to daytons long term success especially as we continue the transition from a heavy manufacturing based economy to one centered around new and emerging technologies
1845843 another in a long line of calculated attacks on cash less cash means fewer withdrawals which means a lower likelihood of a run on a bank which means a greater likelihood of even more ridiculous credit expansion
1845844 ukrainians have long been at the heart of canadian socialism
1845845 they like the collective farm idea just not the mass starvation holodomor thing
1845846 workshops on creating half baked policies that appeal to the worst elements of western canadas rural ukrainian culture
1845847 in the same sentence as your shot your bias is becoming apparent
1845848 but resist the urge to start a cooperative or lobby for a farm subsidy or redistribute albertas oil wealth
1845849 very few of whom i would trust with our sacred western liberties
1845850 personally i couldnt give a fuck about your classical liberal or libertarian minded useless pieces of elitist shit and i mean that sincerely
1845851 a nations culture is the sum of the intellectual achievements of individual men which their fellow citizens have accepted in whole or in part and which have influenced the nations way of life
1845852 when the ukrainians revolted against autocratic czarist rule they mistakenly embraced the utopian sic promise of communism
1845853 the catholics who fled prosecution in the british isles are no different from the ukrainians who fled serfdom in the austro hungarian empire and communism in soviet russia they all came look for freedom including freedom of opinion even if you dont agree with it
1845854 a nations culture is the sum of the intellectual achievements of individual men which their fellow citizens have accepted in whole or in part and which have influenced the nations way of life
1845855 the human rights cabal will not give up this power easily or willingly the power to strip citizens of their natural rights is the essence of bureaucratic totalitarianism
1845856 i do not support abolishing human rights commissions per se but i would at least like them to have the power to dismiss such frivolous complaints with minial inconvenience to the accused if the alberta human rights commission doesnt have that power it should if it does have that power it was grossly abused
1845857 a reasonable person would not consider the republication of the cartoons in the context in which they were republished would expose muslims to the very strong feelings of hatred and contempt

1845866 el gobierno est dispuesto a conceder una recomposici n pero que para determinar cuantitativamente sus alcances tiene que hacer evaluaciones t cnicas y presupuestarias que demandan 15 d as m s
1845867 est dispuesto a plasmar en el acta el compromiso de ofrecer un aumento pero que no pod a establecer un qu ntum
1845868 hasta ayer hab a una postura de intransigencia de los gremios en el sentido de que si no hab a una propuesta espec fica para hoy no iban a levantar el paro y en ese marco se pas a un cuarto intermedio
1845869 el gobierno necesita un plazo para tener el panorama concreto para hacer una propuesta con seriedad y respaldo presupuestario porque el presupuesto es algo din mico hubo factores ex genos que incidieron
1845870 no digo que la provincia est en una situaci n dif cil pero para evitarlo merece un an lisis profundo para hacer una oferta

1845872 nosotros presentamos un pedido de aumento acorde al costo de vida esos porcentajes var an entre un 15 y un 21 por ciento pero no hay un n mero por parte del gobierno sobre el que se pueda discutir
1845873 ese incremento tuvo que ver con actualizar y ajustar desfasajes del a o anterior y poder superarlos no tener que andar siempre corriendo como para cubrir estrictamente la canasta tener una equis cantidad de pesos que nos permita acceder a otros bienes

1845906 supreme court uphold appeals court decision in favour of harpers magazine
1845907 the supreme court has vindicated harpers magazines position that peter turnley took photographs of kyle brinlees funeral with the full permission of the soldiers family at a public event
1845908 the photograph was part of a larger essay and from the beginning we emphasized that it should be viewed in the context of the larger essay depicting iraqi and american war dead
1845909 was an accurate depiction of what any member of the public and press attending this funeral could see i was given permission to attend the funeral and no restrictions were placed on what i could photograph i believe the photograph and the photo essay were newsworthy respectful dignified and of great interest and importance to the citizens of our nation and the world
1845910 for publishing these photographs and for their tremendous support during this case it turned out on the right side for journalism and freedom of the press and the first amendment
1845911 fair and accurate media coverage of official public occasions is in the highest and best interest of the public and cannot be treated as actionable
1845912 this victory is important not just for harpers magazine and peter turnley but for the nations press and its citizens
1845913 it validates the right of the american press to cover newsworthy stories of importance to the american public without the chilling effect of successful lawsuits brought by those who disagree with the content of the stories
1845914 as i worked on the final draft of the first episode of tgt i started thinking to myself how the episode doesnt really tell you that much about who these characters are

1845920 as he searched for cabinet appointees carter seemed at times hesitant and frustrated disconcertingly out of character his lack of ties to washington and the party establishment qualities that helped raise him to the white house carry potential dangers he does not know the federal government or the pressures it creates he does not really know the politicians whom he will need to help him run the country
1845921 nation state as a fundamental unit of mans organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force international banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation state
1845922 the trilateral commission is international and is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the united states the trilateral commission represents a skillful coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political monetary intellectual and ecclesiastical

1845924 the side effects that have been reported are real and they cannot be brushed aside
1845925 physicians have a responsibility to communicate risks to patients and if patients and families are concerned it is reasonable to hold off on vaccinating
1845926 the scientific work to date seems to suggest that aluminum salts in vaccines are safe
1845927 merck has analyzed the adverse events reported for gardasil relating to the recent reports of death and paralysis and based on the data available to merck believes that no safety issue related to the vaccine has been identified these types of events are events that could also be seen in the general population

1845929 i worry about the kids who may be having problems are perhaps struggling with immune damage and are feeling generally achy and unwell but are probably going unreported and undiagnosed
1845930 pasteur was widely supported but on his death bed conceded that beauchamp was right
1845931 even if everyone was vaccinated we would still have cervical cancer
1845932 i dont want people to be lulled into thinking this will prevent cancer if pap screening rates decline cervical cancer rates will rise
1845933 these types of pictures will soon disappear in clinical oncology
1845934 no one would want to wait to see cervical cancer develop in participants
1845935 but the general failure to mention that the precancerous lesions chosen for study are not only potentially removable most those that are cin 2 would probably have resolved on their own without any intervention is arguable
1845936 while vaccine proponents emphasize the many thousands of women who participated in clinical trials of the product they gloss over how few young girls in the 9 to 13 year age range targeted specifically for school based immunizations were included
1845937 we are simply still in the early stages of investigation
1845938 there is no question that early detection will continue to be a key element

1845990 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1845991 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1845992 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media lapdogs

1846020 t he ability to accurately assess proved reserves is an important part of understanding any energy companys financial position but the current oil and gas disclosure rules often interfere with an investors analysis because they are tied to outdated technologies
1846021 new technologies have allowed the rapid emergence of gas shales as a major energy source representing a truly transformative event for u s energy supplies said aubrey mcclendon chairman of acsf and chairman and ceo of
1846022 american producers can clearly supply enough natural gas to meet todays uses and become and economical source of transportation fuel in the form of cng compressed natural gas or greater supplies of electricity for plug in hybrids for generations to come

1846033 no one is allowed to testify if they work for the president
1846034 its much wider than previous administrations have claimed even than nixon claimed
1846035 and the fact of the matter is i think something like that will not stand up in court
1846036 if i was the president i wouldnt be too worried about this congress either
1846037 the fact that they have taken no action against karl rove almost a week after he refused to even show up to assert his privilege sure makes it seem like theyre willing to take it on the chin and avoid taking any action to enforce these subpoenas

1846051 oil and natural gas exploration is not simple and it is not easy it requires geological ingenuity advanced technologies and the time to do the job right
1846052 it also requires access to areas where exploration ideas can be tested the greater the number of areas available for exploration the higher the chance of finding oil and natural gas traps

1846059 the notorious marquis of nash is a creature of the night his wealth and his title provide but a tenuous entr e into polite society but when nash leaves his lair for a rare foray into the ton and enjoys a moment of heated passion with a mysterious lady in the dark he develops an obsession which will lead him into the hellish world of smugglers spies and political intrigue as the continent edges nearer to war xanthia neville has arrived in london to expand her familys most lucrative business holding neville shipping with her brother rothewell all too happy to waste his life in debauchery xanthia opens up shop in londons grimy docklands all the while flaunting the tons silly strictures about how a lady ought to behave but london she soon learns is not barbados and when the british government approaches rothewell to ask the familys help in exposing a dangerous arms dealer xanthia must enter society after all only to find her loyalties torn but can xanthias subterfuge prove him a traitor to the crown before her heart is broken

1846066 the amazing thing is he keeps coming out here every single year trying to get better
1846067 i think thats why he maintains such a high level of play
1846068 hes still the same guy who tells us whether to look for a run or a pass still the same guy who talks it up before the snap
1846069 youd think in your 13th training camp youd sort of slow down but not ray he runs the show
1846070 its great to have an opportunity to coach a football team that ray lewis is on
1846071 just watching practice today you can see why hes one of the all time greats and a first ballot hall of famer and why he believes hes got of football left in him because he does
1846072 i think age is for everybody else whos done it before and still wants to do it or someone who doesnt want to pay you a whole lot of money

1846085 he would hope to provide tax benefits and financial benefits to companies who would provide those services to low income users and rural users
1846086 the problem in rural parts of america are that the economics are not nearly as compelling as they are in metropolises like new york or chicago or los angeles and it may require some government assistance either through financial subsidy policy or other kinds of creative tools like community or municipal broadband services that help bring those people into the cosmos of technology and connects them to the wonderful benefits that the net provides
1846087 this is fundamentally about economic development its about making sure that people in rural areas can participate in the information age
1846088 and could i mention that senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that

1846091 when most of the boys in the choir were twelve years of age they had to be confirmed by the bishop i was not twelve but between nine and ten when the bishop laid his hands on me i can remember that as he imposed his hands i had a similar experience to the one i had forty years later when i was baptized in the holy spirit my whole body was filled with the consciousness of gods presence a consciousness that remained with me for days after the confirmation service all the other boys were swearing and quarreling and i wondered what had made the difference between them and me
1846092 i had the grounding in bible teaching among the plymouth brethren i marched under the blood and fire banner of the salvation army learning to win souls in the open air i received the second blessing of sanctification and a clean heart under the teaching of reader harris and the pentecostal league i claimed the gift of the holy spirit by faith as i waited ten days before the lord but in sunderland in 1907 i knelt before god and had an acts 2 4 experience
1846093 she mrs boddy a ministers wife laid her hands on me and then had to go out of the room the fire fell it was a wonderful time as i was there with god alone he bathed me in power i was conscience of the cleansing of the precious blood and i cried out clean clean clean i was filled with the joy of the consciousness of the cleansing i was given a vision in which i saw the lord jesus christ i beheld the empty cross and i saw him exalted at the right hand of god the father i could speak no longer in english but i began to praise him in other tongues as the spirit of god gave me utterance i knew then although i might have received anointings previously that now at last i had received the real baptism in the holy spirit as they received on the day of pentecost
1846094 i believe gods ministers are to be flames of fire nothing less than flames nothing less than mighty instruments with burning messages with hearts full of love they must have a depth of consecration that god has taken full charge of the body and it exists only that it may manifest the glory of god a baptism into death in which the person is purified and energized
1846095 every sermon that christ preached was prefaced by a model miracle we are going to follow his example the first person in this large audience that stands up whatever his or her sickness ill pray for that one and god will deliver him or her
1846096 my friend said she is dead he was scared i have never seen a man so frightened in my life what shall i do he asked you may think that what i did was absurd but i reached over into the bed and pulled her out i carried her across the room stood her against the wall and held her up as she was absolutely dead i looked into her face and said in the name of jesus i rebuke this death from the crown of her head to the soles of her feet her whole body began to tremble in the name of jesus i command you to walk i said i repeated in the name of jesus in the name of jesus walk and she walked
1846097 although his life was a combination of incessant prayer and praise and every word and work was an act of worship he was not given to protracted periods of fasting and prayer

1846101 you must every day make higher ground you must deny yourself to make progress with god you must refuse everything that is not pure and holy god wants you pure in heart he wants you to have an intense desire after holiness two things will get you to leap out of yourselves into the promises of god today one is purity and the other is faith which is kindled more and more by purity

1846172 asking the same environmental and planning questions but getting answers more quickly
1846173 you know what guys were going to give you some cash and you spend it the way you want after all you know better than us
1846174 hey check out how many gs i can put this baby through
1846175 we will not walk in fear one of another we will not be driven into an age of unreason if we dig deep into our history and remember we are not descended from fearful men
1846176 this is the first time weve demonstrated a camera on a curved surface to really make it look like a human eye
1846177 if you simply bend it those materials are brittle like a ceramic bowl they break
1846178 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
1846179 currently when you take photos the middle part of the picture is very clear but when you go to the edge it is not so clear
1846180 it really extends to all of the electronics that we use on humans you want to have a curved surface to fit the human body that is really the place it can be used
1846181 if you want to develop an eye to replace a human eye certainly you want the shape to look like a human eye
1846182 i look at the data a lot and its very rare ive almost never seen this to see the transaction price of a new vehicle rise after it has been sold
1846183 it speaks to the huge imbalance between supply and demand of the prius
1846184 we discourage dealers from marking up cars above list price because it adversely affects customer satisfaction
1846185 that said toyota has no direct control over dealer pricing as they are independent businessmen
1846186 there is no excess inventory that is not likely to change until our new mississippi plant comes online in 2010 and begins to assemble the prius

1846192 what jumped out at me is how the advertising on the player makes the experience look closer to the gaudiness of myspace than the sterility of google
1846193 one of the most beautiful and extraordinary aviation vehicles ever developed
1846194 now we know that it was the tank that exploded and thats good
1846195 but tracking down the sequence of events that led to the explosion is more important
1846196 ive never seen an instance where a cylinder exploded on a 747 like this its unusual
1846197 if they dont believe in the value of the cars they dont want to take the risk essentially why would the customers

1846199 while they are bringing more people to ride buses and trains all across the country public transit agencies are facing challenges to meet their costs
1846200 at a time that ridership is at an all time high and people are desperate to use mass transit we are in a terrible spot
1846201 if you drive or bike to work what would it take to make public transportation a viable option for your commute
1846202 if they were 15 minutes apart i would definately buy a bus pass for my 1 1 mile commute to work

1846211 airlines need to sell seats not give them away which is why there are all these partnerships out there
1846212 a seed of information can lead to a groundswell of action
1846213 the creation of a leader who was a self made man
1846214 the leader is not the architect of the system but its product george w bush no more created inverted totalitarianism than he piloted the plane onto the uss abraham lincoln
1846215 the united states has become the showcase of how democracy can be managed without appearing to be suppressed
1846216 the new system with its emphasis upon a strong executive an indirectly elected senate composed it was hoped of the educated and wealthy and an appointed supreme court also represented the fears of the founders
1846217 the great essential interests of a nation which are so plain that every one may understand them as every individual is interested all have an equal right to declare their interests and to have them regarded
1846218 the american political system was not born a democracy but born with a bias against democracy
1846219 a lasting fault line on the one side a national establishment and preserve gee like a nature preserve for an elite politics concerned with the grand issues of war defense diplomacy regulation of commerce national credit and public finance and whose operations were to be regular efficient and well administered on the other a collection of decentralized societies whose politics and culture displayed as virtually every foreign observer attested democratic and egalitarian tendencies rowdiness irregular local loyalties a parochial suspicion toward a remote power claiming sovereignty over local life and a destabilizing politics often
1846220 deliberation discussion and reconciliation of opposing viewpoints all of which suddenly seem time consuming
1846221 to act politically against their own material interests and potential power
1846222 yearn for political stability rather than civic engagement protection rather than political involvement
1846223 it was a tesla customer who got into that accident were aware of it because we service our vehicles
1846224 there was extensive recording switching between police officers to compare notes writing writing writing more than ive seen in an average accident especially because they couldnt believe the statements they were trying to establish the fact of the cars unnoticeability
1846225 the rear ending caused him to go under the car in front of him my guess is thats why the airbags didnt deploy
1846226 blind people at crosswalks should stop whining about quiet electric cars

1846230 i can see my father right now up in heaven in his rocking chair shaking his head in amazement that we are all here today just for him
1846231 my father understood what was important he often told me treat people with respect encourage those around you make the most of every day watching him live by those words proved to be the greatest lesson of all
1846232 he had an easy oklahoma politeness and a modesty that isnt normally associated with elite athletes he was a fans player and he was a players player
1846233 he was just terrific kid who was handed an oversized assignment and he handled it with grace and honesty and dignity as he did everything until the very end he made you a better person just to know him no man ever wore the new york yankee uniform better and in this measure he is in fact right there with babe and lou and joe and mickey he had yankee dna a yankee for life the most beloved yankee of his time
1846234 if you didnt know bobby very well you would think that baseball was it for bobby
1846235 not even close family was it for bobby he was a family man from start to finish baseball was what bobby did but it wasnt who he was
1846236 if i could draw up a prototype of what i wanted my idol to be
1846237 bobby murcer lived up to being that person bobby murcer was the most genuine famous person that i have ever met
1846238 but now i have a greater purpose in playing baseball
1846239 im playing for bobby now bobby is now my guardian angel
1846240 about a block from the stadium a car stopped and out stepped bobby murcer
1846241 mccain could dismiss w as a lightweight but he knows obamas smart obama wrote his own books while mccains were written by salter
1846242 yea whenever i get sick i get these large spots all over my tongue like red circles or just big places where those things on the top of my tongue that make it look normal are just absent
1846243 yea that is exactly what it looks like sometimes worse
1846244 yea it is called geographic tongue because the spots can look like huge continents on your tongue it probably happens not only when youre sick but i bet when you are really stressed out as well kind of like your teeth grinding
1846245 the central asian uighurs know a great deal about the two east turkestan periods of sovereign rule and they reflect on that quite frequently
1846246 bind xinjiang more closely to the rest of the prc
1846247 the congressional executive commission on china said the chinese government
1846248 uighurs feel like this is their homeland that these resources should be more devoted to them
1846249 ethnic tension is fanned by economic disparity the han tend to be wealthier than the uighurs in xinjiang
1846250 one common problem of the western region is that the education and cultural level of the people here is quite low
1846251 etim is probably defunct by now as far as we know
1846252 xinhua a state run newspaper chinese rights organizations refuted the amnesty report saying it was designed to experts disagree on the efficacy of chinas counterterrorism measures
1846253 prevent any emergence of linkages between uighur communities in these countries and xinjiang
1846254 some enrolled in madrassas some enrolled with the anti taliban opposition force the northern alliance some enrolled with the taliban some enrolled with the islamic movement of uzbekistan
1846255 people arent threatening to boycott the olympic opening ceremony for the uighurs
1846256 for the uighurs their most prominent spokesperson is rebiya kadeer in washington who really doesnt have the infrastructure and the nobel prize that the dalai lama has
1846257 theres no international pressure to change policy in xinjiang right now
1846258 could you get children to write a description of their characters and produce a 3d model that looks like that character
1846259 the laborious process of creating a game artifact should be rewarded by allowing you to keep these things maybe even pass them on to other children to use in their own games
1846260 what do you do when your friends dad comes to drive you home from a party and you can tell that he is drunk
1846261 its like a stealthy way of getting them to write
1846262 this idea that we can only deal with narratives as complete things seems to me completely wrong we enjoy taking the little bits and putting them together ourselves
1846263 secondary school students are regarded as too old and too mature for stories rubbish
1846264 like having chapters 1 5 and 9 of harry potter
1846265 who is responsible for macbeths actions is it macbeth lady macbeth the witches
1846266 i feel very very strongly that we should stop teaching children as if they are empty vessels into which we knowledgeable people should pour information
1846267 look gods dwelling place is now among the people and he will dwell with them they will be his people and god himself will be with them and be their god he will wipe every tear from their eyes there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain for the old order of things has passed away
1846268 write this down for these words are trustworthy and true
1846269 it is done i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end to the thirsty i will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life those who are victorious will inherit all this and i will be their god and they will be my children
1846270 it is our will to invoke sex force and attraction
1846271 to alert the church about the previously unheard of dangers to children from satanic cults worldwide
1846272 according to government statistics some 39 000 children were sexually abused last year
1846273 i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shall bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee
1846274 and now my dear i would suggest that we enter into the pursuit of those curious pleasures about which you were recently telling me
1846275 since there is no one of these pleasures but is purchased by some diversion of mans nature yet first as i need hardly inform you there is a ceremonial to be observed
1846276 footnote re this passage this short passage is too shocking to
1846277 and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost
1846278 break break break at the foot of thy stones o sea and i would that i could utter the thoughts that arise in me

1846324 the time has come for us to make the proposed uc merced medical school a priority by providing state resources for the project i am committed to advancing this cause and i urge my fellow legislators the governor the uc board of regents and other decision makers involved in the process to do the same
1846325 a great lawyer tells his client that he or she has a bad case when its true
1846326 at least half the time the great lawyer will be telling the client to put the checkbook away and discourage litigation
1846327 the great lawyers take the world as it is and sell their perceptive analysis of what they see celebrity lawyers in contrast boast of being able to turn white black and black white
1846328 the great lawyer has to be supremely competent with the language whether writing or speaking
1846329 the great lawyer has to be widely read and receptive to ideas always moving to where the best vantage point of reality can be found
1846330 its a tough report and much of it could remain classified
1846331 the palestinians expressed satisfaction in light of the steps taken and requested to continue to strengthen the palestinian security forces and realm of authority
1846332 during the meeting which was conducted in a positive atmosphere both sides agreed to hold additional such meetings in the future
1846333 the report needs to be looked at as part of an american domestic power struggle and is less about israel and its policies in the territories
1846334 the report will have more criticism for the diplomatic echelon in israel and the us
1846335 it will also criticize dayton since the report will conclude that law enforcement institutions which dayton was supposed to help create do not really exist
1846336 take the middle east seriously because thats the center of thats the place where people get so despondent and despair that theyre willing to come and take lives of us citizens

1846341 it is perfect tarantino material he wanted to get britney first shes playing the most important character
1846342 though she definitely intends to explore acting roles down the road right now shes concentrating on recording her next album
1846343 i think people should maintain an open mind and withhold judgment until the evidence is in
1846344 they were all fleeing the scene when they were struck
1846345 we dont know if the 12 year old got in willingly or was pulled in
1846346 i didnt take any notice because you hear stuff all the time ive called police before and they dont come because theres parties in there all the time
1846347 often when you get a call for a car behind a high school it could be people smoking dope or a couple making out
1846348 its a few minutes later that we go back and check the scene and find her
1846349 police acted very quickly he was arrested and perhaps prevented a very serious crime from taking place

1846352 i was pitching well in triple a and i felt like i wasnt going to go anywhere
1846353 were the same three jerks we always were im actually quite proud of the fact that its gone on as long as it has
1846354 but not really to the extent where we were able to clear up all of our misconceptions about each other
1846355 it was really good for us to figure out what made the band work and what didnt work so we could appreciate each other unconfused by these other issues
1846356 as were getting more into it and less uptight about living the legend it is actually becoming the stuff that got us here
1846357 it was the commitment in the beginning that made it possible that it was a finite commitment that has actually made it a lot of fun
1846358 im fully prepared to say that was it were fine and were done
1846359 on the other hand im fully prepared if someone comes back in a couple of years and says we ought to give it a go you have to consider it
1846360 a lot of bands like the eagles and probably numerous other ones everyone sort of matures and they realize that its fantastic business and the impetuosity that comes with being very young and walking away from something that is really successful you kind of get over that
1846361 its evocative of what we were originally going for dark heavy and ambiguous and doesnt automatically give people an idea of what we are
1846362 some band names you hear and you know exactly what the band was going to sound like
1846363 we were planning on doing something that wouldnt allow us to be pigeonholed easily we wanted a name to reflect that to be able to evolve throughout the years
1846364 we looked at the songs we were writing and said these are cool songs we like them a lot we might not even need a vocalist so we took a chance and played a few shows as an instrumental three piece we felt this is different this is new so we decided to keep going down that road
1846365 now we feel like we dont have to be any one thing
1846366 if the song needs vocals then we can put them there if the song needs to be instrumental we could put that there if its a song thats just drums we can do that we feel like were taking it on our own terms asking the song what it wants if you want to get ethereal like that
1846367 i remember at 4 or 5 years old i would climb everywhere what is a wire walker if he doesnt climb in high places i had that feeling as a toddler of working on my destiny
1846368 the story is so unbelievable you have to see it really to believe it

1846393 what was clear to me and clear to us is we had a huge opportunity to create content that were boys favorites
1846394 youre fighting the brand perception the very very strong brand equity thats been in the marketplace for many many years
1846395 it would almost require a complelely separate effort to reach tween boys with a completely different name somehow associated with the disney property to reach these tween males
1846396 what we heard loud and clear is they expect from disney this broad array
1846397 they want a place essentially a headquarters for them where their favorite content exists that has this broad array of shapes and sizes and tenors and complexities and treats them with the respect that disney channel treats all kids and the girls are fanatical about
1846398 simply put people the world over can breathe easier because this resolution will institutionalize the commitment of the house of representatives to confronting global warming
1846399 youre not going to use my committee on the floor
1846400 in the house of representatives debate on global warming has been stifled for 12 years
1846401 were paying more taxes on our property i think people are fed up with that

1846406 is urine to be a doctor you have to be observant of color smell sight and taste
1846407 if any of you had been observant you would have noticed that i put my second finger into the jar and my third finger into my mouth
1846408 ill need a urine sample a feces sample and a blood sample
1846409 i need a urine sample a feces sample and a blood sample
1846410 doctor this was working for a while but i cant seem to get rid of these bags under my eyes
1846411 ill be home when i want if i want and at what time i want
1846412 and i dont expect any hassle from you also i expect a decent meal to be on the table every evening unless i tell you otherwise ill go hunting fishing boozing and card playing with my buddies whenever i want those are my rules
1846413 no thats fine with me but just understand that therell be sex here at seven oclock every night whether youre here or not
1846414 you know i dont know what else to do whenever i go home after weve been out drinking i turn the headlights off before i get to the driveway i shut off the engine and coast into the garage i take my shoes off before i go into the house i sneak up the stairs i get undressed in the bathroom i ease into bed and my wife still wakes up and yells at me for staying out so late
1846415 well youre obviously taking the wrong approach i screech into the driveway slam the door storm up the steps throw my shoes into the closet jump into bed rub my hands on my wifes ass and say how about a blowjob and shes always sound asleep
1846416 oh it was awful i was sure my wife was having an affair so i came home early to catch her with him i searched all over the apartment but couldnt find him anywhere so i went out onto the balcony we live on the 25th floor and found this man hanging over the edge by his fingertips i went inside got a hammer and started hitting his hands he fell but landed in some bushes so i got the refrigerator and pushed it over the balcony and it crushed him the strain of the act gave me a heart attack and i died
1846417 i was doing aerobics on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment when i twisted my ankle and slipped over the edge i managed to grab the balcony of the apartment below but some maniac came out and started pounding on my fingers with a hammer luckily i landed in some bushes but then the guy dropped a refrigerator on me
1846418 now class im going to reach into the bag and describe a piece of fruit and you tell what fruit im talking about okay first its round plumb and red
1846419 no deborah its a beet but i like your thinking
1846420 no billy im afraid its a potato but i like your thinking
1846421 hey ive got one for you teacher let me put my hand in my pocket okay ive got it its round hard and it got a head on it
1846422 oh my god help me theres a bee in my vagina
1846423 hmm tricky situation but i have a solution to the problem if young sir would permit
1846424 ok what im gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wifes vagina when i feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my dick i shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wifes vagina
1846425 i dont think the bee has noticed the honey yet perhaps i should go a bit deeper
1846426 now wait a minute what the hell do you think youre doing
1846427 because pretty much everyone you meet on this job is going to lie to you
1846428 was he really all that disgruntled or was he on to something that everyone else just glosses over
1846429 i couldnt have done it i was at a friends house
1846430 i thought you said that she was your friend you dont know your friends last name
1846431 i mean was it by the main doors the movie theater a specific restaurant what
1846432 she lives in some apartments i dont really know for sure
1846433 okay why dont you hop in and you can point out where this girl lives
1846434 i thought you just said that she left with her mom
1846435 are you asking me if there were 4 people or are you telling me that there were 4 people
1846436 are you asking me if her name was misty or are you telling me that her name was misty
1846437 okay lets have you show me where her apartment is
1846438 i know but i can always come back later to talk with her right
1846439 oh i know and you should be because just like fossil fuels your integrity is a non renewable resource that cannot be re made re grown or regenerated on a scale comparative to its consumption
1846440 get a lot of money so i dont have to worry about you
1846441 my earliest fantasies revolved around being kidnapped by beautiful women and held hostage
1846442 eugh look at all that road kill do you never clean your gear
1846443 hot and cold when it came to afghanistan and chasing al qaeda

1846448 we met in a bookstore but if you could choose where do you wish we met
1846449 imagine we could have met anywhere in the world anywhere where would you have liked for us to meet or put it this way where would you like to meet the love of your life
1846450 i think it would be nice to meet at wimbledon to have seats next to each other during the mixed doubles championships
1846451 it would be nicer if we were playing on opposite teams so i could watch you jump around in your cute tennis outfit
1846452 can i ask you something how does a woman feel to hear a man grunt like that
1846453 not the same way a man feels to hear a woman scream like that
1846454 thats why i come to hear the women screaming you mean youre here for the playing
1846455 really i wear tennis shoes and i play marco polo in swimming pools but thats about as much sports as i do
1846456 when i was single i decided i wouldnt marry a man unless i could be proud if we had a son who turned out exactly like him
1846457 m sorry to say this but those who are most worthy of love are never made happy by it
1846458 dont be a martyred slave to time get drunk with wine poetry or virtue as you choose
1846459 i think i have a blood clot in my leg
1846460 who is that guy and pointed to the far end of the track i paid that no mind but he put my phone back and took off
1846461 allegedly a 14 year old girl looks to be about 60 i say that with concern and love she allegedly wants to be a singer and or actor slash performer of some sort striptease person i dont know
1846462 the higher you put someone on a pedestal the further they have to fall
1846463 but first you must accomplish five small tasks to prove your readiness can you do it
1846464 your first task is to go our into the world and learn how to be silent
1846465 you must go out into the world and learn to be happy no matter what happens you must be able to stay at peace within
1846466 you must grow your hair very long and your beard very long and find some old clothes that you never change
1846467 now you must go and learn how to want nothing
1846468 i now know how to want nothing in fact i now dont want to be your student
1846469 ah but youve not passed this last test you now want not to want and isnt that just another want
1846470 i now know how not to want i have come to see that i have become you so there is nothing between us i dont want to leave because you are me and i cant leave me i dont want to stay because to be here is pure emptiness i am looking at myself
1846471 now you are my student you can leave or stay either way you are my student you are now ready to learn
1846472 youll be attracted to those things people and places that help you fulfil your purpose
1846473 theres one dish that nothing but a cast iron skillet will do cornbread why if you bake it in anything else cornbread will not achieve the desired crispy crust now i dont want to start a debate about cornbread but it is a fact that there are differences between northern and texan cornbread northerners like it sweet while texans like it salty we are also known to jazz it up with jalapenos green chiles or cheese but the one thing a texan will never ever put into their cornbread is sugar that said my mom who has a legendary sweet tooth admits to putting honey in hers so i have to question her texan creditentials but never mind that cornbread is for dinner not dessert heres a classic texan cornbread recipe baked in a cast iron skillet of course be sure and get the cast iron good and hot as thats what sears the batter and makes for a crispy crunchy crust
1846474 sir i was wondering if you wanted to buy this wedding ring
1846475 i do they wouldnt take it at the pawn shop but i really need the money to buy my baby some diapers
1846476 i think the manager is still trying to add one or two faces but if he doesnt do that in the next week or so im sure with the players weve got in the squad im pretty sure we can do well again
1846477 marius was a very good player he did well with us he managed to score eight league goals or something like that i dont see why andy barrowman cant equal that or do better than that
1846478 marius wasnt an out and out sort of striker he wasnt all about scoring goals he liked to play the assists and obviously losing an international player is a loss but the manager has brought andy in and is trying to get adam rooney from stoke so im sure the two of them will do well
1846479 la segunda conclusi n es que la creencia en certezas una premisa fundamental de la modernidad ciega y mutila la ciencia moderna esto es la ciencia cartesiana newtoniana se ha basado en la certeza de certeza la suposici n b sica es que existen leyes universales objetivas que gobiernan todos los fen menos naturales que estas leyes pueden ser descubiertas por la investigaci n cient fica y que una vez que tales leyes son conocidas podemos pronosticar perfectamente el futuro y el pasado a partir de cualquier conjunto de valores para las condiciones iniciales
1846480 la tercera conclusi n es que en los sistemas sociales humanos los m s complejos del universo por lo que resultan a n m s dif ciles de analizar la lucha por una buena sociedad es un rasgo permanente
1846481 la cuarta conclusi n que extraigo es que la incertidumbre es maravillosa y que la certeza si fuera real ser a la muerte moral

1846531 ini adalah jawaban yang sangat indah dari said bin musayyab rahimahullah dan senjata yang kuat untuk mematahkan argumen ahlu bidah yang menganggap baik tumbuh suburnya bidah dengan alasan demi menghidupkan dzikir dan shalat mereka tidak senang kepada ahlus sunnah yang mengkritik perbuatan mereka yang menganggap bahwa ahlus sunnah anti dzikir dan shalat padahal hakikatnya ahlus sunnah mengingkari mereka itu adalah karena mereka menyalahi sunnah dalam dzikir shalat dan yang lainnya
1846532 sebab demikian itu bukan amal mereka dan juga bukan usaha mereka karena itu rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam tidak memerintahkan kepada umatnya tidakmenganjurkannya dan tidak membimbing kepadanya dengan dalil maupun dengan isyarat dan tidak terdapat dalil tentang hal itu dari seorang sahabatpun semoga allah meridhai mereka jika hal itu baik niscaya mereka mendahului kita dengan amalan itu sesungguhnya masalah ibadah hanya terbatas pada nahs dan tidak berlaku qiyas maupun pendapat
1846533 demikian ini bidah kalau begitu mobil bidah listrik bidah jam bidah
1846534 barangsiapa melakukan hal yang baru dalam urusan agama kami ini yang tidak ada didalamnya maka amal itu ditolak
1846535 bab wajib mengikuti perkataan nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam tentang kehidupan dunia berdasarkan pendapat
1846536 dan menghalalkan bagi mereka segala hal yang baik dan mengharamkan bagi mereka segala hal yang buruk
1846537 sesungguhnya amal amal manusia terbagi kepada pertama ibadah yang mereka jadikan sebagai agama yang bermanfaat bagi mereka di akhirat atau bermanfaat dalam kehidupan mereka adapun kaidah dalam hukum adalah asal dalam bentuk bentuk ibadah tidak disyariatkan kecuali apa yang telah disyariatkan allah sedangkan hukum asal dalam adat 7 adalah tidak dilarang kecuali apa yang dilarang allah
1846538 hal hal tersebut tiada kaitannya dengan hakikat ibadah tetapi hal tersebut harus diperhatikan dari sisi dasarnya apakah dia bertentangan dengan hukum hukum syariat ataukah masuk didalamnya
1846539 sesungguhnya hal hal yang berkaitan dengan adat jika dilihat dari sisi adatnya maka tidak ada bidah di dalamnya tetapi jika adat dijadikan sebagai ibadah atau diletakkan pada tempat ibadah maka ia menjadi bidah
1846540 tidak setiap yang belum ada pada masa nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan juga belum ada pada masa khulafa rasyidin dinamakan bidah sebab setiap ilmu yang baru dan bermanfaat bagi manusia wajib dipelajari oleh sebagian kaum muslimin agar menjadi kekuatan mereka dan dapat meningkatkan eksistensi umat islam sesungguhnya bidah adalah sesuatu yang baru dibuat oleh manusia dalam bentuk bentuk ibadah saja sedangkan yang bukan dalam masalah ibadah dan tidak bertentangan dengan kaidah kaidah syariat maka bukan bidah sama sekali
1846541 adapun adat adalah sesuatu yang bias dilakukan manusia dalam urusan dunia yang berkaitan dengan kebutuhan mereka dan hukum asal pada masalah tersebut adalah tidak terlarang
1846542 apakah mereka mempunyai para sekutu yang mensyariatkan untuk mereka agama yang tidak diizinkan allah
1846543 adapun adat dan muamallah maka bukan allah pencetusnya tetapi manusialah yang mencetuskan dan berinteraksi dengannya sedang allah datang membetulkan meluruskan dan membina serta menetapkannya pada suatu waktu dalam hal hal yang tidak mengandung mafsadat dan mudharat
1846544 barang siapa yang diberi petunjuk oleh allah maka dialah yang mendapat petunjuk dan barang siapa yang disesatkan allah maka merekalah orang orang yang merugi
1846545 maka pernahkah kamu melihat orang yang menjadikan hawa nafsunya sebagai tuhannya dan allah membiarkannya sesat berdasarkan ilmu nya dan allah telah mengunci mati pendengaran dan hatinya dan meletakkan tutupan atas penglihatannya maka siapakah yang akan memberinya petunjuk sesudah allah membiarkannya sesat maka mengapa kamu tidak mengambil pelajaran
1846546 kelihatannya persoalan halal dan haram untuk pertama kalinya sangat mudah tetapi pada kenyataannya sangat sulit pengarang pada masa masa lalu ataupun sekarang ini belum ada yang menulis secara khusus persoalan tersebut akan tetapi penulis sendiri menjumpainya berserakan dalam beberapa persoalan fiqih islam dan dalam beberapa kitab tafsir dan hadits nabawi
1846547 andaikata kebenaran itu menuruti hawa nafsu mereka pasti binasalah langit dan bumi ini dan semua yang ada didalamnya
1846548 katakanlah apakah diantara sekutu sekutumu ada yang menunjuki kepada kebenaran maka apakah orang yang menunjuki kepada kebenaran itu lebih berhak diikuti ataukah orang yang tidak dapat memberi petunjuk kecuali bila diberi petunjuk mengapa kamu berbuat demikian bagaimankah kamu mengambil keputusan
1846549 tidak menaruh kepercayaan terhadap orang yang ditaklidinya sementara taklid itu sendiri berarti mengabaikan fungsi akal karena akal diciptakan untuk berfikir dan merenung sungguh buruk orang yang diberi pelita untuk menerangi jalan tetapi justru pelita itu dimatikan sementara dia rela berjalan dalam kegalapan
1846550 tiap tiap orang boleh diambil perkataannya dan boleh ditinggalkan kecuali nabi saw
1846551 pendapatku benar tetapi mungkin juga mengandung kekeliruan dan pendapat orang lain salah tetapi mungkin mengandung kebenaran
1846552 janganlah kamu mengenal kebenaran karena tokohnya tetapi kenalilah kebenaran itu sendiri niscaya kamu akan tahu siapa ahlinya
1846553 barangsiapa menahan anggurnya pada masa menuai panen untuk menjualnya kepada orang yahudi atau nasrani atau orang yang hendak menjadikannyakhamr maka sesungguhnya dia menerjang api neraka dengan sengaja
1846554 sanadnya hasan sebaimana dikatakan oleh al hafizh dan hadits ini juga diriwayatkan oleh baihaqi dengan tambahan
1846555 janganlah kamu menjual budak budak perempuan penyanyi dan jangan pula kamu membelinya serta jagnan pula mengajarimereka tidak ada kebaikan dalam memperjualbelikan mereka dan harganya adalah haram
1846556 wahaiayah abdur tahman seesungguhnya kami memberli buah kurmna dan anggur lalu kami peras untuk kami jadikan khamr kemudian kami jual
1846557 ini adalah kekeliruan yang tidak saya ketahuidarimana sumbernya karena ini adalah kekeliruan yang amat buruk
1846558 tidaklah seorang muslim membunuh seekor burung atau lainnya degan tanpa hak bukan untuk dimanfaatkan melainkan allah azza wa jalla akan meminta pertanggungjawaban kepadanya
1846559 barangsiapa membunuh seekor burung dengan sia sia maka burung itu akan berteriak lapor kepada allah pada hari kiamat seraya berkata ya tuhanku sesungguhnya si fulan telah membunuhku dengan sia sia bukan untuk memanfaatkanku
1846560 barangsiapa diserahi jabatan menjadi hakim maka sesungguhnya dia telah disembelih tanpa menggunakan pisau
1846561 kebenarannya mengandung kemungkinan kemungkinan tetapi dia orang yang benar jujur
1846562 sesungguhnya persyaratan nasai tentang hadits ini lebih ketat daripada abu daud dan tirmidzi
1846563 dilemahkan oleh imam ahmad dan lainnya tetapi dianggap dapat dipercaya oleh imam abu hatim dan imam muslim
1846564 sesungguhnya allah telah mewajibkan beberapa kewajiban maka janganlah kamu menyia nyiakannya dan allah telah menetukan beberapa batas maka janganlah kamu melanggarnya dan allah telah mengharamkan sesuatu maka janganlah kamu merusaknya dan allah mendiamkan beberapa hal karena sayanga kepadamu bukan karena dia lupa maka janganlah kamu mencarinya
1846565 apa yang dihalalkan allah adalah halal dan apa yang diharamkan nya adalah haram dan apa yang didiamkan nya berarti dimaafkan
1846566 barangsiapa yang menimbun makanan ketika masyarakat sedang membutuhkannya selama empat puluh hari maka dia telah lepas hubungannya dari allah dan allah pun lepas darinya
1846567 ya allah sesungguhnya aku berlindung kepada mu dari lilitan utang dan tekanan orang lain
1846568 ya allah sesungguhnya aku berlindung kepada mu dari kesusahan dan kesedihan
1846569 di dalam sandnya terdapat abdul karim bin abdul karim abu hatim berkata haditsnya menunjukkan kebohongan
1846570 abdul karim bin abdul karim al bajali dari abdullah ibnu umar yang jabarah bin al mughlas meriwayatkan darinya adalah lurus haditsnya
1846571 kata bidah jika disebutkan secara mutlak maka maksudnya adalah perkara baru yang tidak baik yang ada dalam agama
1846572 kata bidah berasal dari kata al ikhtira yaitu sesuau yang baru diciptakan tanpa ada contoh sebelumnya
1846573 katakanlah aku bukanlah rasul yang pertama di antara rasul rasul
1846574 sesuatu yang diperbuat oleh hati dikatakan lisan dan dilakukan oleh anggota badan
1846575 kata bidah jika disebutkan secara mutlak maka maksudnya adalah perkara baru yang tidak baik yang ada dalam agama
1846576 badi mubtada dan bidah adalah hal baru dalam agama setelah agama dinyatakan sempurna
1846577 cara baru dalam agama yang disebut untuk menyerupai syariat dengan maksud untuk melebihkan dalam beribadah kepada allah
1846578 ungkapan cara baru dalam agama itu maksudnya bahwa cara yang dibuat itu disandarkan oleh pembuatnya kepada agama
1846579 dan aku tidak menciptakan jin dan manusia melainkan supaya mereka beribadah kepada ku
1846580 sesuatu yang diadakan setelah nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam wafat baik berupa ucapan maupun perbuatan
1846581 suatu perbuatan yang belum ada pada tiga abad pertama dan tidak terdapat dasarnya dalam empat sumber hukum ix 351
1846582 rasulullah menorehkan sebuah garis di atas tanah dengan jarinya lalu bersabda ini adalah jalan allah yang lurus
1846583 bukanlah tanggungjawabmu untuk memberi petunjuk kepada mereka tetapi allah lah yang memberi petunjuk kepada siapa yang ia kehendaki
1846584 allahuma ya allah tunjukilah kaumku sebab mereka itu adalah orang orang yang tidak tahu kebenaran
1846585 dakwah ini adalah dakwah yang putih bersih tak terwarnai oleh warna apapun ia selalu memperjuangkan kebenaran dimanapun juga ia berada menganjurkan persatuan dan tidak suka perpecahan dan hendaknya diketahui bahwa bahaya paling besar yang dihadapi kaum muslimin sekarang ini adalah perpecahan dan perselisihan sedangkan asas bagi setiap kemenangan tak lain adalah persatuan dan kasih sayang dan hendaknya diketahui pula bahwa perjuangan umat ini tidak akan memberikan hasil yang baik sepanjang bertolak dari awal yang baik pula
1846586 amar maruf nahyu munkar menegakkan kehidupan atas asas yang maruf dan mensucikannya dari noda kemunkaran
1846587 wahai orang orang yang beriman bertakwalah kepada allah dengan takwa yang sebenar benarnya dan janganlah kamu mati kecuali dalam keadaan berserah diri kepada allah berpegang teguhlah kamu sekalian pada tali allah dan jangan bercerai berai dan ingatlah nikmat allah kepadamu di saat kamu saling bermusuhan lalu ia persatukan hati hatimu sehingga dengan karunia nya itu kamu menjadi bersaudara saat itu kamu berada ditubir jurang neraka kehancuran lalu ia selamatkan kamu darinya demikianlah allah menerangkan kepadamu ayat ayat nya agar kamu mendapat petunjuk
1846588 dan hendaklah ada diantaramu satu umat yang menyeru berbuat kebaikan menyeru yang maruf dan mencegah dari yang munkar mereka itulah orang orang yang memperoleh kemenangan dan janganlah kamu seperti orang yang bercerai berai dan berselisih paham sesudah datang kepadanya bukti bukti yang terang mereka itulah orang orang yang tersedia baginya adzab yang dahsyat
1846589 pada hari wajah wajah menjadi putih berseri dan wajah wajah lain hitam muram adapun orang orang yang wajahnya menjadi hitam kepada mereka dikatakan apakah kamu menjadi kafir sesudah beriman maka rasakanlah olehmu adzab akibat kekafiranmu adapun orang orang yang wajahnya menjadi putih berseri mereka itu berada dalam rahmat allah mereka tinggal didalamnya kekal selama lamanya
1846590 setan memberi mereka janji janji dan membangkitkan keinginan keinginan kepada mereka pdahal yang dijanjikan setan setan itu tak lain hanyalah tipu muslihat belaka
1846591 para pengikut hawa nafsu pembuat bidah dan pelaku kesesatan di kalangan ummat ini
1846592 ya aisyah ketahuilah bahwa pada setiap dosa itu tersedia taubat kecuali bagi mereka yang memperturutkan hawa nafsu dan pembuat bidah untuk mereka itu tidak tersedia taubat dan aku berlepas diri dari apa yang mereka lakukan dan mereka pun berlepas tangan pula dariku
1846593 temui mereka berdua tidak seharusnya mereka berdua berpisah satu sama lain
1846594 sesungguhnya para pelaku dosa besar yang mengabaikan kewajiban kewajiban agama menurut pandangan kami tidaklah bisa disebut mukmin dan muslim tetapi munafik dan kafir atau kafir dan munafik sekaligus ia terbebas dari syirik dan dari iman karena teracuni oleh kekafiran kemunafikan dan kemaksiatan
1846595 mereka berada dalam keadaan ragu antara demikian itu iman dan kafir
1846596 tidaklah mereka itu termasuk golonganmu dan tidak pula termasuk golongan mereka
1846597 dan mereka bersumpah dengan nama allah bahwa sesungguhnya mereka termasuk golonganmu padahal mereka bukanlah dari golonganmu akan tetapi mereka adalah orang orang yang sangat takut kepadamu
1846598 maka apakah orang yang beriman itu seperti orang yang fasik
1846599 ada empat hal yang bila seluruhnya atau salah satu diantara yang empat itu berada dalam diri seseorang maka ia menjadi seorang munafik sekalipun ia shalat dan puasa serta menganggap dirinya muslim yakni bila berkata ia bohong bila diberi amanat ia khianat bila berjanji ia ingkar dan bila bermusuhan ia curang
1846600 maukah anda sekalian aku beritahu tentang perbuatan yang berada di antara mukmin dan munafik
1846601 maka jika mereka beriman kepada apa yang telah mendapat petunjuk
1846602 sesungguhnya orang orang mukmin adalah bersaudara karena itu damaikanlah antara kedua saudaramu
1846603 iman ialah hendaknya engkau mengimani allah para malaikatnya kitab kitabnya dan rasul rasul nya
1846604 sesungguhnya orang orang mukmin itu adalah mereka yang apabila disebut nama allah bergetarlah hati mereka
1846605 bukankah anda pun berpendapat bahwa orang yang selama hidupnya hanya menjahit selembar baju tidak dikatakan sebagai penjahit tetapi disebut sebagai
1846606 tidak akan berzina seseorang yang pelaku zina sepanjang dia mukmin tidak akan mencuri seorang pencuri sepanjang ia mukmin dan tidak akan minum khamr seorang peminum khamr sepanjang ia mukmin
1846607 tidaklah disebut sebagai seorang mukmin seseorang yang tidur dengan perut kenyang sedangkan tetangganya kelaparan
1846608 wahai orang orang yang mengaku beriman dengan mulutnya tetapi iman di hatinya tidak murni
1846609 sesungguhnya allah tidak akan mengampuni dosa orang yang musyrik kepada nya dan mengampuni yang selain itu kepada siapa saja yang dikehendaki nya
1846610 barang siapa yang mengharap orang yang berputus asa dari allah untuk masuk surga maka allah akan mempertemukan mereka berdua di dalam neraka
1846611 islam sebagai suatu akidah memang belum lenyap kecuali kehilangan sedikit kekuatan dan kekuasaannya tetapi sebagai kekuatan yang menguasai kehidupan social ia telah kehilangan posisinya buku h a r gibb ini dipublikasikan pada tahun 1932
1846612 serulah mereka ke jalan tuhanmu dengan cara yang bijaksana dan nasehat yang baik dan debatlah mereka dengan cara yang baik pula
1846613 tidak menaruh kepercayaan terhadap orang yang ditaklidinya sementara taklid itu sendiri berarti mengabaikan fungsi akal karena akal diciptakan untuk berfikir dan merenung sungguh buruk orang yang diberi pelita untuk menerangi jalan tetapi justru pelita itu dimatikan sementara dia rela berjalan dalam kegelapan
1846614 tiap tiap orang boleh diambil perkataannya dan boleh ditinggalkan kecuali
1846615 pendapatku benar tetapi mungkin juga mengandung kekeliruan dan pendapat orang lain salah tetapi mungkin mengandung kebenaran
1846616 yang mendengarkan perkataan lalu mengikuti apa yang paling baik di antaranya mereka itulah orang orang yang telah diberi petunjuk dan mereka itulah orang orang yang mempunyai akal
1846617 tidak sempurna iman seseorang dari kalian sehingga hawa nafsunya tunduk mengikuti apa yang telah aku bawa
1846618 bidah itu lebih dicintai iblis daripada maksiat adapun maksiat bisa bertaubat darinya sementara bidah tidak bisa bertaubat darinya
1846619 ya allah engkau mengetahui hambamu ini sangat dhoif hamba taklid karena takut terseset kedalam bidah yang masih diperdebatkan oleh masyarakat hamba ampuni hamba ya allah
1846620 beli aja baca nanti kita diskusikan dengan sebelumnya buat referensi atas buku buku tersebut
1846621 pak ada buku membuka kedok yusuf qardhawi gak atau kesesatan yusuf qhardawi
1846622 ya allah ampuni aku aku hanya ingin cross cek informasi tersebut engkau mengetahui segala isi hati hamba mu
1846623 akhi gak perlu ijin ke ana allah akan menunjuki siapa saja yang dia kehendaki ana bukan siapa siapa yang harus disakralkan dan dipatuhi ucapannya kalau itu baik menurut antum lakukan saja ana terbuka banget untuk kalo antum bingung dan ingin sharing masalah antum
1846624 dan mereka semuanya di padang mahsyar akan berkumpul menghadap ke hadirat lalu berkatalah orang orang yang lemah kepada orang orang yang sombong
1846625 seandainya memberi petunjuk kepada kami niscaya kami dapat memberi petunjuk kepadamu sama saja bagi kita apakah kita mengeluh ataukah bersabar sekali kali kita tidak mempunyai tempat untuk melarikan diri
1846626 dan ingatlah ketika mereka berbantah bantah dalam neraka maka orang orang yang lemah berkata kepada orang orang yang menyombongkan diri
1846627 dan jika kamu takut tidak akan dapat berlaku adil terhadap hak hak perempuan yatim bilamana kamu mengawininya maka kawinilah wanita wanita lain yang kamu senangi dua tiga atau empat
1846628 serulah manusia kepada jalan tuhanmu dengan hikmah dan pelajaran yang baik dan bantahlah mereka dengan cara yang baik
1846629 dan tidak ada seorang pun akan beriman kecuali dengan izin
1846630 sehingga kita menjadi salah satu dari manusia yang dinyatakan dalam ayat dan ada pula orang orang lain yang ditangguhkan sampai ada keputusan allah adakalanya allah akan mengazab mereka dan adakalanya allah akan menerima tobat mereka dan allah maha mengetahui lagi maha bijaksana
1846631 maka mengapa kamu terpecah menjadi dua golongan dalam menghadapi orang orang munafik padahal
1846632 hai orang orang yang beriman jagalah dirimu tiadalah orang yang sesat itu akan memberi mudarat kepadamu apabila kamu telah mendapat petunjuk hanya kepada
1846633 dan kamu akan melihat matahari ketika terbit condong dari gua mereka ke sebelah kanan dan bila matahari itu terbenam menjauhi mereka ke sebelah kiri sedang mereka berada dalam tempat yang luas dalam gua itu itu adalah sebagian dari tanda tanda kebesaran

1846664 we picked up the language in the classroom in the playgrounds
1846665 the variety of expressions is mind blowing and the girls are no better than the boys
1846666 i was 30 when the war started then i had no idea what mass grave meant but theyve incorporated it into their language its part of their culture
1846667 if i get hold of you amor masovic wont be able to recognise you
1846668 it just begins to scratch the surface of the bosnian catastrophe
1846669 lots of families have someone whose bones were never found i went to a psychologist to ask what i could do about my anxiety attacks i see pictures in my head of the war the bloody bodies she said i would just have to live with it
1846670 my ma was shocked by the rudeness of it and said she couldnt feel her legs after but what most shocked her was how close to her experience of the classroom it was
1846671 we can live in harmony without agreeing on underlying values
1846672 amd approach is very similar to what it has done in the past
1846673 i dont see a major departure for any of these companies in their approach however i do think it signals a change in the industry and with large and highly capable graphics processing technology coming out in the near future these companies are jostling to get developers to back their platforms
1846674 since the commuter rail bombings in madrid on mar 11 2004 and the bus bombings in london on july 7 2005 the tsa has placed a greater emphasis on the safety and security of commuter surface transportation

1846677 her staying positive in that situation was a real lifeline for all of us
1846678 she was completely straightforward about how she lived her life the things she believed
1846679 no one that age that ive known has that confidence and independence
1846680 i truly admired her she was a lot better prepared for this trip than i was
1846681 she got right in there with the people she wanted to be hands on to really experience life
1846682 i think she was finding a lot of things out about herself in nepal
1846683 she felt at home she really loved where she was

1846687 the price to fly to her was upwards of a 1000 for her and shes coming from washington state
1846688 i was coming from atlanta and we were only about a hundred dollars difference in price
1846689 you have to understand we dont make a profit on the fees we charge to the airlines
1846690 its only the money absolutely necessary to operate the facility were looking at ways to be as efficient as possible
1846691 our airline costs are less than seven dollars per passenger
1846692 the discount is usually much greater than seven dollars so even the airport offered zero costs to the airlines and they passed 100 of that onto their tickets the difference would be seven dollars
1846693 edwards is no longer an elected official and he is not running for office now dont expect wall to wall coverage
1846694 of course i mean for a lot of americans including the family that i grew up with i mean its fundamental to how you judge people and human character whether you keep your word whether you keep what is your ultimate word which is that you love your spouse and youll stay with them i think the most important qualities in a president in todays world are trustworthiness sincerity honesty strength of leadership and and certainly that goes to a part of that

1846698 its not about the terrorists its about us its about what kind of country we are
1846699 is to make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture whether it be here at home or abroad
1846700 the signing statement is saying i will only comply with this law when i want to and if something arises in the war on terrorism where i think its important to torture or engage in cruel inhuman and degrading conduct i have the authority to do so and nothing in this law is going to stop me
1846701 the cia should have the ability to use additional techniques
1846702 the practice of shipping away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries of detaining thousands without charge or trial of maintaining a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law
1846703 i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of the republicans as a partisan witch hunt because i think weve got too many problems to solve
1846704 prosecution of any officials if it were to occur would probably not occur during obamas first term
1846705 instead we may well see a congressionally empowered commission that would seek testimony from witnesses in search of the truth about what occurred though some witnesses might be offered immunity in exchange for testimony the question of whether anybody would be prosecuted would be deferred to a later date meaning obamas second term if such is forthcoming
1846706 the commission would focus strictly on detention torture and extraordinary rendition or the practice of spiriting detainees to a third country for abusive interrogations the panel would focus strictly on these abuses leaving out any other allegedly illegal activities during the bush administration such as domestic spying
1846707 relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1846708 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1846709 it is inexcusable for us taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1846710 the impression that somehow the iraqis are sitting back on these huge growing balances does not really fit what is happening
1846711 gah just come to our party its for everyone the end

1846759 this seems to suggest an effort by the police or other security forces to eavesdrop on conversations of passengers rather than for the immediate safety and security of the taxi driver
1846760 this could have been a message saying that the dears is over
1846761 hamdan is now considered a convicted war criminal and is no longer considered an enemy combatant and will be held separately from the other detainees at guantanamo because of his new status
1846762 we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1846763 this process of bringing terrorists to justice has been too long delayed but im encouraged that it is finally moving forward
1846764 unlike sen obama who voted against the military commissions act and favors giving al qaeda terrorists direct access to u s civilian courts to contest their detention i recognize that we cannot treat dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield as we would common criminals
1846765 the verdict i think was in in this case long before the jury went out to deliberate
1846766 that is that the military commission system at guantanamo bay is deeply flawed that mr hamdan could not and did not receive a fair trial

1846774 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
1846775 the law of contradiction therefore as we know it is but the expression on a created level of the internal coherence of gods nature

1846787 weve got 230 people who depend on this company for their mortgages and for their rent
1846788 the question is is the jurys verdict going to keep it from operating in the future
1846789 you know youre the greatest president this countrys ever had
1846790 anyone can learn how to touch a man and if you start off knowing some basic principles you can just follow his cues on how to turn his whole body into an erogenous zone
1846791 mens skin tends to be thicker plus their nerve endings arent as close to the skins surface as womens are so what might seem overly aggressive to you probably feels just right to him
1846792 guys are always so protective of their whole groin area like during sports for example i always thought of it as a really delicate spot but one night i was touching dan and he told me i could grip a little tighter so i kept increasing the pressure until my fingers were locked around him even though i was afraid i was hurting him he says that it feels incredible
1846793 dont be afraid to go beyond using your fingertips the penis shaft is usually more responsive to an encompassing full hand hold
1846794 if one area gets too much stimulation you become desensitized to the feeling
1846795 when hes responding fully his skin will jump or the muscles will quiver slightly under your touch
1846796 if hes completely still thats your cue to move on for a few minutes before touching that place again
1846797 of course clay loves for me to give him a hand job but i found out that i can drive his excitement level way higher if i switch spots ill touch his penis enough for him to get worked up then ill stop that and start tracing my fingers down his stomach or up his lower legs he says that when i finally get back to ground zero after my detour hes twice as sensitive to my touch and twice as turned on
1846798 using each hand in a different place gives him an exciting tantalizing feeling
1846799 besides the simple fact that youre stimulating more nerve endings the separate sensations also create twice the anticipation
1846800 whenever i give john oral sex i touch him in different places around his body as well i keep one hand either around his penis or touching his twins and i use my other hand to scratch his inner thighs or stroke his butt he says it feels like hes with two women at once
1846801 the spleen meridian has erotic qualities touching that area increases energy flow to the reproductive organs
1846802 its infinitely more exciting for a man to be touched if hes touching his partner simultaneously
1846803 for many men just caressing your breasts is a turn on unto itself
1846804 whenever i tried to make jason lie back while i took control of pleasing him hed start squirming after two minutes then roll over and grab me finally i realized that if i straddled him and let him run his hands over my breasts and butt while i worked on him hed be happy to lie there forever
1846805 first completely stop touching him for 30 seconds or so
1846806 thats enough time for most men to lose the sense of urgency that theyre about to climax
1846807 when andy is getting close to climaxing i tease him by taking each stroke halfway up the shaft but when he gets to the point where he cant take it anymore i zone in on the ridge of his penis he says that his climaxes are totally explosive
1846808 oh thats what will make me happy not doing drugs i should have thought of that myself thank you very special episode
1846809 so tell me where have you been im getting older and i need something to beleive in
1846810 example shut up you spend your whole life on myspace or telling everyone about your life on myspace stop trying to get people to download your music we all know thats just so you can get more profile views which clearly means a lot to you youd actually have to pay me to listen to your music you summed yourself up in your first song you cant rap cos youre white and from fulham a shitty football team who somehow manage to realise at the end of each season that maybe they should concentrate on staying up

1846857 i literally just apologized to cooper for not being able to get into the fifth or sixth inning that was all that was said
1846858 really thats all there was to it like i said its just an unfortunate day for me and an unfortunate day for us as the astros tim byrdak really gets a big thumbs up for what he did
1846859 thats hard to leave him in longer after the second inning we just said we need you to stay in as long as you can go he did the best he could under the circumstances
1846860 close pitches just missed and put me in a bad situation to ultimately give up the big hit after that the walks got me to the situation where i couldnt make a mistake and i did
1846861 i got to 100 pitches and obviously things werent working for me and i got to another bases loaded jam
1846862 of course i would have loved to have said i was going to get a groundball double play and get out of the inning and possibly start the next inning but it was time
1846863 we cant pitch geary and chris sampson just pitched yesterday
1846864 we needed to get as many as we could out of backe we were hoping to get five or six we didnt get that so we had to stretch out byrdak as far as we could

1846890 the report published in the nejm also found that electronic health records were used by 51 percent of larger practices with 50 or more doctors
1846891 indeed electronic health records are pervasive in the largest integrated medical groups like kaiser permanente the mayo clinic the cleveland clinic university of pittsburgh medical center and others these integrated groups not only have deep pockets by combining doctors clinics hospitals and often some insurance they can also capture the financial savings from electronic health records
1846892 in the e mail justen deal a project supervisor who has worked for the company for two years detailed his frustration with kaisers electronic health record system which he considers inefficient and unreliable
1846893 dr masucci was already using athenahealths outsourced financial service and less than two years ago adopted the online medical record
1846894 do i see more patients because of this technology probably no
1846895 but i am doing a better job with the patients i am seeing it almost forces you to be a better doctor
1846896 everyone was having a good time lindsay and sam were very comfortable with the group around you can tell theyre so in love lindsay seemed to really fit in it seemed like everyone really likes her
1846897 probably only a handful of the audience of watchmen will see the extent of the detail that we have lovingly copied into this set from the brownstone house and underground chamber that we saw that day but it is all there and it makes me happy
1846898 but if we dont see fewer patients during the conversion from paper to computer we dont get paid
1846899 we have a broken market for electronic health record adoption because the people who gain financially are not the people who pay
1846900 to fix the market dr middleton recommends that the government play a role in providing incentives or subsidies to speed the use of computerized patient records in the united states
1846901 the government took a step in that direction last week announcing a 150 million
1846902 one in five of the nations 43 million medicare enrollees are now in the medicare advantage program which the bush administration says has brought more choices and better benefits to the federal health system
1846903 medicare advantage has become a political target because whatever its vaunted enhancements it costs the federal government 12 percent more for each enrollee on average than the regular medicare system
1846904 the congressional critics see the policies as an extravagance whose main beneficiaries are insurers like humana and unitedhealth
1846905 under medicare advantage the insurer provides coverage through a network of doctors and the government pays the insurer a flat annual fee per enrollee that federal payment varies from county to county but it averages about 9 000 per enrollee nationwide
1846906 unitedhealth in contrast will get about 15 percent of this years projected pretax profit of 7 48 billion from medicare
1846907 and humana is transforming itself into a big time government contractor it will get almost three fourths of its projected 1 28 billion in pretax profit this year from medicare mainly from the medicare advantage program according to analysts
1846908 with the white house ideologically committed to protecting ma the
1846909 as the juggernaut for medicare privatization the pffs plans have been staunchly supported by the bush administration despite per beneficiary costs that are an estimated 17 percent higher than those of traditional medicare
1846910 and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work
1846911 i could sell them the characters from superbad something but i think wed want some action so you know somehow the kids get in trouble somehow and we have to get them out of it and seth plays characters in both movies so somehow wed have to kill one of them off
1846912 leaders of the energy amp commerce committee introduced h r 6357 this week and the health subcommittee approved it on june 26 the full committee as well as two other house committees now will consider the bill
1846913 the legislation lacks provisions to enable patients to review their own files and make corrections decide who has access to personal health information or simply opt out according to aclu
1846914 if this legislation gets approved americans medical secrets will be extremely vulnerable to being lost stolen or sold to the highest bidder
1846915 absolutely not are you crazy there are going to be kids in that camp from the toughest neighborhoods in new york city you will never live to go to medical school
1846916 online were all black and white and 10 points tall
1846917 dr bhupinder singh 42 a general internist in new york sold his practice and went to work part time at a hospital in queens when he decided to work in a hospital he figured that there would be more freedom to practice his specialty
1846918 ninety percent of doctors i know are fed up with medicine
1846919 it is not just managed care stories of patients armed with medical knowledge gleaned from the internet demanding
1846920 doctors are working harder and faster to maintain income even as staff salaries and costs of living continue to increase some have resorted to selling herbs and vitamins retail out of their offices to make up for decreasing revenue others are limiting their practices just to patients who can pay out of pocket
1846921 there are serious consequences to this discontent the most worrisome of which is that it is difficult for doctors who are so unhappy to provide good care
1846922 another is a looming shortage of doctors especially in primary care which has the lowest reimbursement of all the medical specialties and probably has the most dissatisfied practitioners
1846923 for me its an endless amount of work that i can never get through to do it properly
1846924 im a bit compulsive there is no time to do it all in a day
1846925 the upshot is that the doctor who knows a patient best is often uninvolved in her care when she is hospitalized this contributes to the poor coordination and wanton consultation that is so common in hospitals today
1846926 now youve got so many people coming in its hard to know whos who
1846927 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things
1846928 for this peoples heart has become calloused they hardly hear with their ears and they have closed their eyes otherwise they might see with their eyes hear with their ears understand with their hearts and turn and i would heal them
1846929 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them

1846934 churches that see themselves as a centered set recognize that the gospel is so precious so refreshing that like a well in the australian outback lovers of christ will not stray too far from it it is then a truly christ centered model rather than seeing people as christian or non christian as in or out we would see people by their degree of distance from the center christ in this way the missional incarnational church sees people as christian and not yet christian it acknowledges the contribution of all people

1846940 the kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field
1846941 the owners servants came to him and said sir didnt you sow good seed in your field where then did the weeds come from
1846942 the servants asked him do you want us to go and pull them up
1846943 no he answered because while you are pulling the weeds you may root up the wheat with them
1846944 then he left the crowd and went into the house
1846945 explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field
1846946 the one who sowed the good seed is the son of man

1846962 one of the hotels former regulars farmer bruce mckellar 71 said he would miss his corner of the bar i would walk in and straight to it we all had our own space he said
1846963 jesus said go into all the world and this includes pubs he didnt say sit in your church and wait for people to come to you
1846964 initially many wont accept you talking about jesus maybe after youve listened to them ten or twenty times which can be exausting they might say can you pray for me and then you see things happen
1846965 yes were selling booze to people who could do without it but if we dont theyll just go somewhere else at least if theyre here we can get alongside them i knew that when i came here i personally had to be seen not to drink but im not everybody someone once showed me proverbs 31 which says beer and wine are only for the dying or for those who have lost all hope let them drink and forget how poor and miserable they feel but you must defend those who are helpless and have no hope so i have to ask what would jesus have done i think the lord would have been here in the pubs

1846992 tell the truth be real encourage everyone to tell their story stop telling us there is only one story yes there is only one story about jesus but there are millions of stories that we have to tell about finding him give up power and control stop editing out the mistakes flaws and imperfections let others see that the church is not full of dazzling people but rather ordinary people with dazzling stories about jesus

1846997 in his poem the investment robert frost sketches a quaint scene of people trying to escape the reality of the hardscrabble life of potato farming
1846998 out in the fields a farmer freezing as he digs in the cold soil hears the music and looks back to the brightly colored home
1846999 the metaphor of an old couple surrounded by desolate potato fields splashing their home with color and filling their parlor with music is a powerful one
1847000 but on the other hand the metaphor works as a symbol of what the church might become as robert frost says of the farmer in the field
1847001 the farmers chief concern is survival hes counting winter dinners while giving half an ear to the enthusiastic playing in the midst of the cold brown plots a house full of color and music that rages against the prevailing culture of sandness and uncertainty is just what the church should be
1847002 we recently saw the covor of a book about reinventing the church thats an icon of just what we think is wrong with the post christendom church
1847003 all the tinkering with the existing model of church thats going on will not save the day simply making minor adjustments like replacing pews with more comfortable seating or singing contemporary pop songs instead of hymns will not reverse the fundamental decline in the fortunes of the western chruch if you think of the church as a car we cannot simply take it in for service we need a whole new model or think of a chruch as a vcr if you have newer dvds you cant play them on your old vcr you need an entirely different device

1847043 the pope is still the pope and yet this is the worst crisis the church has ever endured in part because the conciliar popes helped along by the blind obedience of the neo catholics have refused to acknowledge that there is a crisis but instead persist in the very novelties that have engendered it
1847044 we are right and hold to the true catholic faith while you folks progressives and liberals cf p 17 masking yourselves as orthodox are mere pretenders
1847045 we have a magisterium the neo catholic says that provides catholics with a unique source of stability and constancy agreed but with what precisely is the magisterium concerned to this question neo catholics are unwilling to offer a clear answer since the neo catholic will brook no criticism of any major ecclesial fad that has the support of the vatican the neo catholic version of the magisterium seems a quite expansive thing indeed
1847046 that theological surprises are alien to the perennial catholic magisterium poses no difficulty for the neo catholic mentality
1847047 we will nevertheless undertake a further demonstration of what is obvious to everyone but neo catholics

1847051 a study of episcopal consecrations against the will of the pope applied to the consecration of 30th june 1988 by archbishop marcel lefebvre
1847052 all these declarations from tradition are so emphatic that we must conclude from them that a man who has been declared schismatic by the roman pontiff must cease absolutely to claim the name of catholic
1847053 the time for a frank and efficacious collaboration has not arrived yet
1847054 with a paternal heart but with all the gravity required by the current circumstances i urge you revered brother not to embark upon a course which if persisted in cannot but appear as a schismatic act whose inevitable theological and canonical consequences are well known to you i earnestly invite you to return in humility to full obedience to the vicar of christ
1847055 thus i beg and urge you in the name of jesus christ to consider with great attention to what you are about to accomplish against the laws of the holy discipline as well as to the most serious consequences concerning communion with the catholic church of which you are bishop
1847056 monsignor marcel lefebvre archbishop bishop emeritus of tulle notwithstanding the formal canonical warning of 17 june last and the repeated appeals to desist from his intention has performed a schismatical act by the episcopal consecration of four priests without pontifical mandate and contrary to the will of the supreme pontiff and has therefore incurred the penalty envisaged by canon 1364 paragraph 1 and canon 1382 of the code of canon law having taken account of all the juridical effects i declare that the above mentioned archbishop marcel lefebvre and bernard fellay bernard tissier de mallerais richard williamson and alfonso de galarreta have incurred ipso facto excommunication latae sententiae reserved to the apostolic see moreover i declare that monsignor antonio de castro mayer bishop emeritus of campos since he took part directly in the liturgical celebration as co consecrator and adhered publicly to the schismatical act has incurred excommunication latae sententiae as envisaged by canon 1364 1 the priests and faithful are warned not to support the schism of archbishop lefebvre otherwise they shall incur ipso facto the very grave penalty of excommunication
1847057 another church or ecclesial community in the meaning used in the ecumenical directory
1847058 no heretic or schismatic in the course of history has declared himself to be wrong they have always thought that the church was wrong

1847060 now comes the cardinal in his letter of april 5 one month ago with a fivefold rebuke
1847061 the time of a frank collaboration has not yet come
1847062 the faithful once deprived of their ministry would espouse the cause of the heretics
1847063 not to be in full communion with the catholic church
1847064 on the excommunication for schism incurred by the adherents of the movement of archbishop lefebvre
1847065 our faithful that is catholics who regularly attend our masses should firmly and positively be told that they do not have the right to attend indult masses even if they have no other way of satisfying their sunday obligation
1847066 on july 3 1991 mrs patricia morley had recourse to this congregation against the decree of the bishop of honolulu issued on may 1 1991 his excellency the most reverend joseph anthony ferrario with aforesaid decree declared mrs morley excommunicated on the grounds that she had committed the crime of schism and thus had incurred the latae sententiae penalty as provided for in canon 1364 1 of the code of canon law this congregation has examined carefully all the available documentation and has ascertained that the activities engaged in by the petitioner though blameworthy on various accounts are not sufficient to constitute the crime of schism since mrs morley did not in fact commit the crime of schism and thus did not incur the latae sententiae penalty it is clear that the decree of the bishop lacks the precondition on which it is founded this congregation noting all of the above is obliged to declare null and void the aforesaid decree of the ordinary of honolulu

1847070 i read your blog you weirdo i cant believe you said all of that stuff and wrote that freaky poem
1847071 honestly five years ago i was in a relationship with someone who was a little older than me who kept saying lets go graziano my clock is ticking
1847072 when he came he brought more blessings to me i think
1847073 it feels like my careers getting better since he came
1847074 im not writing as dark as i was before im not writing stuff like the wiggles or stuff you would hear on noggin but im definitely writing not as dark
1847075 now seriously i get the guitar and i play in front of him and he smiles and i write something up and its like oh my god and i didnt even have to get messed up for that i did it from him smiling ive never gotten inspiration like that
1847076 for me because its a matter of time the only thing im starting to do now is whatever im doing musically its just to write the very best that i can and then leave it alone and work to the next thing because theres only so much time i dont have anymore
1847077 i dont have that much time so when i do i want to make sure the quality is there and really love what im doing and not waste my time doing what i dont love doing
1847078 especially coming home from a gig at 3 4 in the morning and youre like oh my god the babys going to be up in two hours
1847079 i cant imagine at times like this when i see him smile when i see him laugh and when he gives his mumbo jumbo at me i cant imagine being away from that for more than a week
1847080 i was so nervous he wasnt going to remember me when i got back
1847081 personally i think i am conventional and this is whats starting to be conventional
1847082 all these people say you cant be a musician because youre a father now you have to give up certain things it doesnt have to be that way
1847083 i think a lot of people that say live in new hartford and whitesboro and these rural places around here being a parent you know they dont know what its like in west utica on a wednesday night when you have to go out and play in front of people in a restaurant or at a bar
1847084 theres life going on its an experience i just like it down there a little bit on that level its not for money breads always good but i like being a musician because i get to see some pretty crazy people in the city that otherwise would be forgotten by to people who have a car payment and cable

1847088 as voters steam over gas prices republican congressional candidates are bracing for a gusher of ads from now until election day attacking their ties to oil companies
1847089 at a time when were facing 4 gasoline i think that you need people whove been in the energy industry to tell us what to do
1847090 udall a five term congressman repeatedly attacked schaffer on his energy stance calling the former congressman an oil executive who likes to see high gas prices
1847091 theres a clear contrast here im clearly somebody whos going to work across the board to drive down gas prices congressman schaffer talks about the situation were in but he doesnt acknowledge that he played a key roll in getting us in this situation
1847092 udall a five term congressman repeatedly attacked schaffer on his energy stance calling the former congressman an oil executive who likes to see high gas prices
1847093 theres a clear contrast here im clearly somebody whos going to work across the board to drive down gas prices congressman schaffer talks about the situation were in but he doesnt acknowledge that he played a key roll in getting us in this situation

1847095 the child just snapped went to the kitchen and grabbed a butcher knife and started to kill his whole family
1847096 greyhound knows how important it is to get these removed and we are doing everything possible
1847097 this is something that we immediately asked to be done last week realizing that these could be offensive
1847098 is that the pope who commits scandal concerning the faith remains the pope though he may be rebuked and corrected
1847099 nowhere does bellarmine teach that kings or councils much less isolated members of the church can judge a pope guilty of heresy
1847100 overturn all the rites of the church founded on apostolic tradition
1847101 if the pope gives an order contrary to right customs he should not be obeyed if he attempts to do something manifestly opposed to justice and the common good it will be lawful to resist him
1847102 si enim aliquid statuat contra bonos mores non erit illi parendum
1847103 who has beforehand deviated from the catholic faith or fallen into any heresy
1847104 are reasonably well informed about the faith however refutation is a simple matter
1847105 and on that score the pontificates of men like alexander vi barely enter into the competition in light of the misdeeds of the current regime
1847106 i personally am still inclined to believe that the pope is an honest slave of enlightenment rhetoric and its corollaries rather than its sinister master
1847107 but again such concepts are torturously foggy and pseudo mystical rather than refreshingly limpid in their heretical connotations
1847108 ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of the truth
1847109 in late 2001 the pontifical biblical commission released a book entitled
1847110 the jews are perfectly entitled to live as if christ had never come
1847111 now for someone who is willing to overlook crucial distinctions and leap to unwarranted conclusions about the present crisis it would be easy to say with the sedevacantists that all of these novelties and apparent contradictions of past teaching are heresy but a careful examination of these novelties and apparent contradictions one by one shows that none of them involves the formal denial of an article of divine and catholic faith recent statement may st john the baptist protect islam is heresy properly speaking since the popes public expression of a wish that a false religion receive divine protection while certainly scandalous and even stupefying does not translate into a direct denial of any article of divine and catholic faith
1847112 then your false faith is truly not christian as it doesnt even require you to believe that jesus is necessary for salvation you catholics are truly christ deniers just as i believed all along
1847113 by this i do not mean to suggest that neo catholics like johnston are subjectively heretical in intention but rather that their extreme defense of novelty in the church leads to a grave objective error against faith

1847155 she is very appreciative of the continued commitment of her supporters and understands there are passionate feelings around the convention while no decisions have been made at this time they will be made collaboratively with sen clinton and her staff the dnc and sen obamas campaign and released at the appropriate time
1847156 its a reflection of genuine frustration by hillary clinton supporters that sen obama seems to have forgotten about 18 million voters
1847157 my concern about sen obama is he doesnt recognize that the outreach to the clinton grass roots has to be more visible more overt as well as more symbolic

1847192 but in our main warehouse things have slowed up also and they are our main resource so when theyre slow that means were slow

1847196 i know how these stories develop having written more than a few of them myself over the last 20 years you start with one fact get the usual suspects to speculate on what that fact could mean throw those speculations into print then look for an official denial of the parts that are wrong once that denial comes through we rinse and repeat with the goal of eventually converging on something close to the truth its not a very elegant way to do journalism but thats the way it happens in the tech trades which now include everything from blogs to the new york times
1847197 im dead that sucks at least for me and my family and friends
1847198 but all the tears in the world arent going to bring me back so i would prefer that people remember the good things about me rather than mourning my loss

1847212 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury

1847256 this guy is just speaking out very effectively for the palestinian cause thats what is the root of this and the government is trying to stifle that

1847270 john 12 42 as you can see fear of audibly confessing christ does not prevent a person from getting saved salvation is of the heart not the mouth so whether a person prays a sinners pray or not is irrelevant to their salvation what matters is what is going on in the heart

1847327 these analyses lay to rest the idea that letting hen harrier numbers increase at langholm meant that other species like curlew lapwing and golden plover were wiped out on the contrary populations of some of these species actually rose
1847328 this is a fascinating analysis of predators and prey which illustrates how hen harrier numbers may limit the abundance of their principal prey the meadow pipit the authors rightly note too that while raptors did not appear to reduce numbers of breeding waders any loss of grouse management in the uplands could
1847329 this robust science building on the other important scientific work on langholm in the 1990s provides solid evidence that harriers were not implicated in changes in number of waders at langholm then it is important that this sort of monitoring continues within the new langholm moor demonstration project where the evidence base founded on observation and detailed analysis is so important

1847357 weve taken the first of what must be three steps to make the caps permanent and constitutional the legislature has voted once to submit this to a referendum of the people a second vote under our law must occur and then you the people get a chance to vote

1847378 neuropathy is a chronic and significant problem in hiv patients as there are few existing treatments that offer adequate pain management to sufferers
1847379 we found that smoked cannabis was generally well tolerated and effective when added to the patients existing pain medication resulting in increased pain relief

1847381 you gonna just stand there or do i get a proper hullo
1847382 i never once said it was alright for you to wipe my mind doctor you bloody little alien git i almost had it in my mind to take the tardis out for a spin while you wandered my city honestly doctor what if i hadnt been okay what if youd come back and nothing had changed and you caused my death now what the dickens makes you okay with that
1847383 i could only hope that you would rediscover yourself i never wanted to leave you behind but i couldnt risk being the cause of your death
1847384 you seemed to like the language as you just spoke to me in it so i figured id do you a favour and return the favour
1847385 what was that are you trying to figure out how im me again cause you should already know that im not going to tell you spaceboy
1847386 donna the doctor and donna sounds fitting dont you think
1847387 more like the doctor donna if you ask me the doctors donna doctor donna and her little doctor spaceboy and earthgirl as different as we are weve both got a little bit of the same thing inside us

1847389 well youve already shown me the nestene conciousness and i do remember dabbling in pompeii but a trip to gallifrey just doesnt seem right at the moment

1847398 i reached out to 30 companies in portland 30 in seattle and 30 in idaho i answered the first one in portland and flew out to meet with them i didnt really have the experience but they were interested in me because they were impressed that i took such lengths to get the job they hired me on the spot
1847399 my friend wanted to go the mortgage broker route and i wanted to do the real estate part so it was the perfect partnership we accumulated properties while the banks would give us money but stopped once the debt started mounting probably a good thing but it wasnt like i woke up one day and decided i wanted to be a green real estate agent
1847400 i was getting my license at the time decided i wanted to leave my job and do this full time
1847401 how does not studying for the test help you leave home any sooner
1847402 doesnt living in a more healthy efficient and sustainable home make sense
1847403 ive found that there are as many shades of education with no standards as there are shades of green
1847404 whoever it is in the room that has the most information wins you have to embrace technology if you want to be successful in this business many agents that arent embracing this technology are seeing a decline in their business if your customers are tech savvy then shouldnt you be
1847405 will help me bridge the gap between builders developers and consumers many agents out there today cant inform their clients on the benefits of green and dont know much about the value economic or environmental of the materials used
1847406 everyone would like to be in a position to not to have to work i make less doing this than what i did at amazon this was a quality of life thing i didnt want to be attached to a pager in the boiler room of an it department there are a million ways to make money at the end of the day you have to choose how to do it im making a living doing something that at the end of the day i can feel good about my clients are in a better situation that when they started im doing my bit to contribute to a healthy lifestyle and planet for others i want to see change happen rather than just fuss about it
1847407 i consider myself an environmentalist but a different shade than the type that burnt the street of dreams homes in issaquah granted the homes where excessive in size but think of how many similar homes are built that arent green at least the builders reduced the impact of those houses now those homes will be rebuilt and have twice the ecological cost people have to realize that for environmentalism to succeed there must be a profitable way to do it or society as a whole will never accept it they raised awareness to their cause than the cause
1847408 in this business sales are down and that can be the difference of having food on the table for some this is one reason i want to begin to consult on the side its pretty hectic but im laid back by nature it wouldnt be healthy or worth it if you couldnt create any balance when you are on your own there is always something to do
1847409 one of the things about being a small business owner is that you have to live your normal life its only you and its all about being efficient
1847410 most realtors today dont have training in green building if green buyers and green builders knew that they would want their realtor to know more about the benefits of green building specializing in this field i can communicate this better to the public better than a typical agent would
1847411 i encourage a lot of builders that specialize in green or have green programs to get out and network get their names out there develop partnerships communities like biznik have been great for that
1847412 if you really want to do a small business you have to just make the jump you cant dip your toes you have to jump off the dock for those without a second income partner or ability to make rent doing this right away it will just take longer and you might have to keep your day job nothing is easy

1847419 it does cross the freeway and would connect central city west to downtown
1847420 why not use it i walked in the tunnel about a year ago to take a look at it
1847421 we feel there is a potential for re use it would be pretty inexpensive to re open it given that a new tunnel costs about 75 million a mile to build
1847422 it could run smaller buses or even full size buses that go one way downtown in the a m and reverse in the p m
1847423 we have no plans for the tunnel the question is how you get reconnected back to the surface from where the tunnel is blocked at the bonaventure also there are safety question new earthquake standards

1847559 i always see situations where there is suddenly no income with children to take care of and you just watch the victims fall to pieces
1847560 unfortunately this is happens all the time when people become disabled
1847561 there isnt as strong of a safety net for injuries or disabilities as many may think
1847562 there arent any that will suddenly step in and start paying you 1 000 a month
1847563 interestingly there are a number of churches in particular that believe in working with inmates when people leave prison
1847564 obviously i applaud that but it would be really good to find something similar to help victims and get them on their feet too
1847565 people ask me my plans all the time and you know what im just going day to day i dont know or care what tomorrow holds for me
1847566 hopefully i have enough gas to go where i need to go and can come home without a bill collector waiting for me thats it
1847567 it is not inconceivable that rates could be either raised or less likely cut
1847568 the three way split in the mpcs voting in july encapsulates the predicament that the bank is in over a deepening and widening economic slowdown yet elevated and still rising inflation
1847569 hell i guarantee the content co opters at abel to yzerman were about to link this article under the heading
1847570 i realize its the slow summer season but can this guy tone down the tough guy histrionics his posts are fatiguing on an otherwise excellent site
1847571 i constantly marvel at how bill iwocpo and his disciples at abel to yzerman can be so pompous and full of themselves throughout every regular season but come playoff time they collapse into wavering puddles of stress and nervousness as they anxiously await the impending and unavoidable collapse of the red wings in the post season
1847572 its just a shame that the most classless uneducated lowbrow fanbase in the league gets this sweep red wing fans dont deserve their team

1847577 he said he was not going to face the death penalty but instead had a plan to kill co workers and other individuals who had wronged him
1847578 bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas
1847579 we have this anthrax death to america death to israel
1847580 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
1847581 we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt
1847582 has been the sole custodian of rmr 1029 since it was first grown in 1997
1847583 the contaminant must have been introduced during the production of the post and brokaw spores
1847584 that he had incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and feared that he might not be able to control his behaviour
1847585 repeatedly named other researchers as possible mailers and claimed that the anthrax used in the attacks resembled that of another researcher
1847586 if i dont know who the e mail is from i dont open it i just delete it
1847587 the cnn one has fake e mail headers it looks like it came from cnn but the giveaway is when you see where the email come from you have to be a computer person to see it but you can see it was sent from a home computer
1847588 they want you to look at attachments so they want them to look as legitimate as possible
1847589 we have seen instances where creators will make a virus then another person will make a virus thats better and theyll have a war between them
1847590 help people who are too frail to exercise and those with health problems like diabetes that are improved with exercise
1847591 should we prevent non therapeutic mutilation and extreme body modification
1847592 it would necessitate changing ideas about when people retire and when they stop paying into the system
1847593 we havent made any decisions but that clearly is an option
1847594 there is no food and drug administration category for longevity drugs so if the company is to submit a drug for approval it needs to be for a specific disease
1847595 the significance if any for the federal criminal justice system of advances in lie detector technology
1847596 like father like son the relationships between conviction trajectories of fathers and their sons and daughters
1847597 the possibility that we clinicians may be prevented from offering sutent to our patients is an outrage
1847598 this decision will mean that the uk will have the poorest survival figures for the cancer in europe
1847599 although these treatments are clinically effective regrettably the cost to the nhs is such that they are not a cost effective use of nhs resources
1847600 if final guidance remains as it currently stands it will certainly mean an early death sentence for many

1847603 estaba muy determinado a completar con toda mi energ a la distancia me sent realmente feliz cuando toqu la pared escuch a la multitud gritar y vi los n meros m gicos aparecer en la pizarra 14 58 27 se trataba de un nuevo r cord mundial y de la primera vez que se nadaban los 1 500 metros en menos de 15 minutos
1847604 de hecho estaba tan exhausto y cansado que no pod a expresar mis sentimientos pero pude alzar mis manos en se al de victoria y apreciar que todo el complejo alrededor de 4 000 personas estaba parado y aplaudi ndome
1847605 realmente lo lament por ellos y me sent triste porque con los estadounidenses compartimos en muchos torneos internacionales que se desarrollaron en los dos a os previos a las olimpiadas ramos muy cercanos hab amos establecido v nculos de amistad
1847606 cuando me enter de la noticia me sent realmente disgustado
1847607 creo que ellos se sintieron muy mal y yo tuve esa misma sensaci n cuatro a os despu s
1847608 no la pod a aceptar como atletas sentimos que hab amos entrenado durante cuatro a os para nada y que nos hab an arrebatado el objetivo de competir en los juegos ol mpicos me sent al borde del abismo y no ve a nada que me motivara a continuar esforz ndome mi meta hab a desaparecido instant neamente
1847609 me deprim y s que muchos atletas perdieron inter s en el deporte por esa decisi n
1847610 probablemente pude haber tenido una mejor actuaci n y exhibido mis mejores resultados en esas olimpiadas para m la decisi n de continuar nadando significaba sacrificar mi vida por otros cuatro a os y no era algo sencillo en aquel momento de hecho para m fue un desastre estar en esa situaci n no le deseo a nadie experimentar eso
1847611 s lo mi familia y mis amigos m s cercanos cre an que pod a conseguir buenos resultados sent la falta de inter s de los medios de comunicaci n que no me consideraban uno de los favoritos y las miradas extra as de mis rivales que no me ve an como el fuerte
1847612 cuando estaba en la banqueta de salida evoqu todo lo que hab a logrado en nataci n y un toda mi experiencia y toda mi confianza en esa ltima competencia sab a que pod a nadar muy r pido pues estaba armado de mi habilidad para nadar de entrenamiento y de experiencia estaba convencido de que har a todo lo posible para ganar esa carrera
1847613 no debemos mezclar la pol tica con las olimpiadas pienso que la pureza del deporte debe prevalecer y que todos los atletas que han estado sacrificando sus vidas con a os de preparaci n y trabajo duro merecen que sean entendidos el esp ritu ol mpico debe dominar los juegos no otros temas
1847614 he has gone to pressure plates and command wire and that creates a problem for us and were seeing that more and more

1847623 the army proposed the change based upon some feedback they received that in a couple of cases where the court members jurors acquitted the accused of murder charges convicted instead on manslaughter charges as a lesser included offense and then were dismayed to hear that the maximum punishment possible was only 10 years
1847624 it appears that there were anecdotal reports that panel members in a number of cases i don t know how many or the specifics apparently considered the maximum punishments for manslaughter involving a child as low
1847625 the bottom line is that the amendment brought military punishments more in line with the civilian structure depending upon whether the victim was an adult or child
1847626 the logic has been that children are especially vulnerable victims and having stiff penalties provides an extra layer of protection
1847627 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1847628 a shortage of trained staff weak procurement and budgeting systems and violence and sectarian strife

1847630 in all developing countries you put objectives and sometimes you don t reach them
1847631 determined to spend this money on development they see it as a priority
1847632 i know some people in the united states say we re not at war that it s a simple law enforcement matter
1847633 well in law enforcement you respond after the crime hopefully the sept 11 2001 lesson will teach us all that it s important to prevent the crime from happening in the first place that we have a duty and that s why it s important to use all assets of national power to keep the pressure on the enemy
1847634 that ll make this alliance even stronger and more viable in the future
1847635 until we reach our ultimate goal and that is a korea that is free of nuclear weapons

1847647 i do not believe that setting arbitrary timelines for withdrawal would be wise in light of the fragile situation that exists in iraq

1847739 the church draws her life from christ in the eucharist
1847740 the eucharist as christs saving presence in the community of the faithful and its spiritual food is the most precious possession which the church can have in her journey through history
1847741 the eucharist thus appears as both the source and the summit of all evangelization since its goal is the communion of mankind with christ and in him with the father and the holy spirit 41
1847742 the eucharist precisely by building up the church creates human community

1847764 its just really about controlling stem cells is really what it comes down to
1847765 were one step closer to being able to use these cells if were one step closer to being able to control what they can become
1847766 how do you get a cell that can become over 200 different things to become one thing and not the other 199
1847767 i think what theyve done is establish a proof of principle that stem cells can be directed in a very refined way
1847768 gas station tv was considering running political ads and we have been approached by a few campaigns
1847769 we have made a conscious decision not to run political ads on our network
1847770 gas station tv informed the campaign this afternoon that the company will not run ads that are damaging to oil companies
1847771 once again the oil companies and their friends are standing with senator mccain the candidate for president who is proposing to offer them a 4 billion tax cut
1847772 it looks like gas station tv doesnt want the american people to know about senator obamas plan to offer working families a 1 000 energy rebate that would be funded by a tax on oil company profits the oil companies have taken sides in this race and they are standing with john mccain because they know hes been in washington for 26 years and can be counted on to pursue for another four years of the bush energy policy thats made them billions of dollars

1847780 we are no closer to getting married than we were years ago its like a car stalled at the side of the road
1847781 i love holly very much and i think were going to be together the rest of my life but marriage isnt part of my puzzle its not a personal thing i just havent had much luck with marriages
1847782 my goal is to be hosting my own show and be happily married with children so ive been thinking about that a lot lately
1847783 i just thought they were imagining it but there was a lot of banging and an earthy smell in the house then one night i was lying in bed and a mist came across the room
1847784 i wanted to shout out at it but i couldnt get my words out my face seemed to be paralysed it all got too much for me when that happened
1847785 you think people are exaggerating until you experience it i was home alone one evening and suddenly heard these footsteps coming up the stairs
1847786 they went into my dads bedroom and then i heard all the cupboards banging open it sounded like burglars
1847787 a lady came to cleanse the house she said a man was trapped between two worlds
1847788 just after sadie died i came home and i felt like i didnt want to go in the house
1847789 i got a missed call on my mobile but it didnt ring the call was from my own home number but there was nobody in the house then when i went inside there was a smell like cigarettes which sadie used to smoke and the smell of her perfume

1847792 it is practically certain that caste j ti did not originate from the four classes admittedly it developed later than they but this proves nothing
1847793 the compiler of the institutes of manu was well aware of the distinction between var a and j ti while he mentions about fifty different castes he lays much stress on the fact that there are only four var as the two terms are carelessly confused in one passage x 31 but in that only separate castes existed from an early date their relations to one another remain unaffected whether they are grouped theoretically under four occupational headings or not
1847794 a genuine apology is an important and necessary first step in the process of racial reconciliation

1847799 only it was spoken all over in germany poland ukraine kind of jewish lingua franca
1847800 it started along the rhine around eleventh century my thoughts went to a news item about an affair of a famous author with a younger girl apparently dug out to show clinton was not reinventing the wheel with monica he used my silence to fill the gap himself
1847801 hebrew of course was there as the language of ritual but everything else was done in yiddish in 1908 a resolution was passed that yiddish should be the language of israel
1847802 of course for theodore herzl the language could only be german
1847803 the first time i learnt of this was as a teenager an indian leader returned from a visit to israel and said if the jews can revive hebrew why cant we revive sanskrit
1847804 they also laughed when attempts were made to revive the hebrew language then came the first family in which hebrew was the mother tongue now when i hear people make baby talk in hebrew its just unbelievable
1847805 29 hebrew what has that got to do with sanskrit
1847806 once we start dealing with outstanding issues sanskrit can be taught on a larger scale
1847807 25 against the critical edition of the mah bh rata
1847808 ah yes but you know after a point the statistics dont seem to mean much one needs an actual account to bring it to life like the diary of anne frank
1847809 they came and took the gypsies they came and took the jews they came and took the ukranians and the ukranian police came and helped take them
1847810 people will be rounded up and shot my father was rounded up he had a sense of humour he said to them why are you killing us in such a small batch you will have to carry the corpses to where the large group is why not kill us there we will walk there ourselves
1847811 when the russians came in 1945 it all began in 1942 when the nazis turned on the russians and ukraine was occupied

1847824 she came to class prepared always asked good questions and never tried to get any special preferences because im a swimmer i went to see her races she promised me a usc swim cap but ill take an olympic one if she can get it
1847825 nothing can be done for these three people who died
1847826 however at conventional retail locations the customer is likely to be asked for their packaging preference each time the customer passes through a cashier station resulting in unnecessary inconvenience for both the customer and the cashier
1847827 i was consumed by the mystery edward presented and more than a little obsessed by edward himself
1847828 hugely dependent in a number of areas on us intelligence
1847829 any disclosure however limited would seriously undermine this principle to the point that future cooperation between the uk and its most valuable intelligence partner the us would be severely jeopardised
1847830 this would pose a very serious risk to uk national security
1847831 the prime minister of india a democracy which does not have a single al qaida member in a population of 150 million muslims
1847832 one way of looking at the present situation would be to see it as the ultimate breakdown of that phase of western economic development known as financial capitalism
1847833 i no longer believe in the markets self healing power

1847840 my eye is on gordon browns plan for a cabinet meeting outside london to give him and his ministers a chance to engage with the public we will find a room for them to gather in hexham if he wants to engage with the tynedale public about an issue very dear to us via post office ltd the government is embarking on the closure of 17 post offices in tynedale this week the courant will carry a picture of dozens of protesters parading through the normally quiet streets of the sleepy village of humshaugh this is tynedales equivalent of the poll tax protests if mr brown is truly serious about engagement with ordinary people he must not stand idly by while the hearts of our rural communities are torn away

1847850 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1847851 it is completely wrong to suggest that our report was commissioned in april 2006 and the french indictments were in november of that year
1847852 throughout the report there is damning evidence and testimony about the french involvement on diplomatic political and implementation levels there is also evidence that the french army and intelligence groups were working with the government
1847853 they armed them the hutu militias and they supplied those who killed for us it is important that this comes out and that people are tried
1847854 with africa european leaders are willing to talk about darfur and zimbabwe but not it seems about rwanda european leaders need to be asked what they are going to do about this report as africas problems are not just mugabe and zimbabwe
1847855 people cannot be allowed to just say oh this is just another african country genocide is not just a crime against rwanda it is a crime against humanity and as such it should not just be about rwanda fighting this battle alone
1847856 in the political sense the french government greatly helped habyarimanas regime to prepare the course of the genocide
1847857 epas irresponsible inappropriate decision has failed navajo communities and needlessly sacrificed our air land and water
1847858 it is a devastating blow to tribal members who continually suffer from the large coal complex encroaching upon our land
1847859 this is a political decision not one based on science or epas own mandate
1847860 epa ramrodded this permit out the door in response to a lawsuit filed by the coal plant owner whose lawyer jeff holmstead was a high level epa official in the bush administration it looks like hes still giving orders to epas staff
1847861 epa is bending to the will of corporate financial and misguided political interests that will pollute new mexicos skies
1847862 epas decision ignores its obligations to protect the health of residents and the environment in new mexico and the region we will not allow this ill advised decision to stand
1847863 epa is shirking its responsibility to require an analysis of several pollutants including mercury ozone and carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas
1847864 this plant will increase the regions annual greenhouse gas emissions by more than one third and wipe out our efforts to reduce these emissions across the state the four corners area is already burdened with the high levels of mercury contamination and smog and this facility will only worsen those problems
1847865 youre very kind to have produced this record for my family and for the country
1847866 the more people know about their ancestors the greater appreciation they have for who they are individually here and now
1847867 a study of our personal history helps us to respect the struggles that our ancestors endured in a far different world than the one we live in today to give us the prosperity we now enjoy
1847868 the grand institutions which tie this country together the parliaments churches community organizations even our constitution did not appear spontaneously
1847869 the forebears of every living australian contributed to the creation of these structures in one way or another knowing who they were and what they did gives meaning to our place in the present day
1847870 ten years ago the government used a similar charge of sodomy against anwar ibrahim and kept him in jail for six years the conviction was ultimately overturned
1847871 in 1998 amnesty international considered anwar ibrahim a prisoner of conscience today there are again indications that the government is not playing by the rules in this case
1847872 we are also concerned about the safety of all the witnesses in this case particularly dr mohamed osman and we call on the government to provide adequate protection to them
1847873 its fair for the malaysian people and the international community to judge the malaysian governments respect for the rule of law based on how they proceed with this case

1847876 duncan riley is promulgating blogging 2 0 to represent what i consider the erosion of social media by their historic communities under the inexorable rise of flow applications like twitter friendfeed socialmedian and feedly to name only a few i think his description of what is happening is overly simplistic and the appropriation of the term blogging 2 0 is a jingoistic attempt to leverage the paradigm shift magic of the 2 0 suffix
1847877 i thought running was everything my freshman year in college and if i had a bad workout that affected my attitude and mood the whole day
1847878 that was in 2000 and later that year he left brigham young university for a two year mormon mission in thailand
1847879 when i came back from my mission i realized i had life goals and more of a perspective and i knew what values i have and what is most important in my life i have learned not to limit yourself
1847880 i never experimented with drugs or alcohol as an athlete i valued my health but more important my faith taught me to avoid all of those things

1847884 in de winter van 1937 werd in vlissingen een ouder echtpaar vermoord de uitbaters van het caf keersluis ondanks een uitgebreide speuractie van de politie werd het misdrijf nooit opgelost de schrijver heeft een minutieus onderzoek uitgevoerd naar alles wat met de zaak te maken had afkomst achtergronden geruchten doodlopende sporen buren en relaties alles wat maar enigszins in verband met het echtpaar kon worden gebracht daarbij krijgt de lezer een goed beeld van de vlissinger samenleving in de jaren dertig van de 20e eeuw de schrijver had niet de pretentie de moord te kunnen oplossen het was hem onder andere te doen om duidelijk te maken wat voor impact zon moord heeft op een toch vrij gesloten gemeenschap jaren later werd er nog over gepraat de schrijver is zeker geslaagd op boeiende en prettige wijze wordt verslag gedaan van het onderzoek waarbij men zich erover kan verbazen dat er nog zo veel bewaard is gebleven vele functionele fotos verluchtigen het geheel dat vooral voor mensen uit de stad en uit de streek interessant is

1847900 the name at sunset unless you beat an earthen pot and sing your elders sighs will be substantial ominous
1847901 coming to the name the name was steep and deep enter the name do not act flasks of wine tureens in twos of earthenware presented together following the lead no misfortune in the end the name is not full but the earth spirit is placated no misfortune so water
1847902 coming to the pit the put was steep and deep enter the pit do not act the pit is not full but the earth spirit is placated no misfortune
1847903 name the back and not get the body walk the yard and not see the man name the calves and not gain submission his heart is unsatisfied
1847904 throughout his life john has fought for what he believes is right for the united states and for his fellow veterans he lives to serve causes greater than himself he is running for president not to be somebody but to do something that is courage that is leadership john mccain is battle tested in combat and in washington we served with john and know the truth there is no better man to lead us through the challenging times our nation faces today and on to our best days that lie ahead
1847905 i like john mccain and i normally support veterans for any position but im tired of the shit coming from the gop im tired of them pissing on my head and calling it the trickle down effect ill vote for whatever dem gets the nomination
1847906 in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe v
1847907 first checked with mr kennedy before deciding to vote with the massachusetts democrat on an amendment to the senate bill
1847908 i see that most of the folks throwing their support behind mccain are pentagon types not boots on the ground people
1847909 the candidate i find most appealing as a commander in chief is barack obama who has shown integrity in opposing the war in iraq from the very start obama has also lead the effort to clean up walter reed hospital in the nations capital where veterans are treated and has spearheaded efforts to fully fund veterans health care and end the travesty of veterans homelessness he has spoken with courage and conviction on every aspect of military affairs
1847910 there is something in a war carried on by invasion which makes it differ in circumstances from any other mode of war because he who conducts it cannot tell whether the ground he gains be for him or against him
1847911 why would i want to vote for a clown who has no idea what the military is about
1847912 how about you iraqiwarvet who did you vote for the last time was it a traitor or a gold digger
1847913 mccain is a patriot no doubt but a hero is a guy who jumps on a grenade to save his comrades
1847914 sir i am a military man and no matter what i will not let the fact that my son has been captured make any god damned difference in my decisions
1847915 if the people of this country dont band together for the good of this country none of us will have a country which we can call our on anymore
1847916 if the people of this country dont band together for the good of this country none of us will have a country which we can call our on anymore
1847917 if im not mistaken it was wilson democrat that launched us into wwi fdr democrat that launched us into wwii truman democrat that launched us into korea and johnson democrat that launched us into vietnam
1847918 if you dont support the war you dont support the troops
1847919 how did our country get into such a sorry state of affairs that the best we can come up with to vie for leadership in america is the three people running
1847920 it was usually an effective tactic another one of those tricks i had learned people were satisfied so long as you were courteous smiled and made no sudden moves they were more than satisfied they were relieved such a pleasant surprise to find a well meaning young black man who didnt seem angry all the time
1847921 any distinction between good and bad whites held negligible meaning
1847922 relieved when it turned out to be a white person
1847923 for the duration and we won both of those we havent won one since what does that tell you about commitment btw during wwii we lost more bomber crew members daily than we have in all the iraq war to date
1847924 has ceded control of military decisions to general david petraeus
1847925 experience is of no value except as it has forged character
1847926 there is no need here for people to attack col klass he has stated his opionions and after carefully rereading his comments i once again agree with everything the man stated
1847927 bother to take the time to actually read the constitution
1847928 your old school thinking is exactly what continues to plague our country your skewed views about more weapons more safety is misguided
1847929 it is not the presidents job to be a military tactician nor know more about military affairs than those of economics social policy international affairs etc the president must know a lot about a lot certainly but he is not and should not be an individual who is an expert in any field
1847930 the president is the figure head of our nation who surrounds himself with trusted experts in all the aforementioned fields
1847931 therefore it is more important that we have a c in c who is a good judge of character and willing to listen to others
1847932 what people see in him reveals more about them than about him
1847933 its not george bushs fault congress insert issue they are upset about
1847934 bosnia didnt turn into a fiasco like iraq you know why cause clinton didnt have a cabinet of people with stock in kbr and we did it with the rest of the world behind us
1847935 you dont get old by being no fool a lot of young wise men out there and theys deader than a mf
1847936 john mccains new ad is dishonest and shameful and i say that as the former chief of medical operations senators hagel and reed confirmed to bob schieffer yesterday that senator obama visited the combat support hospital in baghdad as a part of their codel with no media present
1847937 in germany senator obama made the right decision to respect wounded troops and the doctors and nurses doing crucial and time sensitive work by not making a visit that was characterized as a campaign event by the pentagon
1847938 senator obama has voted for the troops when john mccain has not most recently on the new gi bill i am happy that senator obama puts the welfare of our troops above politics

1848201 i think apple could sell the developing world tiger while selling leopard here
1848202 the most successful of these products actually take great steps to mask their novelty
1848203 thanks for your comments chris im curious do you think that efficiency was the main reason that apple chose to make the ipod vaguely resemble a 1960s transistor radio or for early tv sets to look like earlier radio consoles or for the first cars to look like horse drawn carriages i really do think this is a pretty universal notion part of this is a willingness to reuse existing mechanism but part of it is merely about communicating a devices purpose through its external design

1848229 sometime i think of abraham how one star he saw was there for me he was a stranger in that land and i am that no less than he
1848230 why does abram go journeying with this strange new god perhaps its because hes heard a voice thats so different so attractive think of it unlike the unknowable gods this god has pursued
1848231 god is beginning the reclamation of planet earth and he goes about it by growing a relationship with one man and this will change everything
1848232 sarah tell them youre my sister so they wont hurt me
1848233 are you serious are you planning on getting rid of the good people right along with the bad what if there are fifty decent people left in the city will you lump the good with the bad and get rid of the lot wouldnt you spare the city for the sake of those fifty innocents i cant believe youd do that kill off the bad and the good alike as if there were no difference between them doesnt the judge of all the earth judge with justice

1848237 stay here with the donkey the boy and i are going over there to worship then well come back to you
1848238 we have flint and wood but wheres the sheep for the burnt offering
1848239 son god will see to it that theres a sheep for the burnt offering
1848240 dont lay a hand on that boy dont touch him now i know how fearlessly you fear god you didnt hesitate to place your son your dear son on the altar for me
1848241 there is an ancient jewish tradition that argues that god never wanted abraham to kill isaac and was hoping that abraham would argue with god and ultimately refuse to carry out the directive
1848242 now abraham i want you to know me well enough to know i wouldnt have you do this and i want you to love your son well enough to bring the issue to me and wrestle it through like you did for sodom come on abraham youre growing now bring your growing home where it matters most why be a hero to strangers and freeze up when those you love most are at risk why not get enough of god that you grow relationships with them like im growing with you why not share this with sarah like i shared with you before i destroyed sodom why not plead with me all the way to moriah like you did when i shared my plans with you before why not act like what you know about me

1848281 jcpenney had been looking for a partner to work in the digital space
1848282 most of the companies they had gone to said heres the widget heres your myspace page and youre done ultimately they reached out to us because we think theres a lot more you can do to engage your target and theres a wealth of techniques to leverage when college age girls leave home its an exciting time for them where they get to meet new people and see new things but at the same time they also need furniture and other stuff and thats where we come in we pitched six ideas for connecting to young women and we think they all went beyond just a regular facebook app dork dodge was the only game like one but when we tried it out the testers loved it
1848283 to create dork dodge we actually started from our young adult targets vantage point ages 17 19 and researched insights into what type of an engagement a young female consumer would find both entertaining and humorous
1848284 we wanted to create something for her that she would feel strongly about and want to pass along to her friends in fact as part of the development we briefed a test group of young women on our four initial marketing ideas and dork dodge was by far their first choice
1848285 we decided to place the dorm life brands interactive page on facebook rather than build a traditional micro site for the same reason
1848286 the focus is to offer females something that is fun and relevant in this case she chose an interactive game and were very excited to deliver that experience for her to enjoy and share as future opportunities emerge well certainly look at games as one of a number of options to engage with our younger customers in a relevant way that is on their terms

1848294 with a strong demand outlook for 2009 the emergence of a number of high potential solar markets in europe and growing sentiment supporting the need for renewable energy we are confident that the solar industry will sustain long term growth we will continue to develop and diversify our silicon channels to ensure we have a stable base of raw material supply to support this industry growth
1848295 we envisage the cost of silicon a key ingredient in pv panels to fall sharply by 2012 to the extent that the cost of pv panels will fall by up to 50
1848296 suntech power has a long standing affinity with australia our founder and global ceo dr shi zhengrong is an australian citizen and developed many of his world leading solar power technologies during his time working at the university of new south wales
1848297 it is important that australia develops a strong solar power industry a robust and growing solar sector will help reduce greenhouse gas emission have a positive impact on our environment and create jobs in new emerging technologies
1848298 increased production scale is largely contingent on healthy ongoing demand in the community if the means test has an adverse effect on public demand it will result in lost installation jobs and the loss of critical installation experience in the sector moreover if vital momentum is lost during these formative years taxpayers will end up paying twice for the same solar megawatts this is due to having to once again provide incentives towards solar power with the additional requirement to once again to re engage consumers after the market disruptions are over if australia wants lower solar power costs in the long run it needs to invest wisely this requires stable long term planning in consultation with the local installation sector whilst fully using other factors such as education
1848299 solar power is an intrinsic public good which is demonstrated through relieving transmission and distribution congestion minimising climate pollution and reducing the number of new power plants with their adverse water usage and environmental impact

1848316 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
1848317 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states it is fortunate that this incident didnt end in a very ugly gunfight
1848318 law enforcement operations have led from time to time to innocent incursions by both u s and mexican law enforcement personnel and military units into the territory of both nations
1848319 we always try to solve these incidents in a cooperative fashion and as acknowledged by the border patrol this was the case in the episode at ajo

1848337 intriguing and guaranteed to make fans desperate to find out what happens next
1848338 we cannot confirm the series climax nor can we guarantee who will survive and who wont
1848339 he has avoided major surgery which is fantastic news for everyone at the club because kenwyne is a big player for us
1848340 he has not done his cruciate which we did not know until he had the surgery so six to eight weeks he will be back in contention for the first team again
1848341 he is a sporting player and thats it theres been plenty of rumours this summer and an offer was made but we rejected it because it wasnt interesting for the club
1848342 i have a contract with rennes and i do understand that rennes want to keep me my contract with the club expires in june 2010 however i am staying this year because i have a good relationship with rennes next year maybe i will want to further my career but i need to respect rennes they gave me the platform to be who i am
1848343 a ground move is certainly crucial to the economic future of everton
1848344 ive said a million times i love goodison park but we have to move we have to get more income into the football club to begin to compete with those clubs weve been discussing
1848345 all that talk last week about david moyes betting suspended on him going and quitting im amazed i am on the phone to him all the time and you wonder where this comes from it seemed to come from the fact that we lost in america last week thats all of course no one is a good loser at everton we never want to lose
1848346 i gave my all at west ham and enjoyed my time there but the decision is the best for the both of us
1848347 i am very happy to be here at blackburn it will be an amazing adventure for me
1848348 you guys are the ones talking about records im the one sitting here knowing what my goal is
1848349 im just going to do what i have to do and im very happy about this and my situation
1848350 im not making pressure for myself im not getting involved in anything that will take me away from anything that i have worked for very hard all these years
1848351 im here to compete in the best swimming facility i have ever seen
1848352 ive had several trips here and each time ive been so impressed i imagine the stands filled with people and i cant wait to compete
1848353 i have done my work and i know what i can do and im all set i havent talked to mark about his record but he was at the trials and he wished me the best i havent said anything about breaking records but im the only one who knows my goals i had some disappointment in athens four years ago when he won a mere six golds but i was satisfied that i had competed well that my effort was good and now i feel stronger and more committed than ever before
1848354 it is too bad some athletes dont have a conscience and say if they win that they are doing it in the right way for my part i have gone beyond the normal demands of testing there are samples of my urine and my blood going back years i have worked for this and for me age is just a number
1848355 because i can only control what i do what others do is for them to deal with i know im clean thats all that matters to me
1848356 was to reach over the table and punch the doctor who was giving me the news
1848357 then he agreed that as the problem was not developing too quickly i could go to the olympics
1848358 and that told me that there are greater challenges and trials than the ones that come in sport
1848359 coketown lay shrouded in a haze of its own which appeared impervious to the suns rays it was a town of machinery and tall chimneys out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever and never got uncoiled
1848360 cannot be sure that its soldiers caught up in a terrifying war alongside merciless killers did not commit the murders rapes and violence of which they are accused
1848361 nothing will change because this is the old soviet union way for the russian sports establishment the desires of a player mean absolutely nothing they are the big bosses it is a dictatorship he is a slave
1848362 we might well start 2008 09 with largely the squad we had last season and after all they didnt do too badly
1848363 we have not brought in the kind of top quality player everyone seems to be expecting we are still looking but it is not easy and certainly we are not desperate
1848364 i hope when the time comes we might be represented in the race
1848365 but im sure he would have no problem in dropping down to the seven furlongs at newmarket hes got the class to do that but he wont run at tipperary because he doesnt fancy soft ground
1848366 i think seven furlongs would suit him better i thought he ran very well at royal ascot on a trip short of his best and on ground that was on the fast side for him
1848367 i would have no problem in stepping him up in distance or indeed dropping gan amhras in trip if either of those two are chosen for the dewhurst
1848368 xabi scored a good goal after scoring a penalty against rangers on saturday so this is very positive
1848369 he is showing that he is a good professional but then we already knew this and i am very pleased with his commitment on the pitch
1848370 the only positive is that the season hasnt started yet
1848371 we said from the start that we wanted the league and we have a bit of pressure on us now to win it
1848372 it was always going to be a pressure game first game of the season away from home to a good team and now there is a wee bit more pressure but we will be up for it we have no european football now now so everyone has to focus on the league and that starts on saturday
1848373 probably most of it will be deserved but we need to get it out of our heads
1848374 i dont think we would have lost that game last season we were a harder team to beat last year
1848375 when i look down the europe team that is a scary list for me
1848376 then its time to say maybe they are beating us because they are just that much better they are great at team play and they seem to have some kind of chemistry that works really really well all you can do is just take your hat off to their dominance in order to beat those guys we are going to have to do something special
1848377 i dont see one single positive that tiger woods isnt on our team
1848378 i cant imagine how you can argue a team would be better off without arguably the greatest player that has ever lived it really puts europe in an advantageous place theres just no question about it
1848379 i was referring to two different nicks theres the old nick and the new nick but we shot a commercial together the other day and we get along just fine if you want to make a big deal out of it you can but i think its fairly a dead issue between the two of us now
1848380 the european press is much harder than in the us and nick could get tabloided to death
1848381 its harder for him to leave out two from sergio garcia paul casey ian poulter and monty colin montgomerie just the way the list is looking for me it wont be case of oh gosh why didnt you pick that guy for nick it might be
1848382 i would love for an american to win this tournament but i expect the europeans to contend
1848383 i think that theres going to be a lot of europeans who played ryder cup at oakland hills in 2004 and have a lot of confidence on this course it would not surprise me one bit if a european won
1848384 he was never happier than when he was creating a big bang and those were the days before the health and safety police
1848385 however roosters do not always crow at dawn if your questioner visits cornwall on 11 august next year she will be able to hear the dawn chorus including the roosters during the false dawn at the end of the total eclipse of the sun which will occur during the middle of the day
1848386 you couldnt miss him in his green sweater could you
1848387 when he spoke everyone sat up and listened and those kind of things always stay with you he knew what i wanted to do and what i wanted to achieve
1848388 he liked clough too the way he was the fact he always spoke his mind coming from the caribbean as we did football was not our main sport but it didnt take much to be drawn to forest
1848389 authority was there to be challenged football and anarchy were my favourite games
1848390 i found out about it before the game we played on the saturday
1848391 the manager said id let you go tomorrow but i cant do that for the money i had a little chuckle myself because no one does business like that so i went to newcastle instead
1848392 i told him if forest get promoted to the championship then yes
1848393 im not going to pull the wool over anyones eyes about that if forest hadnt been promoted last season then all this most probably wouldnt have happened to go two levels down from the premiership is very difficult
1848394 i just hope god willing he gets some results and hopefully that would open a few doors for me sol campbell whoever hes a pioneer for the rest of us
1848395 it was no different with one of my heroes when i was younger cyrille regis
1848396 its about the club being back in the championship and trying to get back into the premiership because that is where they belong
1848397 it doesnt feel like im a senior statesman because im involved in everything im getting dragged into their banter and thinking ive got 12 13 years on some of these guys thats good i know i have to be a leader now it helps that i was once on the wrong side of the line yes i like to think i know about both sides and that will help
1848398 i am going to go in with four fast bowlers and monty panesar
1848399 i think we need the extra bowler it is a positive and aggressive move its one that peter moores and i sing off the same hymn sheet on it is a good start for us
1848400 the thing we have to do is to get back to playing with a real amount of pride and passion and to try and play with confidence and without fear
1848401 i want them to be clear thinking i want the players to express themselves once they step over that white line i want my lads to trust their practice and do whatever they need to do to be successful international cricket can roll in to day in day out train play train play and i want the lads to have a passion to get that pride back
1848402 he had a big smile on his face when i told him he was playing i will give him the responsibility of taking the new ball for england i am confident he can bowl with the new ball he has been doing it for durham lets hope he does a great job i back him i hope i can press the buttons that get harmy firing if he can bowl as he did in the nets he is back properly there is a lot of trust between us i am going to place some responsibility on him and the big man will deliver for us
1848403 he will obviously be hugely motivated excited nervous and have a lot of energy
1848404 it is six months time when you have gone through that process you have carried your team to that level the brand of cricket you want to play and the management of those players
1848405 we want to end the series well and when i am holding up the trophy at the end it would be nice for it to be 3 0 with us having played really well at the oval
1848406 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this cas decision but we respect it
1848407 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself
1848408 a gentlemanly figure the perfect specimen of a guards officer
1848409 we cannot get the information to show whether the site is safe without a rock laboratory but it now appears we cannot win approval for a rock laboratory without showing the site is safe
1848410 it was due to pass near the restaurant at eight in the morning most of the restaurant staff stayed up all night to make sure they didnt miss it i couldnt stay awake that long but i made sure that i was up in time to be out on the road by six there were so many people lining the streets that it was hard to see but i wouldnt have missed it for anything it was a wonderful experience
1848411 does anyone think that ive never heard of anyone saying china should not stage the olympics
1848412 theyre a great team and theyve had so much success over the years
1848413 i was blown away when i was told it was a big surprise and a huge honour
1848414 some of the most wonderful names in british sport have been olympic flag bearers
1848415 making the olympic games this time around was fantastic in itself but this has really topped it off its phenomenal
1848416 i think he did good things for the british team at the grassroots level and i think we are getting some positive and good results off the back of that
1848417 but from my own personal feeling of those years where i was under bills reign its a lot more relaxed ive found the team a lot more relaxed there hasnt been any pack drills and that was my main concern when i was part of the team before
1848418 we have to do our talking in the pool now
1848419 people were talking our chances up like that in 2004 talk is nice but performance is ultimate its good people have recognised the steps made by britains swimmers but we just havent yet converted it
1848420 being at the olympics is huge for us we feel like weve snuck in we keep saying were here were here its just a privilege to be part of something like this
1848421 the way that the jaaa are forcing us to prepare for the olympics that is not what we had in mind
1848422 we believe the people who are doing this preparation have no clue about what they are doing
1848423 we cant leave the hotel because when theres a typhoon at this level eight all the transport is cancelled so unfortunately we are all holed up in a hotel
1848424 im not too bothered about it its similar to a hurricane and its not as bad as it has been but its torrential rain and high winds we are right by the coast so the sea is very rough
1848425 i thought i was so fat i was 130 pounds

1848460 we really need to focus at the convention on unifying the party behind senator obama
1848461 its personal with him in terms of his own legacy
1848462 and the race stuff really left a bad taste in his mouth
1848463 i am not a racist i never made a racist comment
1848464 you could argue that nobody is ever ready to be president
1848465 you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office
1848466 i never said he wasnt qualified the constitution sets qualification for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president i think we have two choices i think he should win and i think he will win
1848467 more people will be using computer read paper ballots than at any other time in the nations history
1848468 as you get more registered voters and more people in the pool it exacerbates this bigger issues of paper
1848469 after 2000 there was a widespread revulsion about paper everyone had the mental image of the guy cross eyed looking at the punch card ballot
1848470 but theres no silver bullet youre trading one set of problems for another
1848471 a lot of officials are in damage control mode because theyre going to try to limit the problems of switching to paper
1848472 you will have ballots not showing up being printed wrong the litany of mistakes voters make with these ballots and then theres incredible pressure in a crowded polling place for people who are trying to make their decision
1848473 paper is traditionally the device that the public is really good at screwing up
1848474 disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now

1848497 a person should not be too honest straight trees are cut first and honest people are victimized first
1848498 the biggest guru mantra is never share your secrets with anybody it will destroy you

1848595 creating an incentive for consumers to shop during a traditionally slow sales period is good for business and our economy this legislation is a win win for buyers and sellers alike a summer sales tax reprieve will boost sales for retailers and deliver discounts to consumers
1848596 over the last four years the economic stimulus generated by the sales tax holiday has delivered a much needed revenue boost to massachusetts businesses during the dog days of summer when businesses experience a growth in sales the overall economic impact on the commonwealth is great and i am pleased to see this bill pass with overwhelming support again this year
1848597 by offering a weekend long sales tax holiday we are giving taxpayers a much needed break its as much a psychological thing as it is economic we remind people that we are looking out for them and are sympathetic to the tough times our constituents are facing i am proud that we were able to accomplish such a beneficial piece of legislation in a bipartisan manner
1848598 the sales tax holiday is important to massachusetts consumers as well as businesses we have seen over the last four years the sales tax holidays repeated success with prices rising across the commonwealth the tax free weekend is something we can do to help consumers as well as boost the economy

1848694 present plan was agreed between japanese and u s governments after giving consideration to various factors including safety and impact of noise
1848695 because the bilateral agreement was made upon comprehensive review it is obvious that it is not easy to change it without a good rational reason
1848696 however it might not be impossible as it is a promise between human beings
1848697 what i have consistently said is that it would not be possible to persuade the other party without grounds that i believe is justifiable and rational
1848698 as long as we have no such rational grounds the present plan will remain unchanged

1848706 do they just wait for the vaccine to come in what if it s too late
1848707 if we had a surplus we would canvass other department of defense sites to see who needed it
1848708 the process to make a safe and effective vaccine takes time and it takes more time to build up enough of them to meet an ongoing shortage

1848768 were honored that the candidates chose the saddleback civil forum on leadership and compassion for their first joint appearance an unprecedented opportunity for america to hear both men back to back on the same platform
1848769 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
1848770 the primaries proved that americans care deeply about the faith values character and leadership convictions of candidates as much as they do about the issues while i know both men as friends and they recognize i will be frank but fair they also know i will be raising questions in these four areas beyond what political reporters typically ask this includes pressing issues that are bridging divides in our nation such as poverty hiv aids climate and human rights

1848778 my friends ive looked at this more closely in light of 4 a gallon gas and i realize i was wrong but i will swallow my pride and gladly admit error if it means helping lift the burden of high energy costs on american consumers
1848779 typically people are only treated in major metropolitan areas this model turned out to be very effective we had significant outcomes
1848780 i hope to be able to work with governments to develop a community based treatment for people who are on disability support pensions and that fits in with the australian governments
1848781 words cease to be the mode of transaction so we have to communicate in ways that are socially discouraged for example were so cerebrally oriented that we dont touch each other alzheimers gives us a chance to remember that the only thing that fulfills us emotionally is meaningful communication
1848782 i dont mean to be flippant here but the fact that we would ask that question says a lot about what we have lost or forgotten we dont know who we are outside this experience through this connecting we will begin to remember who we are
1848783 turned into a population of consumers this keeps us happily disconnected from who we are weve forgotten in such a profound way that we cant understand anything unless we ask how we can monetize it
1848784 there are a lot of cultural assumptions around the idea of identity that make memory loss terrifying
1848785 and theres a vested interest behind the pictures of memory loss that terrify us but it depends whether you think your identity resides in your neurons ill give you an example my grandfather was very religious so his identity was in being reunited with his family in heaven he had no existential anxiety about his diagnosis of memory loss another example is if you live with extended family then your identity is kin oriented and memory resides in the collective organism the dread associated with memory loss will diminish if we remember that our identities live in our relationships and not in our neurons
1848786 the dread associated with memory loss will diminish if we remember that our identities live in our relationships and not in our neurons
1848787 we firmly believe in and are committed to giving a voice to people with dementia
1848788 and we attempt to integrate them in every aspect of our work we are proud to have had two people with dementia serve on the adi elected board their voice has been central to our deliberations at each of our annual international conferences people with dementia have participated as plenary speakers and workshop leaders
1848789 if the aspirin is being used for heart or brain vascular disease that might prevent the worsening of cognition or dementia
1848790 after the onset of dementia anti inflammatory treatment does not seem to work
1848791 at present there is only one randomized trial and that is adapt in which treatment had to be stopped early
1848792 it does not support the idea that within a few years of dementia onset the nsaids used prevent alzheimers disease as the observational studies suggest other nsaids might or the same ones might if given for longer and or earlier in life
1848793 still right now people are not advised to use nsaids to treat or prevent alzheimers disease or memory disorders
1848794 these drugs carry risks and as we found in adapt some may have the possibility of being harmful to cognition
1848795 this is the attentional subset of our cognitive test system
1848796 the attention tests measure your ability to focus process information and sustain attention while memory loss is the classical symptom of the dementias our research has shown that poor attention is an important deficit in alzheimers disease as well as memory loss and that in other types of dementia for example lewy body dementia and parkinsons dementia it is one of the central deficits
1848797 we compared your results to our database of over 6000 healthy individuals aged 18 to 87 who also performed the tests for the first time
1848798 we see a linear decline with advancing age and we took your age from the average speed of your responses
1848799 and the more important thing is how your scores hold up over time there are large inter individual variations in scores and what is most valuable is to be able to identify when performance on various measures begins to decline if this occurs and on re testing the decline is still present this would be a cue to visit the doctor for a checkup
1848800 the reason why age is a risk factor for pocd remains to be determined
1848801 with the release of the final ff3 in mid june it will be interesting to watch to see if this causes a significant bump in the july numbers
1848802 we are looking for changes that have been identified in parts of the limbic system a part of the brain that regulates emotions and memory of animals subjected to chronic stress for example changes in the receptors for stress hormones if these changes also occur in humans they could explain why depression is associated with loss of cognition and they might suggest novel ways of trying to delay the symptoms of dementia for example in animals stress related damage to the brain is reduced by a number of things including antidepressants exercise and certain dietary changes
1848803 an exciting development in alzheimers research has been that a number of lifestyle and personality factors appear to affect the risk of developing dementia but do not seem to be related to the pathologic lesions in the brain that we traditionally associate with alzheimers and other forms of dementia
1848804 ill make the semi provocative statement that we still do not fully understand the causes of alzheimers disease and there is plenty of room for alternative theories to the dominant amyloid hypothesis
1848805 seek as enriched an environment as possible get good exercise eat fresh fruits and vegetables and a little bit of fish solve crossword puzzles and dont forget some good red wine i cant guarantee youll prevent alzheimers but the side effects will be mild and you may enjoy the experience

1848817 but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words shalt thou be condemned
1848818 there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one
1848819 to believe without evidence and demonstration is an act of ignorance and folly
1848820 i have many things to say unto you but ye can not bear them now
1848821 whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremias or one of the prophets
1848822 o que tenho um olhar rom ntico sobre o mundo
1848823 he should be a little bit more careful what he says but i dont think it will cost him much
1848824 i think this will bring everyone behind him because its dirty tricks
1848825 i know it is hard to believe its hard to fathom but this is mission accomplished for them
1848826 they want americans to take transit and move to the inner cities they want americans to move to the urban core live in tenements and take light rail to their government jobs thats their vision for america
1848827 the attack on marriage as the union of a man and a woman
1848828 concerned about the dangers of legalizing same sex marriage and the related erosion of a culture of marriage and marital families
1848829 they fuckin play this song on every station im sick of it
1848830 oh damn that sucks what kind of car is it
1848831 i drive an old car too but shit as long as it gets me places im good
1848832 this thing hauls ass man its like a 2006 sienna or something but it hauls ass so you got a girlfriend or something
1848833 yeah that shit high school sweetheart thats good shit man good for you
1848834 fuck no but if youre looking for a job i think theyre hiring but yeah you should look on craigslist you know that site just go there and check out the jobs and shit theyve always got something
1848835 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1848836 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
1848837 weve had organic growth with ebay but as merchants migrated off the ebay platform by building their own sites theyve brought us with them
1848838 by the back half of 2009 the international business will exceed our north american business
1848839 the more mature the technology the less relevant the show
1848840 this is just the medium that people used now you can go to the web or to your local retailer
1848841 when you get the chance ping him for his contact information
1848842 we did a deep dive of that telecom company but we still need to drill down on their margins
1848843 my bandwidth is getting too sapped by the january report
1848844 i dont have the bandwidth to work on another report right now
1848845 its all i could carry and i aint got pockets
1848846 nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution
1848847 if tylenol duct tape and a band aid cant fix it you have a serious problem
1848848 at that time i argued it wasnt a good business case because the ridership just wasnt there
1848849 i recommend you terminate the shuttle today and not go through another six months because even in another two or three years youre not going to increase the ridership
1848850 current ridership is falling below the necessary levels to achieve mississauga transits cost recovery target of 55 per cent
1848851 i suggested at the time that we put the route and a big 1 sign the cost of the ride on the side of the bus so people could see it as it goes by
1848852 what youve produced is a bus that looks like any other bus the element of fun and attaching it to the city centre and my mississauga are not evident on that bus at all

1848860 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1848861 the olympic games are about the athletes the active athletes that are competing joey cheek had no formal role and is not accredited in any capacity so in that sense he is a normal citizen who requires a visa like any other as such this is really a matter for the chinese government to respond to not the ioc
1848862 the fact that parents feel compelled to monitor their children on this scale should send a powerful message to the big social networking sites
1848863 with three quarters of a million underage users in the uk facebook myspace and bebo need to take their own age restriction policies far more seriously to help allay parents real fears
1848864 children are at the vanguard of the social networking phenomenon using sites such as facebook and bebo in the same way other generations used the telephone with the summer holidays upon us and kids spending hours on the internet busy parents cant be expected to monitor their childrens activities all the time
1848865 the combined effects of these shocks raised uncertainty increased inflation risks and compounded the ongoing correction in the domestic housing market
1848866 a run on northern rock raised the spectre of financial stability weakness feeding through to the real sector
1848867 so far in 2008 evidence points to a sharp slowing in activity alongside high inflation
1848868 second quarter growth was weak forward looking indicators are gloomy sterling money market spreads remain elevated unemployment has edged up and house prices are falling rapidly
1848869 gordon browns economic incompetence is now famous around the world his fiscal rules are in tatters inflation is forecast to remain above target and his system for bank regulation failed its first serious test the imf report is a damning judgment on almost every aspect of his legacy as chancellor
1848870 given the outlook for inflation and the stance of fiscal policy imf directors saw little scope for monetary easing at present
1848871 underpinned this remarkable performance will be tested by lower growth higher inflation from food and fuel price increases ongoing strains in financial markets rapid house price reversals and medium term external imbalances the financial sector strains have also triggered a broad based effort to reform the financial stability framework
1848872 hugely dependent in a number of areas on us intelligence
1848873 any disclosure however limited would seriously undermine this principle to the point that future cooperation between the uk and its most valuable intelligence partner the us would be severely jeopardised
1848874 this would pose a very serious risk to uk national security
1848875 although these treatments are clinically effective regrettably the cost to the nhs is such that they are not a cost effective use of nhs resources
1848876 the possibility that we clinicians may be prevented from offering sutent to our patients is an outrage and a devastating blow to the kidney cancer community
1848877 todays announcement marks the next step in our strategy to develop a significant platinum business and add further scale and diversification to our portfolio
1848878 opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1848879 given our long term negative stance towards lonmin which has been fuelled by our concerns at its operational performance we advise investors to sell into the strength created by this offer
1848880 i admit that i have been under much influence of militant free tibet organisations back home what china is doing now and what china has done are so different and i am angry with myself for not realising the distinction before now
1848881 this certainly sounds unlike anything lucy would have written i saw the original and i certainly have no memory of anything like that figuring in it it doesnt sound like her phraseology she read classics she writes beautifully and this doesnt sound at all like her style quite apart from her sentiments i would imagine its been done today students for a free tibet have in the past had tampering with their own internal emails
1848882 we could feel the atmosphere of oppression just walking through the streets and monasteries our guide was hushed by a monk when he uttered 14th dalai lama and guiltily giggled as he mentioned the official 11th panchen lama the 2nd most important leader in tibet before china who is a chinese replacement for the real panchen lama who has been in prison since his recognition at the age of 6
1848883 even so monks are not being tortured on the streets as the impression is given and in fact just seem to get on with their business within their monasteries or walk around the streets seemingly unbothered the chinese maintains sic an impressive presence and there is still a large amount of han immigration which is sad but nothing to the extent that is advertised at home
1848884 it is something that we are pretty used to i am just surprised that they didnt take it down instead of trying to misrepresent her views
1848885 there will certainly be people of conscience who will try to speak out in peaceful ways while the world spotlight is on china
1848886 we have done this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool to whitewash their human rights
1848887 as far as we know foreigners gathered illegally and we express our strong opposition to that
1848888 we will resist all attempts to politicise the olympics we have laws regarding assembly and demonstrations and we hope that foreigners will respect the laws of china
1848889 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists we speak out not to antagonise chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential

1848892 keep in mind that these agents are looking on the ground for tracks it takes concentration when youre cutting sign its easy to focus in on the ground and lose track of whats happening around you
1848893 what irks me about it is that anytime mexico gets an incursion theres a big investigation conducted by the mexicans and the mexican congress starts firing off diplomatic letters of protest
1848894 this decision once again raises questions about whether nices system of appraisal is appropriate for all types of drugs
1848895 although we understand that nice often has to make difficult decisions in this case there is a clear separation between what nice finds to be valuable treatment and clinical and patient opinion
1848896 nice has to decide what treatments represent best value to the patient as well as the nhs
1848897 although these treatments are clinically effective regrettably the cost to the nhs is such that they are not a cost effective use of nhs resources
1848898 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process
1848899 we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1848900 having no convictions after six plus years was a black mark but having a conviction after a process that was unfair to begin with and that was largely conducted in secret does not begin to erase the black mark
1848901 in the strange world of guant namo justice even if hamdan had been acquitted on all charges he would have been detained indefinitely
1848902 weve got a shambles that brings us no closer to justice
1848903 by pooling resources and expertise we will be able to produce more world class research in key areas including cancer and heart disease and deliver the benefits more rapidly to patients
1848904 we have chosen to concentrate on these areas because in all of them we are already leading the way in the uk or europe our goal is to build on that reputation and become genuinely world class in as many of those areas as possible
1848905 this is about london positioning itself internationally other research centres are emerging in dubai singapore and shanghai they have superlative research facilities and large catchment areas of patients which is attractive to pharmaceutical companies conducting clinical trials
1848906 she was a seemingly passionate advocate of gun violence prevention yet she refused to be a local spokesman in florida where she lived she didnt want her name in the press or press releases
1848907 it is beyond my comprehension how someone could have listened to my story and expressed desire to help prevent others from having to experience the agony i went through all the time collecting money as a gun lobby spy
1848908 a lot of us are wondering who else is spying on us and whether we would recognise them
1848909 the eu should make up its mind with regard to the political objective of achieving a euro atlantic area of cooperation with the united states in the field of freedom security and justice
1848910 a country that in privacy terms is all but lawless us privacy laws are weak they offer little protection to citizens and virtually none to non citizens
1848911 relevant security related information should be available to all security authorities in the member states
1848912 tor lets you see what the world looks like from someone elses net connection
1848913 observers could look at the tor servers end to end exit points you have to connect to tor and it downloads a list of the possible tor nodes that you could connect to
1848914 tor is getting really tricky for the chinese to stop because getting a list of all the bridges is almost impossible
1848915 so our wish is that people out there who can spare the bandwidth for open exit and middle nodes will contribute its not something that we can entirely do alone
1848916 when those organisations put out their news what effort are they taking to ensure that other people in china could get access to it
1848917 this isnt exactly what i pictured of when i thought of medical school
1848918 the surgeons develop an increased efficiency less errors more fluid movement basically theyre just better
1848919 we can always tell the surgeons who are gamers because theyre naturally better
1848920 but what were finding with the wii is that the surgeons that use it regularly are achieving results that far outstrip those who have just gamed before and thats because the wii is very different
1848921 the whole point about surgery is to execute small finely controlled movements with your hands
1848922 then we saw people using the wii and noticed the precision of some movements looked very similar
1848923 you dont gain a lot from swinging an imaginary tennis racket
1848924 a laparoscope is inserted into the abdomen through small incisions theres a camera in the probe and surgeons work off monitors very small instruments are used and they are controlled by the smallest of hand movements
1848925 during minimally invasive surgeries there is reduced exposure of vital organs meaning a reduced risk of infection there is also reduced blood loss meaning reduced need for transfusions and patients can get out of hospital and back home sooner
1848926 in the countries i work in where risk of infection is high and supply of blood and beds is short any cheap development that can lead to fewer open procedures is incredibly exciting
1848927 but what makes it exciting are minds like dr kahol and smiths who look at everyday inexpensive technologies and think how could i use that
1848928 well i know i should really buy one for home but i still keep holding out hope that the hospital might give me one for research
1848929 i was consumed by the mystery edward presented and more than a little obsessed by edward himself
1848930 i have always thought that the congestion charge is a blunt instrument it has proved successful in cutting traffic coming into london but on its own has not resolved the problem of congestion various works and schemes going on in the capital have also eroded its impact i am therefore introducing a more comprehensive approach to easing congestion
1848931 congestion would be a lot worse were it not for the charge
1848932 it is disappointing that the charge is not doing what it says on the tin which is to reduce congestion
1848933 never mind your biological family may not be coming to your wedding but the family of your choosing will all be there to celebrate with you
1848934 they said we dont have those sorts of problems here
1848935 the kids spent their time chucking meat at each other they told me when they qualified they wanted to become criminals because it was a more interesting life the cars the girls i was shocked
1848936 ill give you such a kicking your mother will have to scrape you off the floor with a spatula
1848937 we picked up the language in the classroom in the playgrounds
1848938 the variety of expressions is mind blowing and the girls are no better than the boys
1848939 i was 30 when the war started then i had no idea what mass grave meant but theyve incorporated it into their language its part of their culture
1848940 if i get hold of you amor masovic wont be able to recognise you
1848941 it just begins to scratch the surface of the bosnian catastrophe
1848942 lots of families have someone whose bones were never found i went to a psychologist to ask what i could do about my anxiety attacks i see pictures in my head of the war the bloody bodies she said i would just have to live with it
1848943 my ma was shocked by the rudeness of it and said she couldnt feel her legs after but what most shocked her was how close to her experience of the classroom it was
1848944 measles is serious and in some cases it can be fatal delaying immunisation puts children at risk
1848945 if we continue to accumulate unvaccinated children measles will spread among them at some point there will be a measles epidemic
1848946 the evidence on mmr is absolutely clear there is no link between the vaccine and autism
1848947 we cannot stress too strongly that all children and young people should have the mmr vaccine
1848948 it could eventually offer patients who have had transplant surgery a much higher quality of life free from complex drug regimes
1848949 our research clearly shows that infusing taics into patients before they have a kidney transplant or after the procedure has been carried out is a practical and safe clinical option
1848950 although this procedure is still being developed and refined it poses an exciting possibility for clinicians and patients alike
1848951 this is interesting work which has the potential to both reduce the risk of rejection after organ transplantation and the amount of anti rejection drugs that are required both of which will be good news for patients
1848952 as the authors say this is still early and preliminary work and further development and refinement of the process is required but this procedure does seem to have potential
1848953 i think well get you started on the childs hurdles
1848954 rather than climb back on that damned camel i should prefer to run those two miles on foot
1848955 people didnt think delicate women were up to doing steeplechase
1848956 see how hard that is so when you jump over it ideally you should clear the water or only one foot should land in it
1848957 i reckon we can bring it down to at least 25 ok
1848958 all your strength is coming from your arms which is fine in distance swimming but when it comes to sprinting you need to go to your legs
1848959 youre in a 7ft circle youre starting at 0mph youre jumping across the circle and letting go of the shot the shot comes out of your hand at 40mph
1848960 thats faster than a sprinter out of the blocks its the most explosive aggressive event you can do
1848961 he was a big bastard im a small bastard and we had lots of good competitions together
1848962 it takes eight to 10 years to teach someone to throw properly
1848963 with five years weight training you could be 17st and then id have you throwing discus 50m
1848964 its a lovely feeling letting go of the shot and finishing and the shot is still in the air
1848965 the great throws are the easiest because your sequential development of power is so good by the time you let go the shot feels as light as a feather
1848966 his saying was youve got to put the shot through the hole in the sky
1848967 europe being the home of fencing has all the best fencers
1848968 its like a very fast game of scissors paper stone
1848969 thats not too bad by the end of this session ill have you cartwheeling off the competition level beam
1848970 tuck your head in keep your core muscles strong snap your legs together at the top twist your hips at the end
1848971 it would depend on the individual athlete but high level gymnasts would probably train for two four hour sessions six days a week
1848972 if we win a medal it will be wonderful for the sport
1848973 when it comes to a technical event you need to have started to develop the basics early on and a lot of kids come to sport now lacking basic skills you end up trying to explain what 10 or 15 years ago people would have just learned by playing in the street
1848974 no offence to my sprinting colleagues but in those events you just point yourself and run in high jump you have to transform horizontal speed to vertical height in the takeoff
1848975 you dont really expect me to go down that do you
1848976 anche io ci scherzo con loro fraternamente a volte per far accettare certi discorsi religiosi uso un tono non severo informale semplice normale del tipo

1848978 this is better than we thought the universe is much bigger than our prophets said grander more subtle more elegant god must be even greater than we dreamed
1848979 no no no my god is a little god and i want him to stay that way

1849232 there are huge pressures on housing in this country and one of the things im looking to respond to is the housing industry associations call for the fact they cant get building tradesmen and one of the things ive been pressing the department on is us trying to be responsive in this years program for the need to find construction workers and bricklayers carpenters etc and make the program meet these shortages in australia
1849233 that high migration to melbourne explained the building boom despite areas of concentrated residential building activity throughout some areas of victoria we are still producing 5000 new homes less than required each year

1849235 we employ individuals with disabilities as part of the training and employment opportunities we provide
1849236 our thrift shop donations have continued to decrease and were trying to get the word out to the general public to let them know we are in desperate need of items
1849237 weve always received very good support from the community over the years
1849238 but we are in need more so than we have ever been
1849239 the program is a learning experience for the less fortunate and the handicapped it gives us a sense of direction we like it here and we like the people who are over us
1849240 we have customers who come to see how we are doing
1849241 it lets us know that we are somebody in the eyes of god
1849242 it gives opportunities to help other people who are not as fortunate
1849243 i have grandkids who outgrow their clothes and i can donate them to others
1849244 i will never stop coming i am always telling others about it
1849245 were being taken for fools by the iraqi government that continues to take in american money to pay for their reconstruction
1849246 their excuse is they dont have a bureaucracy thats capable of writing checks
1849247 thats about as feeble an excuse it would be laughable if it werent so serious
1849248 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills is a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1849249 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1849250 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1849251 will be compared to each other along with those of the mummy of king tutankhamun
1849252 we want to find out the truth and facts relevant to the history of these kings
1849253 it is doubtful that it could produce a scientific result to determine such important issues such as the lineage of pharaohs
1849254 we said in the referendum that we didnt want that and now hes put it in the decrees
1849255 thats the problem we have all the powers are concentrated in the president
1849256 youre afraid of the people and you president hid behind the supreme court
1849257 if you had told me at the time that we published the turnaround plan where we would be in 2008 which nobody forecast and nobody could have forecast of course our plan would have been different
1849258 this is a cyclical problem it is not a structural problem we are going through a downturn that does not change the fundamentals of the business
1849259 television viewing is at its highest level for 16 years so we are doing something right
1849260 it is unarguable now that ofcom needs to take quick action to redress the imbalance in the value of the licence and that which we are required to provide
1849261 we would prefer to retain our public service broadcaster status but not at any price the issue is the timing and how quickly we could get to a sensible accommodation and not have to spend way in excess of the value of that licence providing public service broadcasting
1849262 confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1849263 we believe that the evening standards front page story today wednesday titled prince philip defies cancer scare is a serious breach of prince philips privacy
1849264 buckingham palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy particularly in relation to their personal health
1849265 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumours that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
1849266 we will continue to observe this long standing practice but on this occasion because the damaging story is now being reported widely the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1849267 we believe there has been a serious breach of the duke of edinburghs right to privacy and we will be taking this issue to the press complaints commission
1849268 we will be asking the pcc to remind all editors of their obligations
1849269 everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life home health and correspondence
1849270 editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individuals private life without consent
1849271 we have been informed that we will be receiving a complaint regarding the duke of edinburgh story over clauses one and three of the code accuracy and privacy but we have not yet received it
1849272 we updated the story for the later edition we will respond to any potential inquiry from the pcc but we do believe that there is a public interest in the health of the duke of edinburgh
1849273 an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness

1849277 a major gaffe by the normally well oiled obama campaign machinery
1849278 once again the oil companies and their friends are standing with sen mccain the candidate for president who is proposing to offer them a 4 billion tax cut
1849279 it looks like gas station tv doesnt want the american people to know about sen obamas plan to offer working families a 1 000 energy rebate that would be funded by a tax on oil company profits
1849280 the oil companies have taken sides in this race and they are standing with john mccain because they know hes been in washington for 26 years and can be counted on to pursue for another four years of the bush energy policy thats made them billions of dollars
1849281 please note totals are for 2 weeks in each of the four markets
1849282 gas station tv was considering running political ads and we have been approached by a few campaigns we have made a conscious decision not to run political ads on our network
1849283 at no time did gas station tv approve the campaign or receive
1849284 at a time when presidential campaign ads monopolize prime time we believe it is important to be able to provide traditional advertisers with a clutter free environment to showcase their brands and target marketing messages to a captive audience
1849285 elizabeth dole hasnt scheduled a single public stump speech in the past week even though she has been on break from her work in congress dole spent the past week of the easter congressional recess raising money

1849290 i think its all to the good for north carolina when either the president or the vice president makes an appearance in our state
1849291 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him
1849292 we are all safer today because of the outstanding and painstaking investigative work of the agents of the fbi and atf on this case
1849293 we were very fortunate that no one was seriously injured as a result of this egregious and destructive event

1849295 we need to get used to the idea that scientists will make incremental advances as we go forward and we will learn from them
1849296 failure is part of the game we have to get used to the idea of candidates failing during the trial
1849297 it has taken africa 4 5 years to build the infrastructure and capacity for us to be able to carry out vaccine trials
1849298 feed into hiv vaccine discovery drug discovery and bring all these other preventive technologies
1849299 we see the failure of the merck trials as a failure of a product but not the failure of the trial
1849300 we cannot stop now we are ready and are going to be a part of the solution
1849301 the hiv vaccine research field is at a crossroads this is going to be a long journey and we need to capture the best minds and attract young researchers
1849302 we all have to just not give up we need to reinforce our commitment to a vaccine
1849303 i dont know why they have picked me but they are not to be feared they are very loving intelligent and will only present themselves to those who accept them
1849304 sometimes you get raptures like strong orgasms and you dont know where it comes from it is energies being passed down to their children on earth they are a good race who only like to help others
1849305 before they go theyve got to ask whether they need as much electronics as they usually carry with them

1849311 no we did not receive any money back from the obama campaign at any time
1849312 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
1849313 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
1849314 it is fortunate that this incident didnt end in a very ugly gunfight
1849315 it is not an incident that we are aware of
1849316 an all out struggle to deter criminal organizations from operating on both sides of our common border
1849317 law enforcement operations have led from time to time to innocent incursions by both u s and mexican law enforcement personnel and military units into the territory of both nations and in particular along non demarcated areas of our border

1849320 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
1849321 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go

1849324 us attacked by terrorist gang masterminds driver gets life seven years later
1849325 thank you for contacting me about karl roves failure to appear before the judiciary committee i appreciate that you took the time to share your thoughts with me the judiciary committee is taking karl roves failure to testify very seriously and we are currently considering all options including contempt proceedings to compel him to answer important questions regarding the firing of several u s attorneys some have suggested that congress implement inherent contempt as if that is a viable option the jail cell in the basement of the capitol doesnt exist and the sergeant at arms is an over 60 year old executive congress is not a police force and we will likely need to continue to utilize the courts and system of justice to pursue these matters again thanks for being in touch please do not hesitate to let me know if i may ever be of assistance to you or your family
1849326 resolved that rooms a and b opposite the room of the solicitor of the court of claims in the capitol be and are hereby assigned as guardroom and office of the capitol police and are for that purpose placed under charge of the sergeant at arms of the house with power to fit the same up for purpose specified resolved that said wooley for his repeated contempt of the authority of the house be kept until otherwise ordered by the house in close confinement in the guardroom of the capitol police by the sergeant at arms until said wooley shall fully answer the questions above recited and all questions put to him by said committee in relation to the subject of the investigations with which the committee is charged and that meanwhile no person shall communicate with said wooley in writing or verbally except upon the order of the speaker
1849327 under the inherent contempt power the house sergeant at arms has the authority to take karl rove into custody and bring him to the house where his contempt case can be tried presumably by a standing or select committee if he is found by the house to be in contempt of congress he can be imprisoned for an amount of time determined by the house not to exceed the term of the 110th congress which ends the beginning of january 2009 or until he agrees to testify the supreme court has recognized the power of the house to enforce its own subpoenas through the inherent contempt provision stating that without it congress would be exposed to every indignity and interruption that rudeness caprice or even conspiracy may mediate against it before congress asked the justice department to try contempt cases on its behalf the inherent contempt power was used more than 85 times between 1795 and 1934 mostly to compel testimony and documents
1849328 both chambers also have an inherent contempt power allowing either body to hold its own trials and even jail those found in defiance of congress although widely used during the 19th century the power has not been invoked since 1934 and democratic lawmakers have not displayed an appetite for reviving the practice
1849329 u s code title 2 the congress chapter 6 congressional and committee procedure investigations sec 193 privilege of witnesses no witness is privileged to refuse to testify to any fact or to produce any paper respecting which he shall be examined by either house of congress or by any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two houses of congress or by any committee of either house upon the ground that his testimony to such fact or his production of such paper may tend to disgrace him or otherwise render him infamous

1849331 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
1849332 by design those attacks put the american population into a state of intense fear of islamic terrorism far more than the 9 11 attacks alone could have accomplished
1849333 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
1849334 this is not intended to be a mere discussion of violations of law that have occurred
1849335 it is rather intended to be a planning conference at which plans will be laid and necessary organizational structures set up
1849336 will it completely stop them from coming across of course not
1849337 rest assured there will eventually be holes in parts of the wall made by people trying to get in but it buys us valuable time
1849338 the great wall of china did not stop the mongols and the berlin wall didnt stop people escaping to freedom why do they think this will be any different
1849339 is a political initiative meant to satisfy conservatives in congress who have played to fears about all immigrants being terrorists criminals and living off the dole
1849340 we have no idea to what extent we can enforce our own laws
1849341 the consequences of an open border are smuggling of drugs and human beings into this country
1849342 intensified and mixed anti immigrant racist views with a law enforcement only approach towards immigration
1849343 the main immigration flow has not stopped coming it just shifted
1849344 in other words the same number or more people are crossing the border
1849345 the wall is symptomatic of the fact that the us is not responsive to a rational immigration policy
1849346 the fact that notices of default declined from may to june is a positive sign
1849347 the big question is will that trend continue or is it a seasonal factor
1849348 i think the lenders are so inundated with properties they are becoming more open to modifications and forbearances
1849349 it would not surprise me if we peak in mortgage defaults sometime in the next one to three quarters
1849350 but what really matters is when foreclosure activity will recede enough to release its grip on many housing markets especially inland areas where post foreclosure sales now dominate the resale market
1849351 buy real estate when there is blood in the streets
1849352 in fact if you look at where home prices fell the most its the markets were sub prime loans were prevalent
1849353 while much of the media is focusing on the fact that the rate of foreclosures doubled this year from historic averages the foreclosure rate has gone from 1 percent of all homeowners with mortgages to 2 percent foreclosures are being driven principally by subprime loans
1849354 now that the sub prime market has dried up and loans insured by the federal housing administration and those purchased by fannie mae and freddie mac are making a comeback the housing markets will strengthen and prices are likely to begin a steady up tick in the coming months

1849368 ah you have been to blame you led us into darkness when you were seeking fame
1849369 you preached your deadly doctrine we thought you knew the way we fed you and we clothed you we even raised your pay youve robbed us of a home where no tear drops ever flow where days are always fair and the heavnly breezes blow where living streams are flowing and saints and angels sing where every one is happy and hallelujahs ring were in this place of torment from which no soul returns we hear the cry of lost ones we feel the sizzling burns give us a drop of water were tortured in this flame you failed to preach salvation to us through jesus name

1849384 there are three areas of study in which a person who is going to be good and noble must be trained that concerning desires and aversions so that he may never fail to get what he desires nor fall into what he would avoid that concerning the impulse to act and not to act and in general appropriate behavior so that he may act in an orderly manner and after due consideration and not carelessly the third is concerned with freedom from deception and hasty judgment and in general whatever is connected with assent
1849385 when i see a man anxious i say what does that man want if he did not want something which is not in his power how could he be anxious

1849388 but what is philosophy does it not mean making preparation to meet things that come upon us
1849389 the preferred indifferents have value for a stoic but not in terms of their being good they have an instrumental value with respect to their capacities to contribute to a flourishing life as the objects upon which our virtuous actions are directed
1849390 some things are up to us and some things are not up to us our opinions are up to us and our impulses desires aversions in short whatever is our own doing our bodies are not up to us nor are our possessions our reputations or our public offices or that is whatever is not our own doing

1849394 an event that demonstrates the instability of the internet and that inspires the government to a response
1849395 in the absence to a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for our incentives package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive given that we dont have a decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1849396 we are beginning to consider the possible outline for another sanction resolution
1849397 such mutual clarification can pave the way for a speedy and transparent negotiating process with a bright prospect
1849398 the republic of iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1849399 the second phase of negotiations can commence as early as possible if there is such willingness
1849400 our offer is clear and their response is not clear
1849401 the iranian government needs to respond in a very clear way to the generous offer from the international community
1849402 to be fair to the iranians they do this kind of thing rather well
1849403 i dont see any reason to believe that the russians and the chinese are any more willing today to support really tougher sanctions against iran
1849404 shutting down the strait closing down the persian gulf would be sort of a self defeating exercise
1849405 that doesnt say anything about whether we tolerate such a thing to happen
1849406 i dont think it is in irans interest to shut down the strait of hormuz or the persian gulf or attempt to do so
1849407 they have a very weak economy at this point which depends almost entirely on their oil revenue agence france presse iv spacewar com aug 5

1849409 discovered this doing a forensic examination of an iphone 3g it appears to be tucked away in a configuration file deep inside corelocation
1849410 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down

1849419 both the harassment and the criminal damage offences were targeted very often to homes of the individuals involved and were vindictive in nature
1849420 by your own admission this course of action was intimidatory
1849421 the nightmare of the last three years may finally be coming to an end
1849422 this has been a traumatic period for all those who have suffered from his vile campaign to defame intimidate and terrorise people simply for expressing support for a political party
1849423 failed to investigate the matter properly and to ensure that such an appalling course of events is never repeated
1849424 this was a disgraceful and criminal campaign aimed at intimidating candidates and voters and subverting the democratic process

1849521 the way he treated people thats the biggest thing about bobby especially if youre a young player coming up in new york he had always the most positive things to say whether you were good or bad he always went out of his way to speak with you
1849522 the yankees were not very good when i fell in love with the game
1849523 but as a kid growing up in the bronx there was just something about bobby and i was not alone there are people my age that all looked at bobby ray murcer in the years of bad baseball we had bobby murcer
1849524 i didnt meet bobby until about a year ago but i felt like i knew the man
1849525 it was just the way he lived his life and he let us watch
1849526 i mean he was just a great man just a great person to be around he lived a wonderful life

1849533 theyre going to erect a statue of me here azinger joked to the gallery wednesday during a practice round for the pga championship that starts thursday
1849534 the monster though got the last laugh because azinger missed the putt
1849535 its going to be a huge factor kenny perry predicted
1849536 yeah were going to have to do that because you cant putt it across these greens perez said after tapping a putt to the left and watching it break hard downhill catching the edge of the cup before rolling past
1849537 and in only one day its crazy how much faster and harder they are
1849538 nine and 17 are very very difficult jim furyk said
1849539 they were already tough holes when we had say a 4 iron in our hand but now with 3 woods theyre very difficult
1849540 three is the easiest of the group justin leonard said
1849541 but this is certainly the hardest group of par 3s ive ever played
1849542 you know if youre hitting those clubs youre going to miss some of those greens garcia said
1849543 even hitting a good shot youre going to miss some of those greens
1849544 then it can get quite tricky around the greens chipping can be quite tricky around it and even putting can be quite tricky around it
1849545 when you think about it one day you could actually save somebodys life to me thats something really important that you should do said linebacker austin box who sat down at a table to complete his screening shortly after stoops got done
1849546 we thought it would be like anything else a one year thing you go in you go out the doctors didnt mention a bone marrow transplant or anything well do treatment were good to go said roger anderson tallies dad

1849549 these guys are young their cells are viable they will be able to donate for many years which is extremely important and theyre male
1849550 those are the ones we really want because those are the ones that are going to graft or actually work in a patient
1849551 we just informed them that if they wanted to thered be this opportunity
1849552 hopefully a lot of division i schools will see what coach stoops is doing and then hopefully do it said punter mike knall who also got screened
1849553 if we get all these numbers of people to get their dna out there youre bound to find someone who will meet your match and save thousands or millions of lives
1849554 to save somebodys life its a fairly minimal sacrifice rooms said
1849555 i think as much as anything just the general public doesnt realize maybe how easy it is to be on the registry
1849556 i understand there will be a process if i were to be a donor for it but i think to help someone to improve their life or to give them a chance to live its worth it maybe the little bit of discomfort it might be to give them that chance
1849557 theres a lot of kids who need bone marrow transplants and its just an opportunity for us to add to the possibilities that theyll find a match and that theyll be able to get the transplant that they need bradford said
1849558 a lot of these kids need it to help them live so its just something that we can do to help people out
1849559 the look of the course is pretty much the same
1849560 obviously the rough is thicker they have added some good length bunkers are a little bit deeper
1849561 i had had a bit more to drink than ive had right now
1849562 only probably on the 18th green where i stopped sort of preparing for this weeks tournament and i just said to my caddie do you remember that putt that sergio holed there
1849563 if they dont its their own damned fault for not having it because they really took it to us said rich beem the 2002 pga champion who wasnt a member of the u s team in 2004
1849564 im tired mediate said wednesday after talking for a while about his hectic life since becoming such a celebrity following the 19 hole playoff loss to the worlds no
1849565 i played last july in the british open qualifier here and the golf course is right in front of you the greens are difficult but they are still right in front of you i remember them all
1849566 its not rocket science its just youve got to be under these holes you cannot play them from over the greens theres no tricks obviously just a lot of long clubs for me and i enjoy hitting them
1849567 walking to dinner last night one guy stopped the car on the street sent his son over
1849568 it was kind of freaky actually it was fine there wasnt much going on it wasnt a busy street
1849569 its one of the classic clubs in this country and if you walk up on a point on the upper course you can see the manhattan skyline joe steranka the ceo of the pga of america said wednesday
1849570 so being in the new york metropolitan area for us was important to be able to be near the birthplace i know well have a lot of activities in the year leading up to that centennial championship
1849571 that championship brought a whole group of people into the field and was one of the most dramatic moments steranka said
1849572 well try to finish it on sunday this year though
1849573 she more worried about the schedule than i am campbell said
1849574 i dont see one single positive that tiger woods isnt on our team azinger said
1849575 i cant imagine how you can argue a team would be better off without arguably the greatest player potentially the greatest player who has ever lived as far as im concerned it really puts europe in an advantageous place it puts europe in a favorite role theres just no question about it
1849576 his buddy got the jumper cables and hooked him up to a giant battery for his semi then fired up the engine he probably had to put down his beer first to put the clamps on each side of the snake bite
1849577 the guy is screaming yelling and seizing from this treatment they thought it would somehow break the venom down

1849633 i always knew i could play quarterback but i was always too big my coaches were always like youre an offensive lineman really it was just my weight i was a fat kid and fat kids dont play quarterback take that dad i always told you i could play quarterback
1849634 i mean he can throw the ball 75 yards easy and on top of that he can catch the snap when we go into the shotgun formation that was the real clincher everyone thinks taking a snap is so easy but just look at the footage of us in the last couple games plastered all over espn obviously it isnt
1849635 and its especially intimidating when shes trash to you in broken english and shes not afraid to play dirty either see these scratches all over my arms yeah shes a tough girl
1849636 i just wish my great great great great great great great grandfather was alive for this he could have been known for something other than being some explorer that 4 th graders learn about for less than 10 minutes

1849646 hes never released any medical records just a one page letter from his doctor does it bother anyone that a guy with political ambitions for his entire adult life has not left a paper trail
1849647 hes been on the campaign trail senator obama has a clean bill of health as this letter shows with no surgery or hospital stays this is a complete summary of his doctor visits and medical records for the past two decades
1849648 i do believe that the electorate is entitled to full disclosure of a presidential candidates health information
1849649 its likely that there will be requests for more medical information once he is the nominee
1849650 thats just become much more common and its very difficult for candidates to avoid
1849651 it is a shortsighted decision that doesnt benefit a presidential campaign in any way
1849652 it leaves a voter with the impression that a candidate is hiding something about his health and it allows the opponent to raise questions about it there is no downside that i see for allowing an objective group of reporters to review the complete health record unless there is something the campaign doesnt want known

1849657 jika cinta tidak dapat mengembalikan engkau kepadaku dalam kehidupan ini pastilah cinta akan menyatukan kita dalam kehidupan yang akan datang
1849658 apa yang telah kucintai laksana seorang anak kini tak henti hentinya aku mencintai dan apa yang kucintai kini akan kucintai sampai akhir hidupku karena cinta ialah semua yang dapat kucapai dan tak ada yang akan mencabut diriku dari padanya

1849688 it could eventually offer patients who have had transplant surgery a much higher quality of life free from complex drug regimes
1849689 our research clearly shows that infusing taics into patients before they have a kidney transplant or after the procedure has been carried out is a practical and safe clinical option
1849690 although this procedure is still being developed and refined it poses an exciting possibility for clinicians and patients alike
1849691 this is interesting work which has the potential to both reduce the risk of rejection after organ transplantation and the amount of anti rejection drugs that are required both of which will be good news for patients
1849692 as the authors say this is still early and preliminary work and further development and refinement of the process is required but this procedure does seem to have potential

1849721 lastoria di una certa ragazza mi fa ancora male non trovo quello che cerco e quello che cerco ormai non pu pi essere lei
1849722 sai bene che quando lamore si spegne pi freddo della morte il problema che le due parti in causa non si spengono contemporaneamente e quando sei la parte ancora accesa preferiresti essere morto
1849723 quella volta mi sono divertito come non mai sdraiati sulla sabbia sguazzando in acqua giocando a palla cercando di farlo tra le fratte seduto su una roccia a guardarla giocare tra le onde non so come abbia fatto a ignorare allora che lei era la cosa migliore che avrei mai avuto
1849724 pensai ad una certa ragazza al suo modo di essere a lei non piacevno le feste preferiva andare in un posto tranquillo dove si potesse parlare mi guardai intotno e vidi tutta quella gente con cui avevo diviso la gran parte della mia esistenza e di colpo mi sentii ai confinidella realt
1849725 prima che sar trascorso un secondo sarai morto cenomila volte dice un versetto dl corano e io ho dovuto viverlo
1849726 il mio un amore soprannaturale un peccato senza dio una nuova marca di margarina visto che chi dovrei uccidere sono io uccido lamore visto che sono lincendiaro linnominabile nomino lui visto che non ho potuto dire a lei quanto la amo lo dico al mondo
1849727 a volte penso di non amare pi una certa ragazza che quellamore sia morto ma ogni notte alle prime luci dellalba piccole creature voraci mi succhiano il cuore dato che non c verso di contaminare il suo ricordo il suo ricordo contamina me questo lassiome quando si in due c sempre uno che impesta laltro uno vorrebbe che le persone fossero come simmagina che sia trasformiamo le persone in personaggi che devono agire come vogliamo noi e quello che ho cercato di fare con una certa ragazza per anni ho creduto di avere il controllo e le bastato un istante per lasciarmi basito lasua vta ha svoltato in una direzione inattesa e la mia andata in pezzi le persone scendono dallautobus e corrono verso casa perch hanno urgentemente bisogno del bagno le persone sanno che possono resistere quei duecento metri e lo fanno suonano violentemente alla porta e devono farsela addosso perch nessuno apre perch chi doveva essere in casa non c e questo le persone non lavevano previsto perch tu te la faccia addosso allamore basta un sospiro
1849728 mi piace adare a correre tutte le mattine perch mitiga la tristezza quando sogno una certa ragazza lo so anche se non lo ricordo me lo dice la sensazione di vuoto nel petto correre aiuta per questo al mattino presto c tanta gente che corre
1849729 voglio uccidere questamore perch inutile perche non pu toccarla ne far si che la sua vita abbia nostalgia della mia non importa quanto mi sia lontana o vicina la magia finita se fosse qui sarebbe ancora ermetica ed estranea come una tomba senza nome lamore chiuso a chiave un amore cos pi criminale e feroce di un amore morto
1849730 quando pizzichi una corda di chitarra questa continua a vibrare per un certo tempo e poi vibra il silenzio ed difficile sapere quando smette di vibrare il silenzio a volte credo che una cercta ragazza abbia smesso di vibrare ma pi mi allontano pi il silenzio forte
1849731 noi due abbiamo avuto dei buoni momenti abbiamo avuto dialogo e sogni abbiamo avuto citazini e canzoni abbiamo avuto sesso con amore sesso con magia sesso con sangue e follia forse voglio negare quel tempo ma sar qui a ricordare che le ho insegnato a muovere le stelle a leggere scrittori con i controcazzi a capire ci che i nostri occhi non vedono ci che non si sente le crature delloscurit

1849733 we are working on xbox 360 with microsoft but i dont know beyond that
1849734 moving in a direction where a much more casual gamer can come and pick up your game and wave a wand at a screen rather than learning ten different buttons to play halo with the current xbox 360 controller thats really exciting and i think thats a very positive trend for the industry
1849735 babes sports gadgets fantasies whatever fits the lifestyle interests of todays young adult male
1849736 that is the perfect time to release this game well next to perfect i think perfect would have been day and date with the console releases but november 18 is shortly before thanksgiving this year which is the busiest season for video game sales shipping just before the holiday season is definitely the right thing to do
1849737 one of the big draws for pc gaming is multiplayer so if they can create a unique pc oriented multiplayer experience it could pull more people in if its something substantially different and its great it could even convince some of the people who bought the console version to buy the pc version just for the multiplayer well see
1849738 i doubt that the pc version will sell as well as the xbox360 or ps3 versions for one because the two console versions will have already been out for quite a long time so the people who wanted to play gta iv may have already bought it on one of those consoles secondarily pc games just arent selling as well as console games so the numbers will very likely not be near the console sales
1849739 gaming on pcs is thriving for massively multiplayer online games and is in a death spiral for other games
1849740 the pc gaming market still has its hits here and there
1849741 i think that its death has been vastly exaggerated that said the kinds of games people are playing on the pc are a lot different mmos like world of warcraft casual online games games etc it is hard to sell most console style games on the pc that is certain

1849746 if upstream emissions from heat and electricity are included emissions from buildings total 40 of global emissions and up to 80 of total greenhouse gas emissions in our cities and towns the building sector provides more potential for quick deep and cost effective greenhouse gas mitigation than any other industry
1849747 an integrated eets will improve the energy efficiency of the vast majority 98 of building stock existing buildings which hold the lowest cost abatement opportunities in the world
1849748 high value carbon credits of aud 34 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent tco2 e could realistically achieve a carbon zero position in commercial office buildings at nil cost and based on the mckinsey cost curves energy efficiency in buildings represents an estimated cost negative abatement of us 45 billion to the united states economy and 5 2 billion to the australian economy
1849749 a project only qualifies if it can prove that the emissions reduction would not have occurred without the project in its strictest sense this means that the project must not have been financially feasible without carbon credits
1849750 at the moment a number of projects regarding energy efficiency in buildings such as those that introduce solar power more efficient lighting devices hvac systems and cooking devices such as stoves in rural areas that require less biomass in their operation are eligible for the flexible instruments of the kyoto protocol particularly under the cdm these projects are however still rather few in number and limited to active solutions such as pv cells or other technological options passive solutions such as the design of better oriented and ventilated buildings are not yet applicable under the instruments of the kyoto protocol

1849839 for hundreds of thousands of years clays have been used for wound healing and even gastrointestinal problems
1849840 and there are a lot of people out there who already use mud therapeutically without really knowing how its working
1849841 and now were seeing effectiveness in the lab from a microbiological standpoint
1849842 so now the question is how can this translate into something practical
1849843 the big deal with mrsa is that it starts out as a topical infection but once it gets into the bloodstream you get into a huge problem
1849844 so while were certainly not proposing to inject this directly into the bloodstream were hoping to stop that skin to blood transition from happening
1849845 you can move over just 100 yards from a geological site and the mineralogical makeup of the new site can be completely different
1849846 we see that all the time with different batches of clay or we even sometimes see as with two clays from france that we looked at two clays where both are the same on the mineralogical and chemical level but one kills bacteria and the other doesnt so we have a lot to figure out
1849847 the effort to identify a new class of antibiotics is important because most of the varieties we now use have been around for the last 40 years
1849848 however typically when people look for new naturally derived antibiotics they focus on living biological material like plants so this is an interesting idea in the sense that here theyre looking instead at an inorganic source like mud
1849849 but i would say that in the short term the most likely application will most be for the topical treatment of skin infections rather than as an ingestible

1849893 at least some of what was done was to download the information take the cards and the pin numbers and passwords and then use them to download money from the atm essentially making it into a piggy bank

1849895 a lot of companies dont have competent people that understand data security
1849896 there is no such thing as 100 security but that doesnt mean we should throw up our hand and say whats the use we can get a long way by applying the appropriate technologies

1849908 this is the use of violence to support a particular political agenda this is not activism
1849909 my opinion on animal research is completely unimportant to whats going on right here

1849911 i absolutely do not condone any testing on animals for any sort of cosmetics or anything like that but having that stance i also dont believe that the house should be bombed or that laboratories should be bombed or any sort of violence should happen
1849912 the main thing i want to get across is that i and the community dont consider this protest we consider this terrorism
1849913 the attacks on member of the academic community that occurred this past weekend in santa cruz are outrageous and abhorrent
1849914 acts of violence and intimidation such as these are unacceptable and they continue a troubling pattern seen at ucla and other uc campuses that should be repugnant to us all
1849915 these acts threaten not only our academic researchers and their families but the safety and security of neighbors in our communities as well
1849916 we understand what theyre doing and we predict there will be more of it as long as people continue to hurt animals

1849921 theres a virtually symbiotic relationship between cars and fashion thats why mercedes benz employs both auto designers and fashion designers in its design centres to develop an integrated concept for each car model from its outer moulding and interior design to the selection of materials and suitable accessories
1849922 mercedes benz is the premium auto brand most strongly associated with fashion and design
1849923 the glk rounds off our tremendously successful suv family transferring characteristic mercedes qualities such as refinement dynamism and safety to a compact format in the process this has now significantly raised the bar in this market segment

1849935 martyrdom names and approach to knowledge and a way of life more generally which assumes that the truth of christ cannot somehow be secured but is rather a gift received and lived out in vulnerable yet hopeful giving in return on such a reading the martyr is not one who dies for or because of her beliefs rather the death of the martyr is in some meaningful way the very expression of belief itself martyrdom does not arise out of a feeling of control over death rather it is but an expression of a way of life that gives up the assumption of being in control
1849936 peace is itself and agonistic reality it does not name a settled territory that we can fully embody or own it is not something we own as a first instance called knowledge which then informs our actions rather it is a gift that might be given through us only when we no longer seek violently to control it
1849937 the knowledge of the martyrs is not preoccupied with epistemic justification but is shaped by the epistemological virtues of patience and hope it is an agonistic mode of knowledge that proceeds in fragments and ad hoc alliances not the development of large scale totalities this knowledge resists closure refusing the lie of the total perspective and the search for a purified idiom of speech recognizing that language about god is finally not limited to our current vocabularies
1849938 if you truly love somebody then dont feel sad if you fail to be with the person in the journey of life on earth because its included in all the promises that i make to you that you shall be with the person in the lifeafter

1849962 now we are checking the receivability of every set in the home and recording the channels and networks which are receivable
1849963 this has led to some declines in coverage for some of the networks we are still working to understand the changes and will be updating clients on our progress
