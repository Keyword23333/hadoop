6740001 like his parents before him iddar was born a slave a status ascribed to him at birth and grew up under the total control of a master who exacted labour from him for no remuneration
6740002 in my view iddars case is a clear case of slavery
6740003 the difficulty of constructing a case for iddar demonstrates the need for a law criminalising slavery in mali

6740007 imagine the impact of having the first secretary of education who is also the parent of a lesbian gay bisexual or transgender school aged child
6740008 in the wake of the tragic murder of lawrence king and surveys showing that lgbt young people are far more likely than their heterosexual peers to drop out of or not excel in school having a prominent national advocate who understands the importance of setting safe schools goals could make all the difference in the world

6740014 the nuclear side of the unit will not be affected by the controlled shutdown and will be kept safe at all times
6740015 the shutdown of koeberg unit 1 will increase the strain on the national power grid and in particular the western cape
6740016 we will use the two open cycle gas turbine power stations in the western cape to ensure continuity of electricity supply during this period and to alleviate the strain in the national grid resulting from the shutdown

6740020 russian general vyacheslav borisov told me that the russians will leave gori today by 17 00 and that by 20 00 they will be in java in south ossetia
6740021 i can confirm that the russians have already abolished two checkpoints in gori and that 13 russian armoured vehicles have left the city
6740022 we will listen to him but of course its not russia that must decide these things unilaterally we have a framework in the six point plan and the future developments are subject to further diplomatic efforts

6740034 we may not have as deep a pocket as some of the multibillion dollar corporations we compete with theyre very good competitors but that doesnt mean we cant out think them thats where engauge comes into play

6740051 its a really good game and a great new initiative that should bring hurling to an even wider audience
6740052 i dont think the people of waterford need me to remind them of how important hurling is in this county so i expect the upcoming event to be the most successful tournament in the country guinness hurling cubed is a real positive for hurling and i think its a great opportunity for a group of friends or teammates to get a team together and have a go and have a bit of fun at the same time
6740053 the guinness hurling cubed final is on in dublin the night before the all ireland final in september and the winners will get a vip trip to all ireland and a 1 000 each which is a super prize
6740054 i can confirm that on thursday 14 august police had reason to attend the allen ramsay hotel in carlops
6740055 as a result a 49 year old man was cautioned and charged with a contravention of the licensing scotland act 1976 and a report has been sent to the procurator fiscal
6740056 over the years we have dealt with karls father tony in relation to the business and it was only when karl took charge a number of months ago that we encountered difficulties
6740057 the last number of months has upset my wife and family greatly and we decided that enough was enough
6740058 we had a private family party to mark the end of our time at the hotel and the police were called due to a noise complaint from the residents above
6740059 this whole affair has left a very bad taste after what was a happy time running the hotel
6740060 i would take the hotel over tomorrow but i cannot contact the owner its the hub of the community and has bags of potential
6740061 if given the chance i feel that we could make a success of it
6740062 the allen ramsay is the centre of our community and everyone in the village hopes that it will open its doors again soon

6740073 tuve una operaci n muy complicada y casi me voy del otro lado ah me di cuenta de que era perecedera y busqu un sentido para mi vida
6740074 soy cat lica en el sentido de universal amo a jes s pero tambi n a los grandes que vinieron a este mundo a hacer algo como buda y zoroastro o contempor neos como ghandi y teresa de calcuta
6740075 a m me parece hermoso que me llamen as porque ella amaba a los pobres pero tengo poco que ver con teresa en el sentido de que pertenec a a un grupo religioso determinado
6740076 yo les critico a algunas iglesias que en ocasiones no viven lo que predican porque si as lo hicieran todos estar amos muy unidos
6740077 cuando tengo que construir una escuela o un hospital muchas veces no hay nada entonces me pongo a buscar y cuando la gente se entera empieza a mandar dinero y materiales creo que es porque dios quiere que sea as pero cuando no me llega nada no me enojo con l trato de hacer las cosas igual
6740078 lo importante es tener ganas de mejorar la vida de los otros uno puede hacer muchas cosas acercarse a un hospital para hablar con un enfermo o donar la ropa y los alimentos que tiene de m s si uno se propone dar tiene de sobra aunque posea poco
6740079 pienso que no hay que fijarse en lo que hacen los otros el gobierno las iglesias cada uno debe tomar la iniciativa y decir hoy empiezo y despu s es probable que se le sumen otras personas
6740080 nosotros no recibimos sueldos ni los pagamos no manejamos dinero porque todo lo que recibimos son alimentos y materiales que distribuimos o utilizamos en las construcciones

6740083 theres three camper vans and one car that ive noticed parked there for a number of weeks its like a forecourt and ive seen one individual who is clearly living out of one of the camper vans its ridiculous
6740084 the long term parking of vehicles for sale there is a real problem we have by laws regarding this car park and these owners are in direct contravention of them
6740085 there is a by law in place which states that it is illegal to sell cars in a public car park and there is also a traffic regulation order that covers kingsmeadow car park which states that the car park should not be used for trading overnight use or untaxed vehicles
6740086 unison are meeting tomorrow friday in glasgow and we will devise any future strategy from this we hope that cosla will now come back to the table with a decent offer
6740087 if they dont then we will have no option but to strike again no union member wishes to cause disruption but it is our last resort
6740088 the 2 5 per cent offer is derisory as inflation is expected to rise dramatically in the coming years also being tied to a 3 year offer is unacceptable for the same reason as no one knows how the economy will perform during that period
6740089 taking the decision to close any post office branch is always very difficult and we know will cause concern to many of our customers
6740090 we want to ensure that everyone who uses relies on or has any concern with post office services is both fully aware of the proposed changes and able to give views on them
6740091 for a year i have had meetings with the royal mail and scottish borders council to prevent the kind of closure programme the highlands has seen and while happy that we are not seeing such widespread closures proposed any reduction in service will be resisted
6740092 i am hoping that as many local people as possible will respond to the consultation with their views and i will be in touch with local residents
6740093 there needs to be a guarantee from royal mail that there will be no break in service but the fact that were going to have a replacement service is a certain comfort
6740094 people will still be able to collect their pensions and use the same services

6740101 during initial site surveys on the talla reservoir upgrade we found a swallow nest located in one of the tower shafts scottish water takes advice from a number of organisations in preparation for such projects protecting the natural environment and ecosystems is an important part of what we do
6740102 we would like to take this opportunity to thank the local community for their co operation and patience while we wait on these young chicks growing up and migrating with the rest of the swallow population
6740103 swallows are a classic signifier of summer in the british isles and their presence is enjoyed by so many people as they whizz through the sky and collect insects to feed their young
6740104 they have a strong bond and association with man using our buildings as the perfect place safe from predators to build their nests so it is great to see them being appreciated in this way
6740105 we have worked very closely with scottish borders councils social work department on what is required from these apartments

6740153 i noticed them whilst out walking earlier in the week and spotted four caravans parked in the area
6740154 theyve never been here before ive spoken to a lot of neighbours and the feeling is that everyone is quite concerned about having travellers pitching up in caravans so close to our homes
6740155 i have contacted scottish borders council and the police about the matter and lots of other residents are doing the same
6740156 it there is not a designated place laid aside for them in a town then they shouldnt stay there
6740157 its unfair on local residents for them to pitch up wherever they like this is also the middle of our tourist season and many people come here in the summer and stay in caravan parks travellers seem to want carte blanche to do whatever they like

6740163 under the new pension credit scheme the department for work and pensions dwp admits that low earners will see their retirement income increased by only 1 per cent of their salary or 2 a week after 10 years saving in the governments flagship new pension scheme to be launched in 2012 because their savings are eaten away by means testing even someone earning 25 000 a year who contributes to the new personal accounts for 20 years will only see their income in retirement increased from 31 per cent of salary to 34 per cent experts say the figures highlight the way pension credit the means tested benefit paid to pensioners with small pensions reduces the incentive for many people to save
6740164 the imaginary time bomb why an ageing population is not a social problem
6740165 historically modern societies double their wealth about every twenty five years this kind of growth projected across the next half century would dwarf the extra pension and other costs to society of more elderly dependents moreover it is far from certain that extra years of life mean extra years of ill health and dependency serious disease tends to be concentrated towards the end of life so living longer may simply postpone the point of onset without increasing the costs

6740168 people within the party recognise that until the stability of the assembly is more firmly established on a longer term basis there will be reluctance among people who are westminster mps to give up their seats to work exclusively in the assembly there will be a phasing in of that approach
6740169 we have a choice as a people either you continue with the division or you seek to end it my party took the position that in the right circumstances it was possible to proceed but that we couldnt concede to terror criminal activities had to end guns had to be handed over and there had be support for the police the courts and the rule of law
6740170 while political parties in ni would have wide areas where they can agree if you put the conservative party and the labour party into the same room you would have battles every day on issues of socio economic policy
6740171 the differences we have we are talking about and attempting to reach agreement on there are battles but they are ending without blood being spilt and that perhaps is the difference between now and the past
6740172 atheist leaders will not be tempted to think they are the messenger of any good news from above or the agent of any higher purpose on earth or at very least they will not think this literally

6740174 suicide bombing is not just a religious phenomenon it is employed by many secular organisations including the kurdish pkk and the marxist tamil tigers
6740175 ariel merari a tel aviv university psychologist has profiled 50 suicide bombers and found that there were hardly any common factors none were deranged or schizophrenic few had problems like depression merari concluded that the only factor linking all forms of suicide terrorism was the way bombers were recruited and trained it is the psychology of the group not the individual that is key
6740176 there are serious flaws in the nss and the approach it embodies but it is a document which offers all things to all readers while being strangely unable to provide much in the way of vision leadership and motivation or strategy in other words the nss refers to the uks core values human rights the rule of law legitimate and accountable government justice freedom tolerance and opportunity for all but these values are mentioned in a strangely passive and defensive way almost as if the most that should be done with these immense ideas is to protect them from marauding terrorists and criminals and of course to stop them being ruined by flood water saddest of all these values appear to constitute little more than the normality to which we are told the governments security strategy will enable us to return as soon as possible after some harm occurs
6740177 so far 200 projects in 70 towns and cities have been funded by whitehall in the attempt to develop the capacity of communities particularly involving muslim women to challenge and resist violent extremists

6740179 counter terrorism police disrupt 13 terror networks last year from april 2007 until march 2008 over 40 people were convicted of terrorist related offences as a result of metropolitan police investigations and sentences amounting to more than 600 years were imposed the police arrested 46 people in relation to terrorist investigations between the start of this year and may 31 and charged 10 although the report points out that some of the remainder have been cautioned detained pending an immigration investigation or dealt with under the mental health act
6740180 it is extremely difficult for the nationalist tradition to separate out what i might call peacetime britishness from unionist triumphalism just as many unionists find it difficult to separate irish patriotism from at least implied support for the ira i know this sounds piously balanced but i believe it to be the case

6740182 i hope that all committee members will be able to support the civic reception and that t hose who feel they are unable to vote for will at least not vote against the worst thing for the city will be if this issue becomes a political football with the resulting bad feeling that will be generated
6740183 the milieu of terrorists is invariably morally squalid when it is not merely criminal
6740184 the data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and islamic fundamentalism or any religion for that matter in fact the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the tamil tigers in sri lanka a marxist leninist group whose members are from hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents
6740185 liberal democracies may be able to resist muslim terrorism but the greatest long running threat to secularism democracy and science could come from within from the emerging coalition of the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing for open society that they share with each other and with osama bin laden
6740186 bombs threaten life and property as would more harmful devices not yet found in the possession of terrorists but that they might conceivably obtain
6740187 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services

6740379 the ministry will do all it can to support cocobod improve upon its facilities practices and performance for the benefit of the farmer and other stakeholders in the industry

6740382 take the case of nigeria since the current oil boom started in 2004 its economic performance has been far better than in previous booms in 1974 78 1979 83 and 1990 94 measuring non oil growth or inflation during 2005 06 it received paris club debt relief and bought back much of the remainder of its external debt since then trade in nigeria debt has been mainly in domestic issues nigeria debt trading is ranked 21st globally at the end of 2007
6740383 our operations department in japan managed to deliver the 80gb ps3 a week earlier than was originally anticipated in order to maximise the bank holiday weekend

6740385 similarly many of our upcoming blu ray releases feature dlc and with the importance of such content increasing with the releases of games such as littlebigplanet we wanted to give consumers more hard drive space
6740386 beckhams story is a modern day fairytale of heroes villains love and what it means to lead your country
6740387 specific language and images appropriate for same sex wedding ceremonies or civil unions
6740388 these new wedding cards were created in direct response to consumers desires to have cards that include specifically tailored language and images for same sex marriages or civil unions
6740389 it is our goal to be inclusive rather than exclusive so that our products appeal to the widest range of people who wish to communicate and connect with one another
6740390 the first aspect of my speech is what most of us are here gathered is this country fair to niger delta people
6740391 the same laws there is another law that is called the exclusive economic zone act it is structured in the same way for which you have to get licenses to be able to exploit natural resources including oil
6740392 the land use act is the worse even though i am a beneficiary as a trustee as a governor but it should not be so our people should be allowed to own their land and they sell it as much as they want land is capital
6740393 let me take you to the most important aspect to me
6740394 the first thing to say is that in baghad you know what the war is about dont you it is a religious war between the shiites and the sunnis in rivers state in bayelsa and other parts of the niger delta who is fighting who what is the war about what is the shooting about
6740395 the way to define criminality is that anybody who breaks the laws of the federal republic of nigeria is a criminal
6740396 the struggle for now because it does not exist because a struggle is ideological and there is no ideological bent to the struggle we are seeing
6740397 the first principle is self survival if nigeria has rejected me should i reject myself
6740398 we ask ourselves one basic question what are we voted here to do what is our responsibility
6740399 but the truth is that when it militancy started nobody thought it will get to this point
6740400 we must demand from our leaders accountability they must account not for the funds alone they must account for what they have turned our children into they must tell us why the next mans life is not as important as their own life they must when they started it it was just simple local government area matter chairman of council that they were struggling for and to publicly say that we have won an election today those local governments are not even in their hands anymore today they cannot go home today governors are demanding for more security in their convoys today legislators are demanding for more security from their governors today commissioners are demanding for security
6740401 and people now accuse me of not being as accessible as i used to be when i was a speaker but they dont know i am saving them because i could come if i want to come no matter how tough it is with enough security to escort me to your house and i will sit and drink when i go i go with the same armed men you are left alone to the mercy of god and if you are not a good christian you are not praying well then too bad
6740402 but i cannot back a criminal entity where people sit down and kidnap and do oil bunkering to the detriment of our economy and you say we will negotiate i am not part of the negotiation i have said to the world until we enforce the law to make it difficult for these criminals to know that they cannot kidnap anybody and get away with it the kidnapping will continue
6740403 i have said to everybody that want to listen that what we are dealing with is poverty and unemployment these boys are poor these boys are poor and unemployed and no matter how much employment you bring today they are not willing to participate in any employment
6740404 when i was a speaker before i became governor i used to see some of them they tell me these are the people who are into this shooting and when they come they carry young girls they wear these jeans half of their buttocks and they come with jeeps and imagine if n250 000 can buy them jeeps
6740405 then we the governors at that point we have a responsibility
6740406 as a governor i have plans of what i want to do but as i am talking to you i cannot execute those things because i have security threats
6740407 but we cannot move anywhere even though contractors have been paid to do the jobs
6740408 the governor is entitled to the way he perceives us if fighting for our rights means we have to go against the law of a country that is criminal by injustice it has meted on the niger delta people the we are proud to be branded as outlaws the sword and the pen seem to be the only language our government understands
6740409 the local and international media know a genuine struggle from criminality respected media houses will not report criminality on a regular basis how many armed robbery occurrence in lagos has been reported on cnn
6740410 whether he likes it or not rotimi amaechi rode on the shoulders of governor peter odili to become the current governor of rivers state we believe that it was his destiny to become governor of rivers state even if his tenure may some day be cut short
6740411 we have a lot to gain from approaching our problem through dialogue we have a lot to lose if our youth continue to use gun and kidnapping to harass people out of the niger delta
6740412 every reasonable nigerian should be concerned about the pitiable condition of our brothers and sisters in the niger delta their situation calls for concern successive government leaderships have not been fair to them
6740413 kidnapping sons daughters and relations of prominent indigenes and residents of the area and compelling them to pay ransom means that the war is being fought against the people it should not be so
6740414 we dont have to pretend that all is well with the way few things are happening in the niger delta some people are feeling the way amaechi is feeling but they cant say it perhaps because they are afraid
6740415 n o foi dessa vez tivemos muita for a e garra ningu m mais do que eu queria este ouro
6740416 kareena is a style icon for todays youth the decision to select kareena as our brand ambassador was apt because it fetched the brand globus an international recognition
6740417 globus has come up with some international new collections and we know that kareena as our brand ambassador is just right to showcase them
6740418 the french artiste is going to create a new look for kareena and believe me she is going to look simply stunning so stunning that it is going to turn bollywood actresses green
6740419 no films with top stars if i have nothing to do in them
6740420 eww thats nasty i have never ever hooked up with micahel phelps
6740421 come on i have really good taste hes really not my type
6740422 it always makes me laugh when people say is she isnt she its like eventually you will know so just chill out for a minute
6740423 every single version of the bill was neutral on roe each one affected only babies already born not ones in the womb
6740424 essentially adding an additional doctor who then has to be called in an emergency situation to come in and make these assessments is really designed simply to burden the original decision of the woman and the physician to induce labor and perform an abortion
6740425 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
6740426 on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views
6740427 reduce inequality eliminate discrimination promote and protect human rights of individuals and strengthen good relationships between nigerians and host countries
6740428 in order to bring about effective change the commission will use its vast knowledge influence and authority to ensure that nigerians travelling residing and making a living in a foreign land receive extended protection the same way the united states the united kingdom and most developed countries protect their citizens when situations arise
6740429 the organisation would also assist those finding themselves in difficulties due to misfortune such as long illness breakdown of relationship bereavement or any other unforeseen circumstances that have made them jobless and homeless
6740430 i think the city of valencia should be extremely proud of this circuit streets circuits are particularly challenging to manage and it has no doubt taken an impressively complex amount of logistical coordination to put this race together every new circuit experiences a few teething problems but this track has every potential to be a highlight on the formula one calendar the organisers have managed to construct an excellent track and paddock in a fabulous location and we are pleased to be celebrating our 200th grand prix here
6740431 it was very exciting to see the formula one cars take to the track for the first time ever this morning of course bridgestone and the teams have all tried to prepare in advance and have done numerous simulations but it is not until you actually run that you begin to fully understand a track from bridgestones perspective we sent a team of technical staff to valencia on no fewer than three occasions before this weekend so we had a pretty good idea what to expect from the track in terms of its layout the surface characteristics and how these may affect our tyres safety is always of primary concern to bridgestone so it is standard procedure for us to raise in advance any precautionary concerns about a track but we are pleased to see that judging from this mornings running the drivers all managed to gain a significant amount of track time without any particular problems for the tyres it looks like we will have a thrilling race this sunday
6740432 it is incredible to think that it has been 12 years since we first entered formula one the time has gone so quickly but we are very proud to be celebrating our 200th race in valencia it is a great tribute to everyone involved especially our technical and tyre servicing team that we have achieved such a professional and successful record in the sport
6740433 formula one is not only the pinnacle of single seater motorsport but also one of the most watched sports in the world and so it made sense to be involved at the time our brand awareness and market share was very high in some markets including our home market of japan but unfortunately it was less so in other markets europe for example entering formula one has had a significant contribution to increasing our brand awareness and we are now known across the globe
6740434 since entering formula one and competing successfully against rival tyre manufacturers our brand awareness in many key markets across the globe has increased significantly furthermore large numbers of consumers have seen and recognised our companys technical capabilities and the quality of our products we have also been able to recruit high calibre staff and develop strong relationships with many of the worlds leading car manufacturers
6740435 formula one is very professional and that is reflected in the huge television broadcasting figures it achieves with so many people watching it on television our exposure is quite significant
6740436 yes we have competed against two tyre manufacturers during our time in formula one goodyear and michelin and each of those periods contributed to some very exciting racing
6740437 each tyre manufacturer has its own ideas and philosophies and we have respected this and enjoyed and relished the tough fights we have had with them those were very good times for us now of course it is a very different situation but nevertheless we are enjoying working with all the teams
6740438 it wasnt easy and we worked extremely hard but it has to be said that seeing our tyres on formula one cars at our first race in australia in 1997 was a special memory
6740439 its high time the police stopped sweeping organized crime under the carpet as nigerians need to know the real motive of killing ogundeji and past others
6740440 the antecedents of the police in resolving high profile assassinations are unimpressive as nobody has ever been arraigned in law court over these past killings
6740441 as soon as the tribunals conclude inec will commence prosecution in earnest in some places where the cases are over we have started prosecution in magistrate courts and we have set up a committee to handle that and i believe they are equal to the task
6740442 after our interactions then we will forward our findings to the national assembly in doing this we would have taken reviews from zone to zone and to share experiences from the zones
6740443 for the sake of sanitizing our polity the efcc should not stop with the obama scam but should clear the augean stable by prosecuting professor ndi okereke onyiuke and her cohorts for corrupting the nigerian electoral system through a nebulous association called corporate nigeria
6740444 u s and iraqi negotiators have now also agreed to a conditions based withdrawal of u s combat troops by the end of 2011 a date further in the future than the iraqis initially wanted the deal would leave tens of thousands of troops in supporting roles such as military trainers for an
6740445 the republican candidate sen ariz has said he will continue current policy his democratic opponent sen ill has said he will begin an immediate withdrawal of u s
6740446 if the iraqi government at that time decides it is necessary to keep the american forces longer they can do so
6740447 what my presence can do is to identify any final obstacles
6740448 its a chance for me to sit with the prime minister and really get a sense of if there is anything else we need to do from washington to get to closure
6740449 we are working together as partners to make sure we cover the concerns of both
6740450 oprah has told the editors at o magazine shes tired of being on the cover every month its a pain it takes a lot of time and energy and shes sick of it shes given them six months to figure out what to do without her
6740451 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan
6740452 we wont relax our efforts to support and reconstruct afghanistan because we understand that what happens in afghanistan affects the rest of the world
6740453 we are determined to work with the afghan government and coalition forces to defeat the forces of terrorism
6740454 plotting in the cabinet is not new it happens in afghanistan too but not to me
6740455 we have succeeded in winning back territory the longer term solution is that more power will be given to the afghanistan people
6740456 you are the heroes of our country you are the frontline against the taliban what you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6740457 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success people have been winning medals in areas where we have been breaking ground
6740458 but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication you make our country proud every day of the week every week of the year you are truly the heroes of our country
6740459 i wish to say how proud i am of you today
6740460 morale among the troops is very strong they are gradually extending the area which we control we are also making great progress in training the afghan army the government is determined to stamp out lawlessness
6740461 it shows we do have support for what we are doing

6740465 ecb rate cuts are not fully discounted in the market so the euro has more downside risk
6740466 the medium term trend is still positive for the dollar against the euro and other currencies
6740467 investors dont see any factor solid enough to support yen buying beyond 108 a dollar
6740468 we continue to view recent gains in the u s dollar as sustainable
6740469 i hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war
6740470 the president personally called rohullah nikpai and congratulated him for this achievement
6740471 senior management has been talking with a wide array of possible investors this week

6740474 los acuerdos las normas y las leyes benefician tu bienestar y el de los dem s
6740475 para que un sistema de leyes funcione todos los ciudadanos tenemos que creer en ellas respetarlas estar seguros de que a todos nos sirven de la misma manera y que no hay favoritismos o distinciones en su aplicaci n
6740476 nuestra historia nos ense a que no es suficiente querer ser un pa s de leyes es necesario que con el trabajo y el compromiso de todos ayudemos a que la aplicaci n de leyes sea una realidad
6740477 en el sistema de gobierno mexicano la justicia se refiere a tres cosas 1 que cada persona tenga la seguridad y el respaldo de las leyes y la autoridad para que su familia su cuerpo y su dignidad sean siempre respetadas y protegidas 2 que se persiga y castigue a cualquier persona o autoridad que desobedezca la constituci n o las leyes 3 que todos esos castigos sean definidos por jueces imparciales y justos quienes no pierdan de vista que delincuentes e infractores tambi n son seres humanos con derechos que deben respetarse
6740478 si los diferentes grupos que componen nuestro pa s no se respetan y no se ayudan para tener condiciones de vida digna no alcanzaremos una forma de vida en que todos seamos iguales y libres
6740479 diariamente vivimos situaciones en que no todos los mexicanos somos tratados de igual manera ni en forma justa las diferencias de sexo origen tnico y lengua estado de salud o ingreso son todav a motivos para no dar ni recibir trato de iguales

6740482 when are you guys going to get rid of all that crap in your garage
6740483 well i was taking the trash can out to the curb and she was in her car she rolled down her window and said woo woo if my trash man looked liked that i would and i didnt hear the rest
6740484 yea and then i said that we should have them over for a bbq before summer is over
6740485 and then she said and yes she really said this lets have a nudy party
6740486 no she doesnt maybe she wants to see you naked
6740487 uhhh no she already told me she hates my tits
6740488 its now clear that the economy will be the tipping point in this election
6740489 and the candidate who has the best answer to getting america growing again without inflation is going to tap the winning segment of this electorate
6740490 i like johns ideas but he has more to do in terms of making his case and connecting with voters on the economy
6740491 but has he effectively conveyed those policies in a way that votes will understand thats the challenge for his campaign
6740492 neither obama nor mccain owns the economy as an issue because theyve never focused on it really in ways that working class families would identify with
6740493 obama has always been about hope and change in a broad sense while mccain has always been about foreign policy and experience

6740502 our politics have become so embedded and so partisan with so many special interests that they require a massive effort from the public telling them we want something done
6740503 the prospects of being born in the united states are still better than being born anyplace else in the world
6740504 it has not paid to sell america short since 1776 and the time to start is not in 2008
6740505 he did not commit the offense for which he was convicted
6740506 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the u s where we can do that
6740507 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
6740508 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
6740509 cursed with good looks the ability to enunciate most words and access to the best parties and sociably acceptable drugs tv people really believe theyre smarter than everyone else and essential to maintaining the myth of a true democracy
6740510 what a brilliant business move for the jets whatever he does this year will be an upgrade for the jets at that position
6740511 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6740512 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6740513 yes we refrain from the exercises but it is only a response
6740514 it would be a nice way to end but just to be mentioned in the same sentence as redgrave is fantastic
6740515 i never imagined that 10 years ago when i started out this thing that it would be quite as successful as that
6740516 it would be nice to come to london and better that record and retire a happy man
6740517 the programme is quite difficult really with one race after the other normally in the world championship format we have a day off in between the team pursuit and the madison
6740518 it all got a bit too much really the lack of sleep and being thrust into the media circus out there the lengthy dope controls and things like that it wasnt to be but still when i reflect though to come away with two golds i would have been happy to come back with that at the start of the games
6740519 peaking of world oil production impacts mitigation and risk management
6740520 there is no question in my mind that peaking is going to occur within the next 10 or 15 years so if depletion is as high as some people think it is we are in a very very serious serious problem much worse than the worst that we considered in the past

6740527 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6740528 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6740529 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6740530 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6740531 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6740532 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6740533 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6740534 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6740535 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6740536 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6740537 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6740538 the one is the kingdom of god on earth namely the true church of jesus christ and those who desire from their heart to be united with it the other is the kingdom of satan those who refuse to obey the divine and eternal law and who have many aims of their own in contempt of god and many aims also against god

6740545 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6740546 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6740547 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6740548 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6740549 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6740550 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6740551 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6740552 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6740553 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6740554 he is vacationing in the caribbean and went to a local hospital as a precaution for some discomfort he was feeling due to heartburn and gastroenteritis
6740555 it was definitely not a heart attack he is fine and healthy and enjoying the rest of his vacation travelling in the caribbean
6740556 i think he was just enjoying vacation and probably ate a little too much spicy caribbean food
6740557 the un seasonal rainfall over the last two summers means many people have to use their heating systems to dry clothes and even just to keep warm at times
6740558 there is also the fact that many old people are in need of their heating all year round
6740559 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6740560 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6740561 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6740562 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6740563 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6740564 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6740565 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6740566 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6740567 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6740568 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6740569 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6740570 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6740571 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6740572 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6740573 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6740574 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6740575 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6740576 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6740577 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

6740579 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6740580 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6740581 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6740582 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6740583 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6740584 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6740585 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6740586 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6740587 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6740588 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

6740593 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6740594 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6740595 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6740596 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6740597 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6740598 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6740599 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6740600 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6740601 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6740602 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6740603 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6740604 what the obama campaign has lost sight of i think and what it needs to regain control of is the essential message of his candidacy
6740605 the players have looked at themselves after last week and realised they took the wrong options but as coaches we know its a process and we dont want to go away from that style of play
6740606 we believe thats the way forward but we just need to be more accurate we want to finish more we created a massive amount of scoring opportunities in cape town and we need a bit more patience when it comes to execution
6740607 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

6740625 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6740626 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6740627 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6740628 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

6740691 we will not stop watching over our entire people and no one not even you will be able to take this responsibility from us
6740692 to rejoice over victory by violence is to rejoice over slaughter the wise ruler sees a military triumph as a funeral
6740693 if only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them but the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being and who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart
6740694 there is a principle which is a bar against all information which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance that principle is contempt prior to investigation

6740701 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo

6740704 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6740705 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6740706 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6740707 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6740708 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6740709 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6740719 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6740720 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6740721 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6740722 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6740723 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6740724 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6740725 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6740726 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6740727 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6740728 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6740730 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6740731 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6740732 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6740733 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6740740 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras

6740747 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6740748 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6740749 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6740750 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6740751 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6740752 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6740753 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6740754 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6740755 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6740756 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6740757 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6740758 ao todo ser o us 150 milh es em investimentos

6740763 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6740764 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6740765 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia

6740771 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6740772 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6740773 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

6740783 the killing and rape of civilians in the eastern province of north kivu in the democratic republic of congo continues at a horrifying rate despite the signing of a peace accord six months ago
6740784 it is out of the question to grant amnesty for the sake of peace to people who killed looted and raped
6740785 tomorrow everyone will grab a weapon to kill innocent people knowing theyll be granted an amnesty
6740786 most of the elected representatives from both kivus are also against this amnesty law
6740787 the congolese government does not have a strong army or strong diplomacy and is suffering the consequences of that weakness
6740788 the amnesty law was the only way to put an end to the situation of war and insecurity and seal the reconciliation of people in both provinces
6740789 it is up to judges to say if that was an act of war or a war crime

6740796 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

6740921 major league baseball and the media they want instant replay and were going to have instant replay so if it delays the game then theres nothing we can do about it
6740922 i know they were doing some tests on things that the commissioner and jimmie lee were working on it ive been talking to solomon about other things thats been the furthest thing from my mind
6740923 hopefully they let the pitchers have a few pitches just to make sure theyre loose

6740927 there are too many other things that major league baseball can do to shorten games instant replay is not going to make that big a deal
6740928 its one play a week maybe where its a borderline home run call its not something thats going to slow down that many games

6740948 tenho certeza de que israel vai impedir a nossa entrada na faixa de gaza
6740949 mas acho que do ponto de vista da lei internacional n o tem o direito de faz lo
6740950 eles podem revistar nossos barcos e procurar armas que obviamente n o v o achar mas n o podem nos impedir de entrar na regi o

6740972 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6740973 the recent improvement in the monthly gross lending could offer some encouragement in what are typically slower months lending still remains 27 per cent down on a year ago levels and access to mortgages remains challenging while banks are still in the process of repairing their balance sheets and as the securitisation markets remain effectively closed mortgage lending is unlikely to recover in any meaningful way
6740974 while there was a small month on month increase in activity it represented a notable decline from a year ago this continues the weaker picture seen in june and points towards the more subdued levels of lending we are likely to see in the second half of 2008
6740975 when you have a bunion your big toe moves towards your smaller toes and the bone on the inside of the foot becomes prominent creating the familiar bunion appearance there are many theories as to why this happens such as tight fitting shoes genetic predisposition or the way someone walks and we hope our study will provide a clearer picture
6740976 if you are over 18 have a bunion or think you have a bunion and you havent had any foot surgery you will be able to take part in our study
6740977 it doesnt even matter whether the bunion is painful or not
6740978 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
6740979 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
6740980 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
6740981 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
6740982 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
6740983 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
6740984 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
6740985 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
6740986 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
6740987 if this child doesnt get to a hospital shes not going to make it
6740988 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
6740989 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
6740990 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
6740991 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
6740992 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
6740993 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
6740994 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
6740995 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
6740996 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
6740997 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
6740998 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
6740999 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
6741000 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
6741001 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
6741002 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
6741003 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
6741004 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
6741005 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
6741006 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
6741007 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
6741008 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
6741009 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
6741010 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
6741011 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
6741012 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
6741013 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
6741014 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
6741015 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
6741016 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
6741017 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
6741018 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
6741019 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
6741020 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
6741021 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
6741022 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
6741023 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
6741024 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
6741025 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off
6741026 now that property prices have fallen by 15 this year across nottingham you are almost guaranteed to achieve a rental yield above 8 in prime areas
6741027 they could then enter a formal profit sharing agreement with the child so the profits go to the student taxed at a low or for example a higher rate taxpayer with a 200 000 student property on a net yield of say 5 providing an income of 10 000 a year would save up to 3 087 on that income

6741039 obviously he s somebody who changed the game for players and definitely myself who came in 20 years after he came into the front office
6741040 if you look at what he s done and if you really understand the game and know history and do the research of how it was before gene upshaw it was pretty bad he built on it every year you have strikes and maybe people that have been upset with him in recent years about retired players and how they were being treated but for us players in the game today you have to respect him and understand how much he meant to the game
6741041 i actually had a couple of conversations with him got to know him a little bit he was a great person and i was saddened by that my thoughts go out to his family and his friends it s a sad situation but hopefully his family can recover from that
6741042 i think the guys that work with him closely are really shocked by this news
6741043 we are consuming what is available from others but we need to localize all these technological development by producing our own it is very possible
6741044 in asia they are not relying on english products rather they relate new information technology into their social lives
6741045 people need to stop seeing it as a complex show they think computers are difficult but they use mobile phones everyday though we understand that some people are poor and there is this problem of lack of electricity our confidence is that people are now waking up to the reality gradually people are now localizing it use into our system but the pace is slow

6741049 american officials stressed repeatedly that meeting the timetables depended on the security situation in iraq where sectarian killings and attacks on american troops have declined sharply over the past year from the peak levels in 2006 and 2007
6741050 iraqi officials who have pushed for an even tighter target date for the united states to end its military operations could also end up rejecting the draft agreement
6741051 the deal would leave tens of thousands of u s troops inside iraq in supporting roles such as military trainers for an unspecified time
6741052 the troop pullback has been started at a rate to make sure that the russian troops be within the area of responsibility of the russian peacekeeping contingent by the end of 22 august

6741054 se gripase o que alguna pieza saliese despedida dando al empenaje de cola y eso derivara en un giro del avi n a la derecha que el piloto no pudiera controlar
6741055 lo que dicen las c maras es que no hubo ninguna explosi n durante el despegue

6741057 que se est n dando informaciones amarillas y malintencionadas sobre lo que es llanamente un accidente

6741067 pero el presidente s y parece que en el segundo intento de despegue el piloto apura al m ximo las posibilidades que da la pista y se observa que el avi n no coge la altura que en situaciones de normalidad estamos acostumbrados a ver

6741074 we are living through a period of inflating prices and mortgages are no exception
6741075 the bank of england can cut rates but as we have seen over the past year there is no guarantee this will translate into a lower true cost of mortgages at least in the short term
6741076 with rates creeping steadily upwards the advice to borrowers looking for a new deal is clear look to minimise your exposure to rate rises by ranking your mortgage on the true cost taking into account repayments as well as all fees

6741158 hier wird mit belsten methoden versucht menschen das wort im mund umzudrehen die sp hat den anspruch in der kommission mit gr ter sorgfalt die tats chliche faktenlage zu erfassen
6741159 dagegen brauchen die gr nen im grunde gar keine kommission und keine zeugenaussagen weil sie von beginn an ihre vorgefassten meinungen wiederholen den gr nen geht es nicht um die menschen im ows sondern darum auf kosten von patientinnen und mittlerweile traumatisierten mitarbeiterinnen politisch zu punkten

6741163 seine amateurhaften verhandlungen sorgten daf r dass ein gebrauchter flieger des alten modells tranche 1 nun mehr kostet als ein neuer moderner der tranche 2 zus tzlich hat der rechnungshof festgestellt dass nur zwei der von darabos bestellten 15 eurofighter als tats chlich neuwertig angesehen werden k nnen 13 hingegen als gebraucht eingestuft werden m ssen das ist der bev lkerung wohl schwer zu erkl ren
6741164 zudem hat der rechnungshof best tigt dass es zum zeitpunkt der verhandlungen kein konzept f r die luftraum berwachung mit nunmehr nur 15 eurofightern gegeben hat damit hat darabos seine aufgaben als landesverteidigungsminister glatt verfehlt die milit rische sicherheit ist ihm offensichtlich nicht wichtig
6741165 mit milchm dchenrechnungen kann man nicht argumentieren ein verteidigungsminister hat nicht nur auf kostenreduktion zu schielen sondern die erf llung seiner milit rischen aufgaben vor augen zu haben
6741166 man stelle sich vor darabos hat die reduktion auf 15 gro teils gebrauchte alte flieger im alleingang ausverhandelt ohne das finanzministerium oder die zust ndigen dienststellen im eigenen ministerium zu informieren oder einzubinden und f r diese neue st ckzahl ein taktisches einsatzkonzept vorbereitet zu haben damit hat der verteidigungsminister nicht nur die sicherheit sterreichs sondern auch jene der ihm anvertrauten piloten gef hrdet
6741167 sogar der chef des generalstabes weigerte sich daraufhin die erforderlichen ver nderungen einzuleiten
6741168 aus seinen gro en ank ndigungen n mlich aus den bestehende eurofightervertr gen noch mehr herauszuholen und einsparungen auszuverhandeln landete darabos einen bauchfleck der sonderklasse der nun dem steuerzahler teuer zu stehen kommt
6741169 der minister w re gut beraten wenn er aus seiner missgl ckten amtszeit die konsequenzen zieht und kein weiteres mal seine dienste dem heer und der bundesregierung anbietet
6741170 abgesehen davon dass gernot darmann alle chancen hat ber die landesliste in den nationalrat einzuziehen gibt es ja auch eine bundesliste
6741171 jag accepterar att det kan ta viss tid att sekretesspr va en beg ran om allm n handling men jag finner det oacceptabelt att det efter flera p st tningar ska dr ja en och en halv m nad eller m jligen mer eftersom jag nnu inte vet n r jag f r handlingarna innan min beg ran behandlas

6741177 la mujer nace libre y debe permanecer igual al hombre en derechos
6741178 las madres las hijas las hermanas representantes de la naci n piden ser constituidas en asamblea nacional
6741179 si la mujer es capaz de comportarse como un ser racional no hay porqu tratarla como una esclava o como una bestia que depende de la inteligencia del hombre cuando se une a l
6741180 las mujeres hemos de obedecer las leyes igual que los hombres y por lo tanto hemos de tener voz para decidir su elaboraci n
6741181 el hombre ha usurpado incluso las prerrogativas del mismo jehov al pretender que tiene derecho a asignar a la mujer un campo de la educaci n cuando en realidad esto es privativo de su consciencia y de su dios
6741182 tonight people of all faiths and beliefs have joined together for freedom of religion and all that is american
6741183 to ensure that all are treated equally and with dignity
6741184 our mission is to protect the constitutional rights of individuals one of the most important rights is the freedom to practice religion without government interference in this case we feel the government has interfered
6741185 numerous mainstream portland churches advertise bible study groups womens groups and church services in private homes these are just as much open to the public as rabbi wilanskys sabbath services
6741186 the city doesnt take action against landlords about noise and loud parties until after numerous complaints who made the decision to jump on rabbi wilansky after only one complaint

6741188 two tuxedos overlapping hearts or intertwined flowers with best wishes inside two hearts one promise one says
6741189 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6741190 i know for sure what jesus would not do would be to sweep into a community gather up large numbers of people separate them from one another and deport them to another country in my own mind in my own conscience thats crystal clear jesus would not do that
6741191 we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counterproductive
6741192 we urge the federal government to fully respect the well founded principles of conscientious objection

6741194 die drei entf hrten schiffe sind immer noch in bewegung und steuern offenbar auf somalische hoheitsgew sser zu
6741195 ein kriegsschiff wurde auf den weg geschickt um die schiffe aufzusp ren und zu beobachten
6741196 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6741197 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6741198 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6741199 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6741200 all the believers lived in a wonderful harmony holding everything in common they sold whatever they owned and pooled their resources so that each persons need was met
6741201 tempers flared and they ended up going their separate ways
6741202 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6741203 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6741204 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6741205 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6741206 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6741207 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6741208 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6741209 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6741210 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6741211 fifty one percent of the likely voters surveyed thought obama was too risky compared with 38 for mccain the arizona senator had an advantage of 10 percentage points when it came to being seen as a strong leader
6741212 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6741213 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6741214 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6741215 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6741216 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them

6741219 weve been hearing this rumor a lot and we would love to know where its coming from
6741220 there have been no strategy meetings there are no bills being drafted the councilman feels that extending term limits for the mayor would be a great idea bloomberg has been doing a great job
6741221 ive always had a policy of never saying what im going to do
6741222 i am a big believer in change i think you after a period of time you get stale you learn what cant be done
6741223 the public has picked eight years for example in new york city eight years for the presidency of the united states and weve had presidents that people wish could have stayed on and presidents people were happy to see go
6741224 go check this out because i bet its your kind of thing my kind of thing i play the song fall in sweet sweet love with it and quickly go buy a couple albums
6741225 who invented all these stupid words they just dont do it for me
6741226 the performance of bernanke and paulson over the past year is a different question than their performance over their entire tenure
6741227 the fed deserves low pre crisis marks for not using its regulatory authority to put a stop to egregious lending practices
6741228 by ignoring the foundations of the crisis even as the cracks were forming and propagating the fed the treasury the sec the fdic ofheo and the bond rating companies all deserve an
6741229 however since the crisis broke a year ago their performance has been much better
6741230 bernanke and paulson have both been very active importantly they have collaborated more than any fed and treasury heads that i can remember
6741231 they have both actively tried to prevent a panic by jawboning constantly in a clear and balanced way without their involvement the financial structure would have shuddered and possibly crumbled several times in the past year
6741232 i give bernanke high marks for using unconventional moves such as lending treasuries with level 3 securities as collateral to unregulated investment banks possibly illegal but its easier to ask for forgiveness than permission
6741233 i give paulson medium marks for trying his darnest to talk the dollar up giving the feds medicine of interest rate cuts time to work through the economy also i give paulson high marks for trying so hard to alleviate the siv crisis although it didnt work
6741234 however i downgraded paulsons mark because i think his proposal to make the us taxpayer the bagholder for the gses is a terrible mistake and a very bad precedent
6741235 ultimately i gave bernanke a high grade and paulson an average grade although these certainly arent average times
6741236 the entire regulatory regime of the us financial community requires the largest overhaul since the great depression
6741237 to accomplish this while preventing an outright financial crisis is like trying to repair an aircraft that is sporadically losing aileron control while trying to set up final approach in turbulence
6741238 not to mention that the us is in the middle of a presidential election whichever side wins there will be a big change in the cast of characters especially the agency heads treasury sec fdic and fhfa which is the new agency that will be doing ofheos job to regulate the gses during these unsettled times
6741239 ik mag toch hopen dat dit een besloten bijeenkomst is en dat wat ik hier zeg onder ons blijft
6741240 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6741241 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses

6741246 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6741247 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6741248 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6741249 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6741250 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6741251 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6741252 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6741253 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6741254 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6741255 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6741256 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6741257 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6741258 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6741259 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6741260 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6741261 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6741262 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6741263 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6741264 w kwestii uk adu o partnerstwie nadal jednak nie rozstrzygni to kilku spornych punkt w w tym przede wszystkim sprawy ewentualnej odpowiedzialno ci o nierzy usa przed irackimi s dami
6741265 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6741266 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6741267 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6741268 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6741269 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6741270 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6741271 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6741272 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6741273 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6741274 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6741275 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6741276 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6741277 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6741278 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6741279 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6741280 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6741281 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6741282 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6741283 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6741284 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6741285 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6741286 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6741287 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6741288 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

6741294 spanair no estuvo a la altura en un primer momento
6741295 se act e pol ticamente para combatir la ca a del empleo
6741296 las empresas no presentan expedientes de regulaci n de empleo porque se estaban centrando hasta ahora en la no renovaci n de contratos que es lo que muestran estas cifras
6741297 la no contrataci n en el sector de la construcci n ha contagiado a otros sectores en especial a la industria
6741298 la situaci n ser muy dura en especial en el sector de la construcci n para empresas peque as pero tambi n seguir la crisis en el sector de la construcci n y en la industria auxiliar del autom vil
6741299 nos llega demasiada informaci n de nuestros comit s de empresas de que las compa as se plantean hacer reducciones de empleo totales o parciales
6741300 la situaci n para nosotros es muy preocupante y el gobierno ha de actuar ya y dise ar planes para inyectar dinero para dar liquidez a las empresas y mantener el empleo igual que hacen con los bancos y cajas
6741301 la situaci n ha descrito es que ahora ya se est produciendo destrucci n de ocupaci n y ni siquiera la contrataci n temporal del turismo ha podido compensar la ca da de empleo
6741302 la crisis ya est aqu y las empresas han dejado de contratar a causa de los problemas de liquidez
6741303 estos datos muestran que en muchos casos en un 30 se est contratando mano de obra no cualificada por lo que seguimos teniendo un mercado laboral precarizado
6741304 las respuesta para paliar la crisis no ha aportado soluciones y ahora la situaci n de crisis est instalada en la psicolog a de la gente
6741305 el pato lo pagar n los contratos temporales y seguir bajando la cifra global de contratos
6741306 deseo que si hay una votaci n favorable a los presupuestos sea precisamente porque stos incluyen un sistema de financiaci n justo para catalu a o m s justo que el que tenemos ahora

6741309 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6741310 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6741311 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6741312 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6741313 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6741314 this is a planning took where all things are going
6741315 ada empat tim yang akan memperebutkan scudetto tapi inter bakal dapat persaingan alot milan juga akan berburu scudetto juga seperti juventus dan roma
6741316 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6741317 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6741318 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6741319 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6741320 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6741321 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this

6741328 with the nov 1 2008 deadline approaching momentum is building to ensure that banks and credit institutions comply were getting a lot of questions from institutions as to what they can do to comply and fill in any gaps not covered by existing programs
6741329 were working with existing customers and reaching out to new customers regarding facta compliance
6741330 i think facta gives banks and creditors the opportunity to look across the enterprise and create some consistent controls
6741331 emc consulting really has a risk assessment service that helps customers go in and determine how facta affects their organization on an enterprise wide basis identifying affected accounts and services across processes and customer channels examining existing procedures and systems brought in to comply with prior regulations and helping them understand new threats and identify gaps in coverage by bringing in processes and sound capabilities to measure the effectiveness of their facta program and the controls they have in place
6741332 wir wollen einmal mehr unter beweis stellen dass ein bergfilmfestival nicht wettkampf sein muss

6741335 this rise is no surprise but it will push up costs of everything for people and the economy
6741336 this is a very important part of our road network and i believe the high bridge tolls are impeding our economic development
6741337 they also have a major impact on residents who need to access services across the river many people on the south bank travel frequently to the hospitals in hull
6741338 the toll increase means it will become more expensive for goods to travel which in turn will raise prices people pay for things
6741339 the rise will affect tourism as well because people just cant afford to go across the bridge to see attractions
6741340 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6741341 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6741342 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6741343 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6741344 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6741345 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6741346 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6741347 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6741348 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6741349 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6741350 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6741351 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

6741360 lo que dicen las c maras es que no hubo ninguna explosi n durante el despegue
6741361 ser n las cajas amarillas o negras como son conocidas las que lo diluciden
6741362 que se est n dando informaciones amarillas y malintencionadas sobre lo que es llanamente un accidente
6741363 se adoptaron todas las medidas de seguridad que se pudieron tomar
6741364 ya que no se puede olvidar que el piloto siempre es el primer interesado en la seguridad del veh culo que lidera puesto que va en primera fila del mismo
6741365 es el medio m s seguro que existe ya que los aviones sufren un examen cada d a y otro antes de cada vuelo aunque casos como ste sean m s espectaculares que los que se cobran las carreteras de nuestro pa s cada d a

6741369 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6741370 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6741371 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6741372 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

6741381 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god

6741410 levels of activity in 2008 should match those seen in 2007 and there are significant new business opportunities
6741411 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6741412 in addition the new united states president will have to wrestle with twin fiscal and budget deficits in early 2009 and post the olympics chinese growth may slow due to inflationary particularly food price concerns and the impact that a weakening united states economy has on the rest of the world

6741428 im too smart busy to waste my time doing that
6741429 its just too expensive for me to pay 5 a day for my daughters to eat a school lunch
6741430 and the quality of the food isnt that great either
6741431 like everyone else the district is affected by rising food prices and the fuel to deliver that food
6741432 parents see the price increase every time they go to the grocery store
6741433 its just one more thing that is going up as a result of gas prices
6741434 whether its buying our sons school clothes textbooks pencils or lunch its one more thing that is affecting our wallets you cant blame the farmers you cant blame the school districts its just the reality of the world now
6741435 so this would make the hybrid bus cost about what the yellow bus costs
6741436 its just so easy to quick run in grab a few things and be out the door in 15 minutes
6741437 because of the smaller size of the store its easier for me to walk up and down the aisles
6741438 our son lives in henrietta and is looking forward to seeing what the new store looks like inside
6741439 i cant wait to see the expression on the faces of customers as we welcome them to their new store
6741440 up until now our stores used a wood burning oven that did not offer much flexibility in terms of efficiency
6741441 this new oven the second one weve installed in a store allows us to shut off parts of the oven that are not being used saving energy its also fun because customers can watch the ovens light up when they are in use
6741442 we have replaced less energy efficient forms of lighting with led lighting which produce less heat and high efficiency fluorescent fixtures
6741443 like all new wegmans stores this store uses environmentally friendly glycol in medium temperature refrigerated cases instead of regular refrigerant dramatically reducing carbon dioxide emissions
6741444 the old store has been my home for many years and i am definitely going to miss it but its going to be a lot of fun to start a new one
6741445 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
6741446 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal

6741450 what she told me was she stopped and went to proceed across the area and thats when she ran into keirstin johnsons vehicle
6741451 i think they need to do something about that alley its a bad spot
6741452 i enjoy coming out here and finding something to make my operation more profitable and meeting more farmers and friends
6741453 i have sheep and am also an electrical contractor this is a good way to find out what other people are doing that maybe youre not doing
6741454 the majority of people who come here are farmers or those who own farming operations and the others are neighbors
6741455 its not just muskingum county weve got people who came from all over like from coshocton licking and morgan counties thats a good thing each year we have about the same amount of people but this year we have more we did things a little different this year by not having any of the equipment dealers which actually didnt hurt the turnout
6741456 we make the program fit the farm we go to
6741457 we were up here in may and thought a presentation on the pros and cons of teff bermuda grass would be good because thats what they grow up here also with the cost of things going up its good to find out the fertility of the soil instead of buying more fertilizer than you need well also have a tiling demonstration and talk about drainage systems and wetland determination
6741458 a lot of folks wonder can you do it and make it pay
6741459 it all depends on if you can get the forage and its worth it if you get extra forage hay is a good source of nutrition and manure is a good source of nitrogen you can buy poultry and hog manures pretty cheap late may and early june is a good time to lay manure on hay fields

6741464 its a big thing it represents the dedication of the staff to receive continued training and get the latest training
6741465 we are helping kids in four avenues they are socially physically mentally and academically we help their progress and give more security for them to participate and meet the challenges of life of which there are so many
6741466 its a chance for the teachers to meet the parents and they become a team too in helping the child to benefit to the fullest extent it helps the transition from home to center

6741611 just read the amazon link this looks fantastic i loved the baroque cycle and look forward to seei
6741612 sorry but it means precisely what i thought it would mean with all its nuances and applications in
6741613 if i was a paedophile childrens author id just go ahead and sign
6741614 yes probably they are doesnt mean it wouldnt bwe a laudable action
6741615 we havent made wembley our home yet thats the biggest thing
6741616 it feels like when were going out there its tough
6741617 every game is tough these days but we need to make it daunting for players and teams coming to wembley
6741618 we will get there we will build on that but its about getting the confidence up which will happen in the qualifiers
6741619 the manager thrives on challenges he wants the best out of the team and hell get that
6741620 people expect change straight away and it just doesnt happen like that
6741621 it is step by step its about bonding together as a team as a unit and that takes time
6741622 there is a lot difference its the tiny things the minute details
6741623 it wont happen overnight people who understand the game know that managers sometimes come in there is a big blitz of goals and then it fades away
6741624 what we have done is the right way slowly we are getting better
6741625 we are going up and down a little bit but were going in the right direction
6741626 its in place now weve got the coach the captain the vice captain now we can start moving forward
6741627 we have got the cobwebs out of the way back into the england mindset
6741628 we have got to go away and there are some important games for our clubs but we are set for england now
6741629 im talking about players who are different animals to when i was a player theyve had opportunities to go to clubs particularly on loan and were reluctant to do it
6741630 footballers are changing these days some dont love the game as much as they should do if you love football you want to play
6741631 it doesnt annoy me but its a sad reflection on the people themselves one or two have had opportunities in the last few weeks to go to very good clubs at a very good level just to get games theres no hidden agenda they said no
6741632 footballers are a strange breed these days trust me i thought i was strange
6741633 what a pleasant surprise such a nice change from normal
6741634 in effect loch tay is a completely unused loch its unappreciated and as a tourist destination its just got so much to offer
6741635 gone are the days of people wanting to sit in a wayfarer dinghy in a cold wet wetsuit in scotland
6741636 what were hoping to achieve is a flotilla of 30ft to 40ft sailing yachts which people that are staying at the resort can crew also it would be open to local people as well
6741637 he stole from churches he stole from poor people he stole from hungry people
6741638 every day we work with people who made bad decisions out of desperation we believe it was the case here
6741639 he told me that at this point in my life i want to do something to help other people
6741640 i want people to continue to support the ministry and not lose faith in its goals and achievements
6741641 i was looking for some evidence of a mental breakdown this was so out of character
6741642 the new recommendation from the smc is to be welcomed new data supporting the role of versatis in post herpetic neuralgia will further establish that such a novel non systemic treatment approach offers significant benefits in the older patient group who suffer co morbidities and consequential polypharmacy
6741643 the smc is to be congratulated on its revised decision for versatis theyve taken a huge step forward in extending options for pain relief for people living with neuropathic pain this decision will alleviate a lot of suffering
6741644 he did not commit the offense for which he was convicted
6741645 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the u s where we can do that
6741646 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
6741647 graphics arent best in class which may prevent stupid people from not checking out this game
6741648 gets the job done for bringing galaga into the world of next gen consoles
6741649 the game will feel and play differently each week with adidas live season if ronaldinho has a great match on the weekend youll feel the difference when you pick up the controller as his in game attributes increase
6741650 t he case raises the broader policy and constitutional considerations that argue against using civil liability to control the behavior of pregnant women
6741651 expanded access to prenatal education and heath care facilities will far more likely serve the very real state interest in preventing increasing numbers of children from being born in to lives of pain and despair
6741652 as the president of the law review obama didnt write articles he edited and reviewed them
6741653 they probably dont want to have you reporters going back
6741654 barack obama originally emerged on the national scene as the first african american president of the harvard law review this selection may have been based on factors that do not necessarily reflect merit as he himself recognizes he has refused to answer questions about his days at harvard such holes in his life are a recurring feature he was clearly a man of promise given the historic step that was taken when he was appointed president of the law review has he fulfilled his promise as a legal scholar one thing he did not do while at the review was publish his own work the absence of a paper trail is a pattern throughout his academic and to some extent his political career the pattern of leaving no intellectual footprints pre dates harvard he has claimed he lost his senior thesis from columbia university where he majored in political science the thesis was on soviet nuclear disarmament the depth of knowledge on display in barry obamas undergraduate thesis is of particular interest because he was wrong about a crucial kennedy khrushchev conference and about the diplomatic history between america and the soviets how likely is it that someone would lose his senior thesis particularly someone who thought his life was compelling enough that he would write an autobiography just a few years later
6741655 lisa madigan is the attorney general of illinois a busy job seeing as how governors keep getting indicted around here and created a public access counselor to handle sticky situations in these parts when politicians like soetorobama try to stonewall freedom of information requests like the annenberg files the chicago political machine is protecting for him word is if those files get out obvious and damaging links between soetorobama and unrepentant terrorist william ayers will become even more obvious and damaging its the same thing with his lies about baipa these documents will contradict recent statements hes made and hell be further shown to be the prevaricator we know him to be thats a fancy word for liar liar pants on fire for when you dont want to call someone a liar liar pants on fire except that we kind of just did via reversespin attorney general lisa madigan is committed to ensuring open and honest government in illinois as part of that commitment the attorney generals office works closely with members of the public and government officials to ensure compliance with the freedom of information act foia and the open meetings act oma for the first time in illinois history attorney general madigan established the position of public access counselor within the office to respond to questions concerning foia and oma offer valuable training on the requirements of these laws to public officials the media and members of the public and to take action to resolve disputes arising under these laws through the public access counselor and the experienced attorneys in the public access and opinions division attorney general madigans office will work to ensure that these laws fulfill their goal of providing the public with access to government documents and decision making public access can be reached at 217 558 0486 or by writing to the attorney generals springfield office at 500 s second street springfield il 62705 after our current illinois governor and key soetorobama surrogate rod blagojevich is indicted possibly by the end of the year and all the political fallout settles we expect lisa madigan to be governor here in 2010 we have it on good authority that after mccain wins the presidential race in the fall soetorobama believes he can run for governor of illinois in 2010 and win that instead he does not want to return to the senate where he has to once more be one of 100 where even someone as abject as larry craig actually has more accomplishments under his belt than the junior senator from illinois but representing the interests of the obama nation of course once again soetorobama will be up against a formidable female opponent but this time the democratic party wont tie that opponents hands behind her back wed like to see them try to do that to a madigan but if lisa madigans public access counselor really does counsel real public access to those annenberg papers then soetorobama could ultimately have a hard time getting even that part time law school professor job back let alone running for another elected office from what we hear on the ground here in chicago theres something big erupting relating to these papers baipa and the sudden odd retirement of state senate president emile jones soetorobamas mentor and ladder to his us senate seat and all of this is connected to tony rezko somehow but its a complicated web prosecutor patrick fitzgerald is still working on making progress daily with perhaps new developments come october imagine that
6741656 what is more important is to find means by which we can redistribute our economic gains to the benefit of all
6741657 there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
6741658 i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development
6741659 certainly there is no limit to taxation if the benefits derived from public services by society measure up to the cost in taxation which they have to pay
6741660 it is a fallacy to say that there is this limit and it is a fallacy to rely mainly on individual free enterprise to get the savings
6741661 tax laws that restore some balance to the distribution of the nations wealth
6741662 we can only compete if our government makes the investments that give us a fighting chance
6741663 and if we know that our families have some net beneath which they cannot fall
6741664 if left to the individual consolidation will take a long time to come we have to look at priorities in terms of what is good for society and on this basis we may find it necessary to force people to do things they would not do otherwise
6741665 the government should restrict the size of farms that can be owned by one individual throughout the country
6741666 one who has read marx cannot fail to see that corporations are not only what marx referred to as the advanced stage of capitalism
6741667 but marx even called it finance capitalism by which a few would control the finances of so many and through this have not only economic power but political power as well
6741668 we hold them up as role models and our mythology is steeped in stories of men on the make
6741669 the problems of poverty and racism the uninsured and the unemployed are rooted in the desire among those at the top of the social ladder to maintain their wealth and status whatever the cost
6741670 i did feel that there was something to prove to my father
6741671 word got back to kenyatta that the old man was a troublemaker and he was called in to see the president
6741672 the problem of barack obamas relationship with bill ayers will not go away
6741673 not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis
6741674 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6741675 as we see this phenomenon occurring farther and farther north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6741676 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6741677 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6741678 what are our customers interested in how can we reach them
6741679 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6741680 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6741681 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6741682 we do not believe they were really interested in having people turn themselves in
6741683 we have had three indians winning the coveted medals in different disciplines we are delighted to welcome vijendra into our family of spicejetters by offering him unlimited free personal travel for life along with abhinav bindra and sushil kumar
6741684 in order to intervene in this crucial segment access is needed and section 377 law prohibiting homosexuality makes it difficult if this goes it will help a great deal in de stigmatisation and improve access to the target groups
6741685 having a good judicial verdict in some on going cases will have a positive effect on our efforts
6741686 indias dedicated focus on hiv prevention is fetching dividends we are seeing the beginning of the stabilisation of the epidemic in the country
6741687 headline inflation continues to be a matter of concern the point to be stressed is that the inflation rate for each group is measured on an annual point to point basis hence it is largely influenced by the trend in the corresponding week of the previous year which is the base year
6741688 you told me and i heard it now you decide
6741689 let us work together and identify those families who might be facing hardship after losing their land at singur the state government is ready to provide them alternative livelihood
6741690 i also told the tatas to come forward in this respect and they have agreed
6741691 i informed him that we are talking to tc leadership on this issue he tata wanted to talk to me and i felt it was our responsibility to address his concern
6741692 how can the government acquire somebodys land to give it to somebody else
6741693 if she gandhi asks me so i will think over it
6741694 i have come here to meet gandhi and lalu prasad any decision on the issue will be taken only after my meeting with senior upa leaders
6741695 a 70 year old died after drinking the polluted water around 35 persons were hospitalised and were given necessary treatment as of today the situation is under control
6741696 our team of doctors lead by the chief district health officer had immediately rushed to the spot and have taken neccessary steps to stop further contamination of the water
6741697 it is boldly inscribed with lettering that certainly looks very early medieval to my untrained eye i dont know yet what the letters spell out but if they indicate a royal owner it might be worth tens of thousand of pounds
6741698 the oca would like to thank the government of peoples republic of china for their uninhibited support in organising the most friendliest and outstanding sporting extravaganza
6741699 the support of the citizens of beijing and other cities organising the games have been greatly instrumental in making the games
6741700 the games have provided possibly the best infrastructure and atmosphere for the athletes to flourish and show their abilities
6741701 athletes from asia have performed creditably in the beijing games with nations like india indonesia thailand malaysia tajikistan and vietnam winning individual medals in certain sports for the first time in the history of olympics
6741702 we will be looking at strategic acquisitions to strengthen the product range
6741703 if we declare a bonus then dividend payout will go down substantially
6741704 there will be complete strike in kashmir for the next three days peaceful protests in the day and between evening and night prayers shall continue
6741705 people have given their verdict by turning out in hundreds of thousands over the past weeks they want freedom
6741706 india should realise that kashmir issue has to be resolved involving new delhi islamabad and representatives of jammu and kashmir
6741707 well i can now announce that tom and i are and we are very happy

6741709 my body is still in good condition so i have no problems
6741710 obviously i got older but i have gained more experience technically and strategically in fighting against u s russian and cuban boxers
6741711 the cuban will be more difficult to beat than picardi
6741712 the thing that i will worry about the most is his counterpunch i will have to adjust my style by not moving too fast
6741713 ich bin sehr gelassen weil ich die operative entwicklung des konzerns sehe und damit die wahren werte kenne

6741722 the print was in deplorable condition and even while giving full attention from only a few yards the dialogues between parbati and her husband were very difficult to follow
6741723 the sound has become inaudible and the film has become obscure the bfa projectionists struggled to raise the volume to almost no effect still the dialogues could not be clearly heard
6741724 apple sold these devices on the promise that they were twice as fast as the pre existing phones and that they would function suitably or properly on the 3g network but thus far apple and the phone have failed to deliver on this promise
6741725 not only do multiple heart events increase healthcare costs due to additional hospitalizations tests and physician visits but they also result in higher morbidity for many patients
6741726 the potentially favorable profile of these compounds was achieved through the use of our trap r computational drug discovery technology
6741727 we are currently conducting activities necessary to select a potential development candidate
6741728 nexavar is the only systemic therapy with proven efficacy and tolerability in hcc across multiple patient populations
6741729 liver cancer is the third largest global cancer killer worldwide and there is a significant need for new therapies that can be used at all stages in the course of the disease to delay disease progression and prolong life
6741730 regulatory clearance for us to proceed with our phase 1 study of rdea594 within six months from designation as a clinical candidate is a testament to the efficiency of our development organization and the importance we place on our gout program a program we intend to expand with second generation compounds from our exciting ongoing research in this area
6741731 earlier this quarter we initiated a phase 2a proof of concept study of rdea806 a prodrug of rdea594 which should allow us to provide an early confirmation of rdea594s activity in the target population of patients with gout

6741747 a new study says teenage girls are having less sex which experts attribute to a shift away from older boyfriends as well as societys growing acceptance of adolescent sexuality
6741748 over the last 20 years canadian society has gradually become more relaxed and accepting of adolescent sexuality and that has translated into a greater knowledge in young people and most importantly a greater comfort in seeking out information and services like having a conversation with a doctor that knowledge has empowered them to make conscious decisions about their own behaviour said mr mckay adding that knowledge often leads to abstinence
6741749 taboo impulses can be titillating but more often theyre a source of concern for those who harbor secret wishes or unusual desires if you prefer gallows humor to slapstick or kinky to vanilla take heart dark inclinations have their own logic and benefits
6741750 australia has had four great prime ministers and four failures the other 18 have been successful to a lesser or greater extent without being great that adds up to 26 the number of prime ministers we have had so far including kevin rudd
6741751 these are the conclusions to which i have come after studying a great amount of the relevant literature and conversations with about 40 historians academics journalists politicians and former politicians as well as laypeople who simply read australian political history and think about it
6741752 my logic with prime ministerial ranking comes from nation building successful reforms initiatives election wins and longevity as prime minister however i add marks for being a successful prime minister in either of the two world wars and for leaving on his own terms electoral defeat debacles and divisiveness cause me to subtract marks
6741753 arming syria would lead to a strategic change and could destabilize the middle east and the world
6741754 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power
6741755 why in the world would we need to deploy our missiles in syria against whom we have no enemies in the region
6741756 we understand russias stance regarding the breakaway regions and understand that it came in retaliation to georgian provocation

6741758 the plane was rocking back and forth until i suspected it was going to fall

6741801 he won his last two races and is ready to go it will be a big step for him going into a group two but the horse is improving all the time
6741802 i think the step up in trip will suit him
6741803 maybe two months ago you would have said we had no chance of staying up
6741804 but weve put ourselves in a fighting position by getting off the bottom and if you get a couple of results on the bounce then youre out of it
6741805 eventually were going to see a tremendous amount of waste heat recovery applications but thats 5 to 10 years off
6741806 we have to get to that 10 percent efficiency threshold to start making it viable
6741807 the market is a lot of wasted energy and that is by definition a zero cost feedstock

6741811 this rise is no surprise but it will push up costs of everything for people and the economy
6741812 this is a very important part of our road network and i believe the high bridge tolls are impeding our economic development
6741813 they also have a major impact on residents who need to access services across the river many people on the south bank travel frequently to the hospitals in hull
6741814 the toll increase means it will become more expensive for goods to travel which in turn will raise prices people pay for things
6741815 the rise will affect tourism as well because people just cant afford to go across the bridge to see attractions

6741910 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6741911 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6741912 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6741913 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6741914 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6741915 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is

6741921 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6741922 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6741923 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6741924 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6741925 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6741926 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home
6741927 this is about shifting the power back to the people

6741932 when will silicon run out of gas can it fuel this exponential growth for 40 years to come
6741933 we got very close to the limit at 45 nanometers we were able to innovate our way out of what seemed an unsolvable problem weve got some challenges ahead of us it looks like 32 nanometers is on track but you go beyond that and it looks a little bit iffy
6741934 we think cmos will continue to be the workhorse for many years in the future

6741938 that altercation took place after jail personnel observed mathes behaving irrationally in his cell
6741939 he was becoming increasingly agitated and displaying signs of angry aggression
6741940 when an inmate is causing problems that may cause him harm its important we put them in an environment where they cant do that

6741944 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6741945 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6741946 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6741947 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6741948 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6741949 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark

6741953 maybe two months ago you would have said we had no chance of staying up
6741954 but weve put ourselves in a fighting position by getting off the bottom and if you get a couple of results on the bounce then youre out of it
6741955 la corrupci n y la crisis inmobiliaria les ha dejado sin sus ahorros y en muchos casos sin su casa
6741956 como otras muchas urbanizaciones a lo largo de la costa blanca
6741957 los terrenos yacen sin actividad sin agua ni electricidad y sin perspectivas de futuro
6741958 no s lo con peque as firmas sino incluso con constructoras de gran volumen que han aceptado dep sitos para viviendas a sabiendas de no disponer de financiaci n suficiente
6741959 una gran cantidad de proyectos que no ten an ni siquiera permiso del gobierno de la generalitat pero que han contado con el visto bueno de alcaldes corruptos la costa est superpoblada de este tipo de urbanizaciones
6741960 con las cifras oficiales en la mano se ha constru do tanta vivienda que incluso con un mercado en condiciones normales hubieran originado una burbuja de precios
6741961 el nacimiento de un desarrollo que ya ha desfigurado f sicamente las l neas de la costa mediterr nea del pa s
6741962 lo que una vez fue el mercado m s potente de la segunda vivienda en europa ha sufrido el mayor crash del momento por culpa de la corrupci n y la sobreexplotaci n del territorio
6741963 nadie est seguro de lo que pasar en el futuro
6741964 el valor de nuestras viviendas es bastante inferior al que tuvimos que pagar por ellas
6741965 pero los agentes inmobiliarios aqu te mienten con tal de conseguir salirse con la suya
6741966 todos los buenos motivos por los que los europeos del norte han escogido esta rea continuan siendo v lidos tenemos un clima estupendo las playas son bell simas y las conexiones v a a rea han mejorado
6741967 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6741968 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6741969 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6741970 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6741971 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6741972 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6741973 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6741974 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6741975 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6741976 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6741977 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6741978 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6741979 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6741980 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6741981 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6741982 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6741983 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6741984 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6741985 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6741986 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6741987 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6741988 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6741989 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6741990 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6741991 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6741992 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6741993 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6741994 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6741995 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6741996 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6741997 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6741998 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6741999 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6742000 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6742001 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6742002 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6742003 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6742004 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6742005 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6742006 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6742007 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6742008 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6742009 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6742010 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6742011 make a hundred thousand dollars a year for being able to spell java
6742012 es imprescindible definir el estatuto de los observadores militares con este fin debe tomarse una decisi n pol tica a cumplir por los militares

6742016 nicolas sarkozy a fait fausse route en d cidant de r engager des troupes sans quon red finisse leur mission
6742017 il se trompe aussi en tant engag dans une strat gie militaire qui est celle des am ricains
6742018 une convocation durgence du parlement pour que nous d battions et que nous votions sur la question de savoir si on doit maintenir des troupes en afghanistan
6742019 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6742020 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6742021 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6742022 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6742023 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6742024 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6742025 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6742026 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6742027 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6742028 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6742029 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6742030 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6742031 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6742032 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6742033 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6742034 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6742035 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6742036 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6742037 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6742038 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6742039 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6742040 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6742041 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6742042 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6742043 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6742044 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6742045 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6742046 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6742047 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6742048 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6742049 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6742050 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6742051 the army and police arrested a suspected bomber not far away from scene of the attack
6742052 they also recovered a suicide jacket from a nearby mosque and seized explosives
6742053 the army has killed hundreds of innocent people and we attacked it to teach it a lesson
6742054 the reason for my ranking is that blackberry had much success with creating a device for extended e mail to mobile devices and as a result of organizations rolling out e mail as the first real enterprise app businesses wanted to leverage their hardware investment and broaden the blackberry devices extensibility as well as minimize management for multiple devices
6742055 its browser interface is very strong the cost of the solution has grown more favorable but us 400 for the initial device compared to blackberry devices was a huge impediment its new price should be more favorable for greater adoption within the enterprise but i believe apple lost some potential customers due to its initial high costs of procurement the result buyers turned to blackberries
6742056 drastically impeded penetration as sales resources that had iphones for personal use couldnt consolidate tasks to one device
6742057 they still had to use their blackberries so until recently apples iphone faced a major hurdle as resources who wanted to port over their iphone to support business activities had to depend on two devices to handle calls and e mails now though the product supports exchange so its possible iphone will gain some traction but apple isnt known for running enterprise business applications well see how that changes
6742058 the blackberry devices are just a few of many devices that support business mobile apps sprint has a wide range of solutions that can address our customers needs regardless of the device they are carrying most smartphones can support a variety of business mobile apps and most devices are compatible with gps based business applications including several rugged devices that are well suited for tough business environments
6742059 most of the solutions that have been successful outside of e mail are the more blue collar industry solutions like those focused on fleet management and field services
6742060 we started with the fact that most vendors approach was to bring in a mobile front end and build synchronization between the device and enterprise platforms
6742061 the problem with those approaches one is that from a user perspective its rather painful to learn how the mobile crm app works on their device usually a different navigation paradigm was involved and then you had to remember to keep things synchronized from an application management perspective its also quite painful it has to manage another version of the application for each device for many different models with unique features so the cost of administration for it managers isnt trivial its pretty significant
6742062 we realized the limitations of this approach and in 2004 when our partnership with rim began we sat down with them and said hey blackberry is now the de facto platform for mobile enterprise users
6742063 we leveraged the capabilities of rims push and synchronization technology so that data and communications automatically gets pushed to the user similar to the solution they came up with e mail synchronization
6742064 unlike other mobile device manufacturers who access enterprise data through their mobile internet networks blackberry has taken the approach of installing blackberry enterprise servers within firewalls that gives them access to internal enterprise systems
6742065 were looking at report and analysis distribution features as well as workforce management theres a lot of ideas in the works but we plan on tackling the most common problems first theyll be a natural extension of native capabilities on the device and well just add on more features and capabilities over time
6742066 it looks like this dell mp3 player is backed by some pretty smart minds though i think it will fail nothing has really put a dent in apples market share and their have been some attempts that havent gone so well a k a the zune
6742067 when the only embodiment of this grand scheme is a story that was planted in the wall street journal and a story in businessweek anything is possible
6742068 the reality of it is dell has some really cool software in zing the middleware so thats promising but running an online music or media store is not like selling printers or notebooks or pcs at the lowest possible price but maybe im wrong maybe it doesnt matter about the experience and songs are just commodities for the people who pay for them
6742069 certainly apple could use some real competition but it would seem to me to be an extremely steep uphill battle that will be very expensive but then again i dont know
6742070 maybe the pc trolls will finally understand being an apple customer in most cases means being a happy customer
6742071 i think the fact that a lot of pc manufactures sell cheap computers affects these results after all i think many users are disappointed in their 400 laptop running vista of course apple sells at a level that brings more satisfaction another possible reason is all the bloatware and anti virus suites forced on pc users from the get go this in itself slows a perfectly good pc down
6742072 the companies that drop in acsi are all windows based it is very likely that vista contributed to it
6742073 not only is apple the beneficiary of this vista dissatisfaction the synergy between ipods iphones and its computer products has helped has well
6742074 nice gesture but not really worth much they should stop billing altogether and give a bonus three months starting from when they actually get working three free months of a crippled poorly functioning service is hardly worth being excited about
6742075 wow that is a great pr move apple really i havent ever had any problems but i gladly take the extra 60 days in addition to the 30 you already gave me and smacklin the service has worked great for the majority of us
6742076 its very rare unless theres some kind of systemic problem like the computer battery thing from a couple of years ago but even then youre still talking about events that are relatively infrequent its like getting struck by lighting
6742077 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6742078 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6742079 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6742080 she came to our office while we were shooting a campaign and she stopped by the shoot we shot a couple of different looks on her but she is not the new face of ed hardy or christian audigier and we are not doing a swimwear line with her
6742081 the connection was reset the connection to the server was reset while the page was loading
6742082 apple has just learned that the choices you make across your business can affect your prospects in china success in china does not mean avoiding such conflicts but in dealing with them intelligently and proactively
6742083 to support peace initiatives and tibetan cultural preservation projects important to the dalai lama
6742084 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6742085 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6742086 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6742087 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6742088 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6742089 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6742090 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6742091 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6742092 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6742093 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6742094 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6742095 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6742096 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6742097 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6742098 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6742099 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6742100 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6742101 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6742102 our second annual inc 5000 continues the most ambitious project in business journalism
6742103 the inc 5000 gives an unrivalled portrait of young underreported companies across all industries doing fascinating things with cutting edge business models as well as older companies that are still showing impressive growth
6742104 growing from a part time hobby to a multimillion dollar business has been an incredible journey
6742105 making the right investments building a great team and staying focused on the customer
6742106 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6742107 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6742108 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6742109 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6742110 rice smiled and if i remember correctly said she had had a chance to deal with georgia and its politicians but had not tasted its wine
6742111 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6742112 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6742113 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6742114 the fundamental basis of this nations laws was given to moses on the mount the fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from exodus and st matthew from isaiah and st paul
6742115 i dont think we emphasize that enough these days if we dont have a proper fundamental moral background we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state
6742116 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
6742117 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6742118 they told me there are going to be resources here
6742119 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6742120 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6742121 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6742122 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6742123 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6742124 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6742125 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6742126 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6742127 a very great honour for a little girl from charlemagne
6742128 if there is something that has guided my life its my wish to excel and go farther to the maximum of my abilities to the top of my goals my hopes and my dreams
6742129 50 and his attorneys met yesterday with suffolk county authorities regarding the fire that destroyed 50s house
6742130 the meeting had been arranged weeks ago 50 is eager to review the findings of the investigation when it is concluded
6742131 no other server based applications other than management software for example antivirus software backup software virtual machine management software etc can be deployed on the physical root machine the root machine should be dedicated to running guest virtual machines
6742132 we are filled with gratitude to god for this honor for taylor university
6742133 the only appropriate response to this exciting news is praise and thanksgiving to god for the great things he has been doing at taylor
6742134 we are deeply appreciative of this external validation from a well respected publication that has been refining the collegiate survey and ranking process for well over 20 years
6742135 this accomplishment is shared by every member of our community from our students alumni faculty and staff to our parents board of trustees and friends and it again reflects that this christ centered university attracts gifted people who together strive to accomplish great things for the kingdom of god
6742136 we appreciate the recognition from u s news as it speaks to the return on investment made by students their families and the taylor faculty
6742137 there are basic benchmarks by which we can hold ourselves accountable but there are also intangible aspects of a taylor education that reinforce its true value we are collaboratively investing in more than four years and degree programs but in people who are creating change
6742138 the formula used to determine which colleges and universities offer the best value relates a schools academic quality as indicated by its 2009 u s news ranking to the 2007 2008 academic year net cost of attendance for a student who receives the average level of need based financial aid
6742139 the higher the quality of the program and the lower the cost the better the deal only schools ranked in or near the top half of their categories are included because we work on the premise that the most significant values are among colleges that are above average academically
6742140 there are many factors behind taylor universitys recognition as a great educational value
6742141 we have been blessed with dedicated alumni friends parents faculty staff and even students who have given of themselves so that others may experience a taylor education
6742142 taylor university has enjoyed his blessings for over 162 years and we are forever grateful
6742143 we appreciate the recognition from u s news as it speaks to the return on investment made by students their families and the taylor faculty
6742144 there are basic benchmarks by which we can hold ourselves accountable but there are also intangible aspects of a taylor education that reinforce its true value we are collaboratively investing in more than four years and degree programs but in people who are creating change
6742145 we never expected these results people should get what they pay for
6742146 we really like sushi and wed take home fish samples and put them in alcohol
6742147 americans spend an estimated us70bn 80bn per year on seafood and we think authorities should do routine dna barcoding of fish
6742148 it bears on a number of issues food safety fraud and protection of endangered species
6742149 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6742150 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6742151 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6742152 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6742153 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6742154 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6742155 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6742156 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6742157 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6742158 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6742159 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6742160 its something ive done for a while and waited to come to charleston
6742161 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6742162 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6742163 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6742164 they really are coming up with some corkers at syndicalist central at the moment
6742165 welcome to magical cake magic allow me to show you some of our creations
6742166 first we have the mr bony hips the cat cake isn t he just the cutest as he stalks his prey
6742167 then theres the ever popular decaying camo fish almost fresh and always delicious
6742168 what do you mean thats unappetizing well then how about the castle warfare cake we put in red and orange gumballs to simulate the severed heads also we construct 50 of the cake from
6742169 hey where are you going dont you want to place an order i havent even shown you our teddy bear drowning in a jacuzzi model
6742170 or the birthday sarcophagus and noah saves the rare 2 headed giraffe
6742171 ok well i can see you have to rush off now but be sure and remember us for your next occasion
6742172 i like that phrasing better because its another iteration of application network routing technology similar to when digital routing really took off
6742173 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6742174 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6742175 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6742176 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6742177 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6742178 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6742179 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6742180 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6742181 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6742182 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6742183 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6742184 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6742185 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6742186 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6742187 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6742188 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6742189 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6742190 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6742191 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6742192 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6742193 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6742194 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6742195 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6742196 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6742197 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6742198 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6742199 no trippin we just have to stop dumping raw feces and piss into the ocean simple
6742200 i didnt know what to expect some kind of moonscape perhaps but it was incredible huge matrices of branching porites coral up to 8 meters 25 feet high had established creating a thriving coral reef habitat
6742201 throughout other parts of the lagoon it was awesome to see coral cover as high as 80 percent and large tree like branching coral formations with trunks 30 centimeters 12 inches thick
6742202 it seems like you won approval from all who write bs on every subject every day the know it alls stay true to yourself never change to please others or to fit in
6742203 we condemn all interference by france in a conflict which is the business of the people of niger
6742204 any french military presence is considered illegal by the mnj
6742205 who has ever seen french troops fighting alongside niger troops the mnj is nothing more than a group of armed bandits and should be treated as such we dont need a foreign army to do that
6742206 on the contrary theres a return to the old order
6742207 we are going to attack the uranium mines including those belonging to areva halt the operation of the plants or the opening up of new sites and target the road shipments to the sea
6742208 the army refuses to confront the mnj but kills civilians
6742209 the worst thing is that there are no signs of an opening or dialogue
6742210 fifty years after nigers independence tuaregs no longer accept others running their affairs for them weve had enough of being dominated
6742211 it will be much harder for mccain to paint obama as surrendering or wanting to cut and run since his withdrawal plan is very close to what bush and the iraqi government have agreed on
6742212 the united states has agreed to remove combat troops from iraqi cities by next june and from the rest of the country by the end of 2011 if conditions in iraq remain relatively stable according to iraqi and american officials involved in negotiating a security accord governing american forces there
6742213 u s and iraqi negotiators have now also agreed to a conditions based withdrawal of u s combat troops by the end of 2011 a date further in the future than the iraqis initially wanted the deal would leave tens of thousands of u s troops inside iraq in supporting roles such as military trainers for an unspecified time according to the u s military there are 144 000 u s troops in iraq most of whom are playing a combat role
6742214 taking an active interest in building infrastructure strengthening teledensity of the country leaving behind a vibrant media and fighting for pakistan as a soldier
6742215 had i kept myself above my country i would have made some other announcement
6742216 strengthened its safe haven in pakistans federally administered tribal area by deepening its alliances with pakistani militants
6742217 now has many of the operational and organizational advantages it once enjoyed across the border in afghanistan albeit on a smaller and less secure scale
6742218 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6742219 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6742220 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6742221 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6742222 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6742223 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6742224 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6742225 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6742226 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6742227 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6742228 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6742229 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6742230 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6742231 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6742232 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6742233 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6742234 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6742235 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6742236 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6742237 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6742238 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6742239 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6742240 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6742241 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6742242 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6742243 de mensen die ssl waarschuwingen het hardste nodig hebben zijn onervaren gebruikers zij zullen de foutmelding van firefox 3 waarschijnlijk niet snappen en de site direct verlaten
6742244 mozilla beperkt het gebruik van ssl op deze manier voor mensen die bereid zijn om te betalen voor een certificaat dat afkomstig is van n van de uitgevers die bij het bedrijf als betrouwbaar te boek staat dit is een slechte ontwikkeling voor uitgevers en het web in zn geheel
6742245 waren dit soort aanvallen ooit onderdeel van bangmakende fictieverhalen maar tegenwoordig is het een kwestie van een paar keer klikken om zon aanval uit te voeren het enige dat je cht kan vertellen of de sites die je bezoekt echt zijn is de aanwezigheid van een betrouwbaar certificaat die alleen de site zelf heeft
6742246 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6742247 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6742248 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6742249 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6742250 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6742251 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6742252 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6742253 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6742254 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6742255 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6742256 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6742257 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6742258 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6742259 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6742260 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6742261 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6742262 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6742263 we are looking for a long term future for the bandstand
6742264 the concerts on sunday afternoons are incredibly well attended and it is a wonderful memorial to the bandsmen
6742265 we are looking to raise 30 000 plus for the refurbishment of the bandstand and to put into a trust fund for future maintenance
6742266 we have to check the ground but meydan city is in good form and is working well
6742267 he won his last two races and is ready to go it will be a big step for him going into a group two but the horse is improving all the time
6742268 i think the step up in trip will suit him

6742271 oltre al fatto che la musica house deriva molto probabilmente dal connubio fra un trapano impazzito e un sub che affoga il truzzo possiede una carenza intellettiva del concetto di ego che gli impedisce totalmente di vivere pensare o agire autonomamente
6742272 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6742273 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6742274 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6742275 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6742276 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6742277 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6742278 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6742279 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6742280 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6742281 its about keeping john mccain from sweeping the south thats the key
6742282 the economy and national security are neck and neck for me
6742283 in fact im not even sure they are separate issues
6742284 i just havent really understood what mccains position is on that but it needs to be controlled
6742285 senator obama has a great deal of work to do if he plans to turn the southern states in his favor
6742286 for older americans i think color is still an issue
6742287 i hate to knock on the color thing i really do
6742288 i really think whoever is elected it will be good for america
6742289 alkohol oh alkohol dass du mein feind bist wei ich wohl
6742290 he said he put it up in the air and the wind got hold of it and that was that
6742291 he drove around a few streets and left his name at a few houses went around a corner and hello here are all these police cars
6742292 being a typical kiwi he thought ill go and find out whats going on here wandered up and they told him about this helicopter crash
6742293 he said im looking for a helicopter but mines a model
6742294 it would have been nice to have a medal but im pretty privileged to already have one there are some insanely capable driven athletes who dont even make the final and as we saw with rower mahe drysdale so many different things that can happen
6742295 this is like a gold for me in a way given what ive had to overcome its just such a relief
6742296 i had some serious doubts and it would have been so easy to give in and not even line up
6742297 but i felt i gave myself the best opportunity my mental focus throughout the race was an accumulation of all my years of training experience and setbacks
6742298 physically i wasnt the best out there but mentally i think ive got something to look back on and feel proud about
6742299 the last four years ive worked really hard to push the boundaries on things and thats had consequences in dips in form and things ive tried to pull it back together and thats been more difficult than i imagined and then the confidence was really low
6742300 to pull out a final like that and get fourth i feel really proud of what i was able to produce
6742301 excuse me for all the cliches and all that sort of crap but its given me a different perspective given the state i was in so many times over the last four years i wanted to quit three times this year i was so close to quitting to get fourth i had to discover a lot
6742302 i was thinking i could sneak a gold mate but i was working really hard on keeping my head in my own boat i wanted to put as much physically into it as i was able to that was relfected with 100m to go when i got the wobbles and had a fair amount of lactate i knew i couldnt give it any more
6742303 hes been through some hard times that boy hes got a big heart and deserves it im really happy for him
6742304 the last four years have been just hammer hammer hammer you get taught the harder you work youll get there but theres a bit more to it than that and ive neglected other areas of my life its taken a toll and i need some time to recover and come back with a more healthy approach to the game
6742305 they have not been able to locate it on the premises and a letter drop has been done with the neighbours in the area
6742306 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6742307 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6742308 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6742309 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6742310 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6742311 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6742312 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6742313 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6742314 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6742315 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6742316 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6742317 i took a chance it didnt work out now i need to refocus and start the next chapter of my life
6742318 sorry about the pizza boss we swear we thought you had a slice
6742319 im not talking about the pizza when was it that we failed to finish a game
6742320 was it when i was ejected in clevelend milwaukee that time down in houston you guys just thought it was a good time to take the rest of the night off is that it
6742321 yeah a few of the guys played half a game of parcheesi on the plane
6742322 this week is all about having the right reaction to what happened last weekend
6742323 i saw things that i was pleased with some of our passing was crisp and incisive but we needed more of an end product and to have put the opposition under more pressure for longer periods and that is what we will be looking to do
6742324 it is key to get points on the board as quickly as possible because when that happens the focus on other issues fades away and people focus on the football
6742325 west ham got off to a good start last weekend and we are expecting an open enough game from my point of view i am looking for us to be nice and solid defensively with that platform and understanding that allows us to go on the front foot and dictate to the opposition
6742326 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6742327 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6742328 their expectations are pretty high but really they werent on the pitch at all its very difficult i dont know what to say
6742329 its been a massive experience for me something that i never saw coming
6742330 obviously i have to take a hard look at myself i cant stomach having that many losses i have to look at myself and my own coaching obviously it wasnt there for this tournament and maybe its not there at all
6742331 players that have been playing really well are missing traps holding on to the ball a fraction long and not moving it on our games based around moving the ball on and when you dont have that its not that much of a competition
6742332 i think gemma flynn has been a great find and it was good to see kayla sharland come through at the end lizzie igasan has had a very good tournament too
6742333 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6742334 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6742335 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6742336 no vamos a tener prisas fichar por fichar no lo vamos a hacer a d a de hoy no nos hemos planteado el traer a alguien aun no nos hemos reunido para decidirlo
6742337 tenemos tres delanteros espec ficos y algunos otros que se pueden desenvolver como segundo punta como renato y acosta

6742340 ever since ive been here ive wondered when we were going to get things going our way it seems like it was never our way

6742344 one of the reasons scotland didnt take to lady thatcher was because of that
6742345 we didnt mind the economic side so much but we didnt like the social side at all
6742346 margaret thatcher could have only ever read the penguin edition of wealth of nations and she missed out the moral sentiments
6742347 im well on the record as never having approved of either margaret thatchers social or economic policies thats clear if you look at the interview
6742348 i was commenting on why scots in particular were so deeply resentful of margaret thatcher and i strongly believe that her social message of no such thing as society and the poll tax cut against the grain of scotlands social conscience
6742349 that doesnt mean that the nation liked her economic policies just that we liked her social policies even less
6742350 i have never approved of either margaret thatchers economic or social policies as is clear from the very next passage of the full interview where i say that if scottish economic founder adam smith could sue for the misuse of his thoughts by thatcherites they would be in real trouble
6742351 really what the students are asking for is a refund 1000 each
6742352 theyve made every attempt to deal with it but have only received a miserable response from management
6742353 obviously the students are upset and we sincerely apologise for that
6742354 when we found out the students were upset we stopped the work and will only be doing noisy work during the holidays from now on
6742355 thank you were so excited obviously weve been through it before its all good its great im really excited
6742356 oh im not pregnant i just had a lot of carbs for breakfast its just what do they call it a breakfast pouch bunch
6742357 it always makes me laugh when people say is she isnt she its like eventually you will know so just chill out for a minute
6742358 motorcycles and scooters are exempt from payment of parking fees at all on street parking meters and pay and display machines during the times of operation
6742359 moped and scooter operators are permitted to chain their vehicle to poles and bicycle racks to ensure the safety of their property motorcycles are not permitted to do the same
6742360 but if theyre out there for other reasons they will look at all infractions including scooters that are plated and parked on the sidewalk and they will be fined
6742361 if a safety concern exists and or the scooter moped is obstructing vehicular or pedestrian traffic parking enforcement officers can issue an infraction
6742362 there is plenty of room for them to park on the road
6742363 if we dont make it convenient for you and encourage the use of scooters or motorcycles people will go from bicycles to cars
6742364 wed rather have people go from a bicycle to a scooter when theyre 55 or 60 years old than buy an suv
6742365 when parking is restricted from a sidewalk it is enforced through the authority of a municipal bylaw
6742366 we thought it would be good if you only had to draw your edit once and the software propagate the information from that single edit through the whole video
6742367 there are professional tools that can do these kind of edits but its an incredibly skilled procedure we believe that with this procedure anyone should be able to edit video
6742368 grazie a dio il mio amico putin mi ha ascoltato altrimenti col cavolo che i carri armati russi si sarebbero fermati a quindici chilometri da tbilisi abbiamo evitato un inutile bagno di sangue
6742369 the defendant has been observed walking up and down the parking lot of the park del mar apartments complex in tampa wearing his uniform and carrying a ceremonial sword apparently practicing parade drills
6742370 he does receive a lot of items in the name of other people but cannot explain why
6742371 without any reasonable basis for the stock increase except to lure new investors and mollify existing investors into the false belief that nopec stock was rising
6742372 youve got to use it especially at the olympic games
6742373 we dont have any regrets we crossed the line and were totally spent you cant ask for more than that
6742374 we perhaps need more racing under that pressure so when youre against the top crews you can find an extra gear
6742375 judging by how he paddled his semi i think he can go very well the 500 is probably the most competitive race at the games you saw adam van koeverden absolutely bomb out in the 1000 earlier today
6742376 hes going to be a man possessed in that 500 and im picking hes going to get out in front and lead the whole way
6742377 so steves just going to have to pace his own race like he did in the semi and hes definitely in with a shot
6742378 his claim of experiencing anxiety and depression is borne out not only in his verbal report but in his test results
6742379 it is the single most common symptom of child sexual abuse
6742380 about 69 percent of that population report exactly the same symptom which is extremely rare in the general population
6742381 you dont know if his memory that his problems in school was concurrent with the abuse is accurate or not is that right
6742382 he said it was not a big deal and seemed weird and that at the time he just wanted to get on with his life thats a far cry from a vietnam veteran reliving a war experience isnt it
6742383 he would grab and touch me in spots you know where it wasnt right to be touched
6742384 hes doing great wouldnt you 60 million richer hes doing wonderful
6742385 if the communication bit rate falls below a certain rate it can switch to another colour to see if the communication improves
6742386 we are here to stay and todays announcement is the latest evidence of our commitment
6742387 they set the stage by negotiating a labor agreement thats competitive with any in the united states
6742388 our dealers are asking for many more cobalts than we can build
6742389 the cobalt is a strong car but the cruze is going to be bigger it will offer better fuel economy and more features and so we hope we can see some opportunity on pricing
6742390 with the capital markets weve had fits and starts of opportunities but they havent opened up robustly i hope that happens soon but we cant bet on that

6742394 it made me feel so good to know that im working so hard
6742395 organized american jewry exerted utmost pressures on public opinion and politicians
6742396 day in and day out the press carried such headlines as the american jewish congress demands senator lehman again renews his plea to open up palestine congressman javits of manhattan suggests a congressional junket to palestine to foster the establishment of a jewish commonwealth the british empire building in radio center was picketed while william odwyer not yet a refugee in mexico excoriated the british before the national council of young israel zionists flooded the capitol with letters trying to link palestine with aid to greece and turkey tell the british some letters said there will be no aid for the british policy in greece and turkey unless they follow the united states lead on palestine the state and war departments it is true were constantly cautioning the white house and congress that an irresponsible vote chasing policy for palestine might irreparably damage the american position in one of the worlds most strategic areas but politicians when following the scent of blocs seem to be beyond the reach of reason at the climax of the palestine crisis at any rate elections were just around the corner they always seem to be in this blessed country of ours and both parties were convinced that their eloquent support of statehood for israel was a prerequisite for their conquest of pivotal states there was in fact no need for the zionists to refute the solemn warnings that were coming from the war and state departments all the zionists had to do was to make sure that the politicians remained hypnotized by the jewish vote perhaps for the first time in history a decisive battle could indeed be won with the tools of propaganda it is to the credit of the zionists acumen that they grasped their chance but it is perhaps less to the credit of americas non zionist jewry that it permitted its self appointed zionist leaders to bet the future of american judaism on the roulette of power politics
6742397 we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programmes
6742398 i like all fans of team usa am extremely disappointed with the performance of our relays
6742399 so far everything that has been received demonstrates we have no problem for the eligibility of the competitors
6742400 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6742401 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates

6742405 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands squad for the natwest series after careful consideration
6742406 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6742407 i decided to retire from englands odi team for a number reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family
6742408 drawing too many games at home was one of the reasons we didnt challenge for the title last season we cant lose so many points at home this season if we want to be up there
6742409 a lot of teams do the same by defending at anfield but we have to find the solution to make sure we win games like this
6742410 like i said before the dream is coming true this is fantastic
6742411 this is my scene the pressure was on me he has beaten me four times before and he is strong he has such raw strength
6742412 but i got through it my training my tactics were perfect it was all spot on
6742413 ive made it to the olympic final its unbelievable now i want to hear my national anthem and it will make me cry

6742420 the heavy rain that produced as much as 5 to 6 inches of rain across jefferson county texas on wednesday will return today
6742421 an additional 1 to 2 inches of rain will be common with isolated amounts of 5 inches possible
6742422 tropical storm fay is not expected to be over the gulf of mexico very long if at all on friday we will continue to monitor fay for any significant deviations to the forecast the most significant change to our forecast for this weekend is seeing a decrease in rain chances and hotter temperatures into the mid and upper 90s
6742423 the most significant issue regarding the slow motion is that fay will likely continue to dump torrential rains along its path and will probably be remembered as a very wet storm
6742424 the turn to the northwest and west northwest keeping fay over land is consistent with most of the computer models
6742425 looking at the state of the north american and european markets frankly its difficult to expect an improvement next year
6742426 the u s economy is weak but theres a feeling that itll be the first region to recover
6742427 in that sense the first auto stocks to bounce back will probably be the companies with a large exposure to north america like toyota
6742428 the companys plan calls for production to reverse a slide in the january march quarter but theres no guarantee that demand wont slide further
6742429 whats commendable about toyota is that its continuously sowing the seeds for future growth
6742430 we continue to take a positive view of the future growth potential suggested by toyotas strengths in environmental technologies such as hybrid vehicles
6742431 you are underage and get caught with booze on campus your out of school
6742432 es un final tr gico para un programa en el que decenas de personas han puesto sus
6742433 ha dicho john dengate funcionario del servicio nacional de parques y vida salvaje a una radio australiana
6742434 es similar a cuando tienes una mascota familiar cuando el veterinario te dice no hay nada m s que podamos hacer y el animal est sufriendo yo tom la decisi n porque no quer a prolongar la agon a de este animal

6742437 weve had a good old ding dong off the lizard and going nowhere for the day but really enjoying it the boat is fantastic and we are slowly getting our sea legs its a shame we have had the wind on the nose all the time as we havent been able to see her at her best tide just turned foul so decided to pop into helford for the night and as you can see from the picture the sun has just come out and we have been able to go off the wind with everything up and i cant tell you how nice it is
6742438 long ago helford village was quite an important port this is difficult to believe today as one approaches the sleepy little place on the banks ofthe helford river trading ships once brought french rum tobacco and lace from the continent and the duty was collected at the old custom house during the napoleonic wars pirates and free traders populated the reaches of the river daphne du mauriers novel frenchmans creek tells the story of one of these this was her only romantic novel this could have something to do with the fact that she spent her honeymoon there
6742439 the army stopped a vehicle carrying these militants at the checkpost but they hurled grenades and opened fire at the soldiers

6742441 doesnt quite chime does it but thats where the economy had got to at the end of june and now its probably in the first quarter of what will turn out to be a recession couple that to eurozone holiday exchange rates and the rising cost of more or less everything and it must now
6742442 xbox is a natural partner to help us reach out to youth voters to realize our goal of registering 2 million young americans by this fall we need to go where young americans are and theres no doubt in our minds that many are on xbox 360 and xbox live
6742443 the xbox live community is active vocal and passionate were thrilled to partner with rock the vote to make it easier than ever for youth voters and our members to register and be heard
6742444 i really strongly believe in local bargaining but weve set this deadline because we dont want the uncertainty for school boards to go on forever
6742445 if we cant make an informal process work without it dragging on or getting nasty it will be extremely damaging to the relationship between boards and their employees
6742446 and were going to see a public call for legislated provincial bargaining
6742447 this kind of imposed deadline clearly violates the principles of free collective bargaining

6742490 i see hats off to you and sorry once again for that question it was just framed badly not intended that way
6742491 that is fine this is the pill society gives to victims of 498a the anti dowry law but i have no qualms in saying that i demanded dowry for if what i demanded amounts to dowry in todays era of woman protection and woman empowerment then so be it after all times are changing definitions of 1960 cannot work today

6742498 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him
6742499 putins role in the blatantly misleading information issued by the government about the chechnya offensive also has been criticized his talent for creating legends has been evident in his explanations about the war for example putin told the writers group that the military had been open with the news media when the military has in fact hidden information about casualties combat events attacks on civilians and its goals and methods

6742501 the story is a long complicated one winding its way from china to france by way of the first world war the oil cartel the pharmaceutical cartel and iraq to its final destination a syringe full of something claiming to be a vaccine against the newly deadly avian flu
6742502 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering
6742503 as a physician i understand a basic virological fact that the public has not been told it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist public relations efforts to the contrary if a vaccine is being made against the avian flu virus in its pandemic form that means the pandemic virus must already exist so the fact that the avian flu vaccine is already being manufactured in china by sanofi pasteur reported to be a wholly owned subsidiary of total petroleum a french arm of the cartel supports our contention that the weaponized avian flu already exists as we saw in the case of the anthrax scare of 2001 an allegedly disgruntled government employee can release deadly toxins from even the most secure government facility
6742504 publicly available information shows the pharmaceutical industry and us government are both actively preparing for an avian flu pandemic this is shown through their own promotional literature and propaganda
6742505 the whole notion of an avian flu pandemic occurring without technological intervention is highly questionable to date there have only been around 385 human cases of avian flu identified worldwide assuming those identifications are trustworthy of course with 243 deaths to put the absurdity of this effort into perspective sudden cardiac death scd which many researchers believe is heavily associated with aspartame consumption is a leading cause of death according to the cdc for example scd killed 460 000 americans in 1999 and the numbers keep rising but aspartame a product of monsanto is an approved substance while the currently non pandemic avian flu is the focus of hugely expensive seemingly irrational preparations if there is no intent to create that very pandemic
6742506 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it drums into us is the

6742557 on the way back to the city i was fearful of what i would see there but in reality tbilisi is pretty normal just quiet and sad

6742559 there are around 88 000 refugees in tbilisi they have fled the fighting in gori which is now an almost deserted city

6742598 we offer the chance to go on loan to any of the interested english clubs
6742599 i was informed that wigan want to sign me on loan but they are yet to contact middlesbrough
6742600 wigan coach steve bruce admires my abilities he has tried to sign me when he was in charge of birmingham and now he has renewed his interest
6742601 i will take my final decision next week after meeting middlesbrough coach gareth southgate
6742602 i may opt to stay at middlesbrough for the sake of stability i settled in there after spending a whole season with them
6742603 anyway i wont close the door on a move to wigan i may end up joining them if they offered me more first team football
6742604 they have about eight players who are 62 plus so that makes them big
6742605 i think that if youre big you cant not get away with being physical you cant have a 62 namby pamby it would be pointless in football they are big and they are physical and that leads to people saying that they will be crash bang wallop and iain dowie has never been that type of player or that type of manager or coach and i think that is a bit harsh if that is the kind of take they get
6742606 theyve got one or two skillful players and a couple of foreigners that they have brought in and its a case of merging the two you need the physical strength in the english league but you also need guile qpr on paper look to be a well balanced side
6742607 it was good to see them in action and obviously the likes of rowly and hogan are in my thoughts ahead of the doncaster game
6742608 from the moment we conceded our first goal it was an uphill task
6742609 of course its disappointing we planned all week long and within a couple of minutes we were behind
6742610 goals change games and they came out the blocks really well and we did the complete opposite
6742611 weve only got ourselves to blame but football being football weve got the chance to put the wrongs of that display to right against doncaster
6742612 without any shadow of doubt we need to bounce back
6742613 we let ourselves and our fans down on saturday so now is the time to respond
6742614 it is getting better every day and things are looking good now
6742615 it has been very frustrating because after getting through pre season i thought i might have turned a corner
6742616 i am still confident but half of the time i feel like a broken down car i never know if i am going to start in the morning or not
6742617 some of my friends say i am cursed but i dont believe that
6742618 it has just been rotten luck and i am just hoping that is about to go away for good
6742619 there is nothing you can do about injuries when you play the game fully committed then there is a chance you are going to get hurt
6742620 there is always a bit of a hangover period after you suffer a relegation
6742621 one or two players think that they wont have to do too much to win promotion at the first attempt but that is easier said than done
6742622 it is difficult to get the consistency and there are a lot of subconscious negatives because of relegation the season before
6742623 they have experienced championship players and they look as though they want to play football in the right way
6742624 its a simple conversion from a loan deal to a permanent contract for a year it frees up a loan space
6742625 jerome could have been recalled by charlton in january under the terms of his loan but thats no longer a factor now his deal has been made permanent
6742626 im very surprised i have been with mikael basically all the time ive been in the first team squad
6742627 he is a great professional and it is sad to see him go but he has not been playing many games at the moment and he wants to play so all the best to him
6742628 if he wants to go im sure it will be good for him as long as he is happy with it and plays games
6742629 it is rare to move from manchester united to arsenal but if you are going to go anywhere why not go to a good team and im sure thats what mikael will be thinking

6742636 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6742637 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6742638 while he is still here he is very much 100 a tottenham player that is how we consider things
6742639 it is not a case of finding a solution to a problem before it occurs
6742640 maybe at times i am a bit too honest and at club level the manager is telling me not to defend too much to try and save some energy for when we are attacking
6742641 but sometimes you just want to win the ball back and work hard for the team that is just how i play maybe it does affect my goals tally but hopefully i can learn and get better
6742642 i know its a bit short notice and i am sorry for that but well thats just the way it is

6742647 it was clear this election was going to be about change
6742648 people were ready to turn the page for a new approach to politics i felt as though senator obama spoke to that longing in ways no other candidate did
6742649 i think it gave senator obama great credibility early on in the community of heavyweight fundraisers and political activists
6742650 hillary got the top three tiers of people in terms of staff and members of congress and surrogates
6742651 edwards got the fourth tier barack got the fifth tier with a couple notable exceptions wexler was that exception
6742652 i was convinced then and im even more convinced now that senator obamas staunch support for israel and his compelling case to directly engage in diplomacy with iran for the purpose of thwarting irans nuclear ambition and stopping their financial support for terror was the most pro israel position that a presidential candidate could take
6742653 its not just money its the fact that theyre both involved in jewish charities and pro israel activities
6742654 theyre a seal of good housekeeping as far as chicago jews are concerned with baracks bona fides
6742655 when he was running for congress and later on for the senate i would help organize fundraisers for him on the north shore which had been my congressional district and along the lakefront in chicago a lot of people who came to those were jewish
6742656 its a part of the yiddishkheit we grew up with to be a liberal
6742657 i was fascinated from the first time i saw him with jewish constituents at how easily they got along with him how much they liked him and were drawn to him and how well he answered questions particularly on israel
6742658 the obama campaign is reaching out aggressively to the jewish community through the creation of jewish community leadership councils in cities around the country and dan joins national jewish vote director eric lynn to augment and expand this outreach effort
6742659 i immediately saw he was the kind of person youd like to see as the president of the u s

6742665 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6742666 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6742667 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6742679 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is no effort without error or shortcoming but who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself for a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat

6742691 the candidate republicans should be clamoring for is the one liberals are most feverishly denouncing that is mitt romney by a landslide
6742692 he just tripped off a chair he was getting ready to speak somebody aimed a gun at him and him he dove for the floor
6742693 prominent evangelical leaders are warning sen john mccain against picking former massachusetts gov mitt romney as his running mate saying their troops will abandon the republican ticket on election day if that happens
6742694 they say mr romney lacks trust on issues such as outlawing abortion and opposing same sex marriage and because he is a mormon opposition is particularly powerful among those who supported former arkansas gov mike huckabee in the republican presidential primaries earlier this year
6742695 other well placed christian conservatives say that although many evangelical leaders could accept and work for a mccain romney ticket mr huckabees supporters tend to be rabid in their views against mr romney because of his faith they do not regard mormonism as a christian denomination
6742696 i am wholeheartedly convinced that mitt romney can be trusted to uphold the values and principles most important to me as a political conservative and an evangelical christian again i am not being paid and i am not interested in a job in a romney administration i would not accept one even if offered as im still raising three teenagers neither is my public relations firm involved in any way i am involved because i believe the stakes are high perhaps higher than ever before in my life

6742706 worst food inflation in 17 years the demand for enthanol products ramped up over the past year and a half corn prices have doubled in the last year

6742708 statement 2 some 47 million americans do not have health insurance this number from the census bureau is often cited as evidence that the health system is failing for many american families yet by masking tremendous heterogeneity in personal circumstances the figure exaggerates the magnitude of the problem to start with the 47 million includes about 10 million residents who are not american citizens many are illegal immigrants even if we had national health insurance they would probably not be covered the number also fails to take full account of medicaid the governments health program for the poor for instance it counts millions of the poor who are eligible for medicaid but have not yet applied these individuals who are healthier on average than those who are enrolled could always apply if they ever needed significant medical care they are uninsured in name only the 47 million also includes many who could buy insurance but havent the census bureau reports that 18 million of the uninsured have annual household income of more than 50 000 which puts them in the top half of the income distribution about a quarter of the uninsured have been offered employer provided insurance but declined coverage of course millions of americans have trouble getting health insurance but they number far less than 47 million and they make up only a few percent of the population of 300 million any reform should carefully focus on this group to avoid disrupting the vast majority for whom the system is working we do not nationalize an industry simply because a small percentage of the work force is unemployed similarly we should be wary of sweeping reforms of our health system if they are motivated by the fact that a small percentage of the population is uninsured

6742734 instead of seeing if theres a way of stimulating the economy mccain lieberman would depress the economy his plan calls for a new financial burden to be placed on people who are purchasing gasoline or for that matter natural gas to heat their homes or to cook in their homes the energy information agency has said that his plan would cost america 300 000 jobs in addition people would pay they estimate approximately 50 cents per gallon more for gasoline and 20 more for their gas utility bill that would depress the economy just at a time when were trying to stimulate the economy
6742735 one of the challenges with having a president who in this case were talking in this case a presidential candidate who says on repeated occasion that he doesnt understand the economy terribly well is that he would suggest a policy that would actually depress the economy rather than stimulate it at the very time we need our economy to have a greater boost

6742777 we are pleased to be able to offer the airs system at a significant discount with free training to nlc and iafc members
6742778 based on the interest we generated during the webcast we want to insure we make the airs system economically accessible to all municipalities and fire chiefs wishing to deploy airs and its life saving features
6742779 the airs system has the capability to save lives and allow first responders to more efficiently manage their resources while providing a level of situational awareness not achieved prior to the use of this technology
6742780 it is critical that new technologies be applied in the fire service to help us help our own if they get trapped
6742781 if you can enable a rapid intervention team rit with the technology to find a downed firefighter with precision youve given them a fighting chance at reaching them in time to save one of their own there can be nothing more important to a firefighter than saving one of our own
6742782 we are pleased to be able make cities aware of this promising new technology through nlc tv
6742783 city officials are always looking for new solutions to e protect first responders in the line of duty
6742784 this technology was originally developed for the us dept of defenses
6742785 now that its being adopted by commercial companies for tracking and monitoring the status of shipments the price has dropped dramatically so that it can be deployed at a reasonable cost the lives of our first responders are invaluable so now that the price is reasonable we want cities to be able to take advantage of these advances in networked people trackers and sensors
6742786 we had significant traffic for this nlc tv webcast including viewership from the first responder community and fire chiefs nationally
6742787 the airs system is attracting a lot of attention across the country as we continue to see growing traffic to the video archive of the webcast over the last several weeks becomes more viral in the community

6742878 we think markets will remain volatile in the coming weeks in the absence of moving factors and the advent of month of ramadan

6742890 we delivered a very respectable second quarter performance despite the impacts of significant macroeconomic softness and a deteriorating consumer environment both of which continue to weigh on the retail sector our relentless focus on inventory management and expense control along with our share repurchase program enabled us to deliver earnings per share that exceeded year ago
6742891 our focus in this difficult environment continues to be on managing the business prudently and investing in strengthening our brands to position the company for success when the economy improves we are highly focused on evolving and modernizing the ann taylor brand maximizing the potential of loft and growing our factory and internet channels in terms of our outlook for the balance of the year we expect conditions to remain challenging to mitigate the anticipated softness in consumer spending which is likely to continue to pressure our top line we have planned our business accordingly concentrating on managing our expenses and inventories thus despite these challenges we are reiterating our previous guidance of diluted earnings per share for the year to be in the range of 1 80 1 90

6742893 nuri will be rather close to hong kong this afternoon and tonight with a chance of a direct hit
6742894 it may be necessary to issue higher signals this afternoon
6742895 the airlines should have broadcast the latest typhoon news in the airport and made arrangements for us to stay somewhere its the first time ive come to hong kong and now i have no idea what to do here
6742896 we are fortunate that the competition finished before typhoon nuri hit hong kong
6742897 the reason premiums have dropped is life insurance is now based on the new 2001 cso mortality tables and those mortality tables show that people are living longer so that when companies are calculating the cost of insurance from a mortality standpoint they can charge a lesser amount

6742909 he felt really lonely and he wanted to be with his mother and family
6742910 it was suffering extremely so weve had to make the very difficult decision
6742911 our position on the issue is that a resolution should be tabled in the parliament on monday and after a debate of two days it should be passed on wednesday followed by the reinstatement of judges the same day
6742912 we certainly do not desire to part away we want the coalition to remain intact
6742913 but the restoration of judges should take place within the next week

6742929 rogge who is 66 and competed in the olympics as a yachtsman three times between 1968 and 1976 suddenly sounded like a very old man
6742930 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
6742931 of course whatever your views on bolts conduct its hard to listen to the chief of an organisation as ethically bankrupt as the international olympic committee delivering lectures on good behaviour and corinthian ideals
6742932 its one thing for the chinese government to jail dissidents to forge the passports of underage gymnasts and to set up official protest zones and then arrest anyone who applied to use them
6742933 these are matters that i met with disciplined silence or as i so adroitly put it with quiet diplomacy
6742934 it stands out that such observations have been made on of all people the man who has spiced up the games the most and who has put on a display of sublime athletic prowess
6742935 the games problem does not lie in their geopolitical dimension rogge says
6742936 nor in the velvet alibi that beijings tyranny has been granted
6742937 the problem rogge says lies in the fact that bolts tribal dance could be perceived as an offence to his rivals
6742938 the only person who could possibly have been offended was a belgian bureaucrat who has done some good things during his time at the head of the ioc but would have done well to bite his tongue on this occasion and let youth have its day

6742948 he set the bar so high now everyone wants a gold medal
6742949 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6742950 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6742951 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6742952 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6742953 the number of us military bases would depend on the size and the needs of the troops
6742954 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6742955 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6742956 its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
6742957 if i dont get to a pole or a chair i dont have a lot of options for steady travel
6742958 undermine the very thing youre trying to promote by getting them hooked on the rewards
6742959 still a work in progress and may not reflect final product
6742960 wow that blew i hate this game i need to tell everyone else in the wolrd how much this sucks
6742961 he shows us the beauty to be seen and gives us eyes to see it
6742962 bars can be a good occasional source of nutrients such as protein for people on the go but they vary dramatically in their content before eating a bar a consumer should be sure it has what he or she needs without unwanted ingredients
6742963 i am planning on it but now it almost has to be like an event when i see it
6742964 the way i specifically tackled some of the songs really shocked him i think
6742965 as gabe described it to me the original soundtrack which he really deeply loves is for him this self obsessed self aggrandizing teenage epic love thing
6742966 he felt like i was actually doing something similar in doveman songs but in this bizarrely inward turned way
6742967 i feel like its probably a good entryway for people into my music just because i know its a pretty challenging album
6742968 it doesnt yield up its secrets on first listen whats been interesting is the best reactions ive gotten to that record have been recently people whove had it for six months they listened to it once and eh not quite for them and they listen to it again and get more and more into it
6742969 its exactly what you need between the hours of 1 and 4 in the morning alone unable to sleep with a drink
6742970 he can play a lot of different ways and he has his own way of playing too which we like
6742971 eventually what made me do it is that i really really wanted to write songs and i didnt feel like writing songs for other people
6742972 in very specific settings if there is a microphone in front of me i will sing if someone asks me how does that song go again i wont sing it even if its my own song
6742973 the other thing that i dont do is dance so there actually will be no cutting footloose for me
6742974 why japan is the slanty eyed menace that we should fear and ridicule
6742975 why japan is the slanty eyed menace that we should fear and ridicule
6742976 make a bunch of work for a fancy gallery show so you can make a living
6742977 its our goal to make pop songs as perfect as they do
6742978 was anyone at the lucksmiths show wanna start a band like that
6742979 we wanted it to be two boys two girls but shannon had a girls name so we thought that would do
6742980 were fine with the twee thing it is twee pop
6742981 i know some people use the term negatively but we like it
6742982 after pulaski park we really wanted to work with them again
6742983 but we knew wed need to do a bigger run their fanbase was growing and their songs were only getting better were dead proud of having put secret party out
6742984 musically they hit a lot of my soft spots the alternate vocals the handclaps ukuleles jangly guitars kazoo solos lyrics that make you smile
6742985 they just know how to get a load of good ingredients and turn them into amazing songs
6742986 which is a shame because thats where the money is
6742987 sometimes when i want to play a drum kit i hop onto theirs
6742988 i just want to play music thats uncomplicated i dont want the drama and the attitude
6742989 i was just too scared to that band was so
6742990 this idea of us as happy and twee and cute misses the point of some of these songs they are quite sad
6742991 there was a real chance element to seeing where these songs would go
6742992 but that seems like a neat parallel with the genesis of these songs theres no single author there were no tape recorders and accidents played such a big role in how people learned them theres a real mystery to it
6742993 its totally unclear how this little experiment is going to go
6742994 its not like we all get together and it feels like one aesthetic its more like different lines of connection that may not intersect all three of us at once but they add up to something theres an ease and a quickness and a sort of shimmering consistency to our sound context we rehearsed for four hours total nobody is scared
6742995 i think he can so successfully combine experimental music with what he learned growing up with us because he really understands tradition
6742996 he gets under and around the songs hell change a melody and the harmonies are quirky but theyre always right because he knows where it came from
6742997 sams contribution is less about instrumentation than his sensibilities as a person
6742998 he brings a hodgepodge of outsider expressions that go well beyond folk music and really gets that the music isnt as much a performance as a coming together not so much a blending into one harmonious whole as a collection of personalities
6742999 even though were in new york now theres been an awareness of trying to create the kind of feeling we had in vermont
6743000 im lucky to have encountered it and to be making it happen in the city
6743001 in classical music the concert experience is this very formalized thing
6743002 you dress up nicely you might shower before you go its a special effort and the space is usually gorgeous with this kind of tour theres an idea that the music is a continuum of the day and a more social interaction than not this tour is more about staying on peoples floors and peoples couches and being more casual about what it means to make music
6743003 ive been watching nico for a couple of years now
6743004 he comes from the classical world but he really gets the emotional quality of these musicians this is the first time hes done a tour like this and theres this feeling that this is a very unique thing we may not be seeing much in the future
6743005 muhlys career has been a pursuit to figure out what comes after every rule has already been broken
6743006 you go to the phils website and first it looks like a tampax ad and then the programming is a disaster
6743007 he jumped at the chance to have his music played by the pops
6743008 he was so refreshing willing to jump into whatever interests him hes not limiting himself
6743009 every six months i think of a new way to describe it
6743010 it sounds like what happens if you squeeze the air out of something its the very last sound that comes out the only reason you can hear it is because its heavily amplified to me its as if you play a pump organ and you let your foot off the pedal his voice is definitely an interesting thing and its something you have to reckon with
6743011 for the most part setting the mood is about seeing where the audience wants to go
6743012 you can usually tell if going into a 16 minute long solo viola piece thats very dire is going to be appropriate at any moment then you do three fast really prepared piano pieces or you stick the viola piece at the beginning of the second half for me the fun of this thing is that in a normal situation i have to have committed to the order years in advance this for me is very liberating in not knowing

6743021 on friday august 22 at 6 00 am local time 0200 gmt all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia

6743024 russian peacekeeping soldiers in numbers required to ensure security will remain within the limits of the security zone at specially installed posts
6743025 in the phone call president bush said that the united states is looking for russian compliance with the agreement to withdraw their forces and an end to their siege of georgia
6743026 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6743027 unfortunately were not cool enough to run on your os yet we really wish we had a version of photosynth that worked cross platform but for now it only runs on windows trust us as soon as we have a mac version ready it will be up and available on our site

6743030 we will definitely try our outmost to ensure that they will not pull out because we have promised to work together to serve the country
6743031 if they want to do something in haste they have all the right to do that we cannot force them to be with us but we are trying to reach a consensus
6743032 discussions will continue but it must be on terms reasonable to all groups
6743033 our williams sponsorship provides us with a global platform that allows us to demonstrate our global networking capabilities and create the right type of brand association
6743034 while a u s gp would allow us to demonstrate our capabilities in an additional market the primary focus of our sponsorship is to support our global business units
6743035 it is unlikely that we would be involved with the sport at the same level if we were a company with only u s based interests

6743044 appointed by the home office in june 2007 to provide application support for tracking prolific and other priority offenders through the criminal justice system
6743045 data from the police national computer containing personal information about 33 000 individuals with six or more recordable convictions in the last 12 months names addresses and dates of birth data relating to approximately 10 000 prolific and other priority offenders names and dates of birth but not addresses data relating to all 84 000 prisoners in england and wales names dates of birth and in some cases expected prison release date and date of home detention curfew and drug interventions programme data with offenders initials but not full names
6743046 deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6743047 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels
6743048 it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
6743049 device control policies that enforce assigned permissions to individuals and devices
6743050 it is about putting the eyes of the management team on peoples pcs after all if people know they are being watched they are more likely to think again
6743051 guidance measures such as the payment cards industry directive are successful because they provide effective and comprehensive methodology to protect data and they are enforced

6743061 the level of service to the citizens will continue at a high state the way it is now
6743062 a workshop to help highway safety agencies counter any effort in their states to lower the drinking age
6743063 it was clear to me that they didnt see this as a dialogue they saw this as some kind of effort on our part to turn our schools into party schools
6743064 why would you take the one thing that has been tried in the last 30 years that has been shown to be most successful and throw that out the window and say i have a better idea
6743065 said alexander c wagenaar an epidemiologist at the college of medicine at the university of florida
6743066 many of our university presidents are doing as good a job as they can at enforcing the drinking age
6743067 theyre doing all the right things and what is the result well young people are moving beyond the view of the college officials and often beyond the boundaries of the college campuses and campus officials have no authority there
6743068 i think theres a direct connection between this law and this pattern of secret fast consumption of high octane alcohol its much more dangerous than the traditional great big loud keg party because it happens quietly out of view
6743069 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our education leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
6743070 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on under age and binge drinking policies
6743071 from freshman year on i hardly ever went out on the weekends without having four or five shots of vodka beforehand
6743072 youve got to preload before you get to a bar because you cant drink once you go in i definitely drink a lot less now that im 21 and so do all my friends
6743073 do they have any blacks in idaho they dont have many
6743074 those who know me and my record are well aware of my commitment to raising student achievement and to providing safe and orderly schools for all of our students
6743075 the naacp certainly is aware of these efforts because we have involved them in some of our most significant efforts to ensure that our discipline policies are impartial and clear and in the best interest of all students
6743076 the naacp should focus on things that concern the black community like single parent households these are the things that breed issues and problems whether or not wilbanks comments could be misconstrued as racist is not the problem
6743077 there are blacks everywhere just like there are whites everywhere
6743078 why would he say something like that if this was indiana the state she relocated from parents would have been in the parking lot with picket signs demanding that he resign immediately he is not even acknowledging that the comments could be taken offensively
6743079 the report we reviewed reflects a national problem that must be solved locally for the benefit of boys and girls and all ethnic groups
6743080 we cannot rest until all students are achieving not serving detention or expulsion
6743081 since idaho was statistically unusual the number of black students would be relevant in deciding whether idaho had something to teach us
6743082 my first question in my mind was what was idaho doing that was different mr wilbanks was doing the same thing he went a step ahead and was asking the question would the numbers be large enough for us to rally behind the assumption that the regularity of discipline referrals are any different from anyone elses
6743083 the issue for me isnt whether or not the students should be disciplined
6743084 what im looking for is equity and fairness in meting out discipline
6743085 the bottom line is that studies show that african american students are not only punished more often they are punished with harsher penalties
6743086 we dont know exactly why its happening but it shows up when we look at the numbers there are lots of inequities in our society its only one generation ago that we had the civil rights movement we cant expect that all of these residual effects are gong to be eliminated from a social setting like schools

6743097 by 2010 16 million of us will be living alone how many of us will die that way too
6743098 smash and break and burn every rich we can find
6743099 the correct use of the apostrophe was as alien to him as sanskrit
6743100 i am really not a bit happy unless i am writing even a letter will do
6743101 only does two things really well shout above rain and wind and stand with his legs apart
6743102 i hate the work now honestly during my fifth simulated orgasm on the film with cavani in rome the night porter i suddenly wondered what the hell i was doing at 53 with my back on the floor my flies undone being straddled by beloved miss rampling
6743103 miss jackson surely a plain girl with feet like a goat herd hands like a bricklayer bad teeth has an inner magnificence i have only ever seen matched by edith evans
6743104 the worst thing is the loneliness i suffer in utter silence from friday evening until monday
6743105 letters i think unless they are brilliant can be a bit of a bore and mine are not brilliant amusing perhaps light and loving but they aint intellectual
6743106 there is a real shift from television to the internet
6743107 and the most exciting aspect is a multi platform way of telling stories and the best part of that is when it cross pollinates when you create a story exclusively online but then it folds back onto the show and vice versa
6743108 when i first started i thought of heroes as taking up as big a footprint as i possibly could but that wasnt about selling stuff to people
6743109 this kind of drama feeds off its social currency social currency is about fandom and how much knowledge you have of the show that you love
6743110 the idea is to create a currency for the people who are true fans of the show a casual viewer may only watch heroes on television but if viewers go to the other platforms theyll know one more thing about the show than their friends
6743111 heroes couldnt have existed without shows such as lost and 24
6743112 but by coming along after those shows we got to look back at how the audience reacted and avoid some of their pitfalls
6743113 one of the big lessons was not to posit an ending heroes isnt about getting off an island like lost it does not have a finality to it so it lends itself to spinning in many different directions
6743114 took too long to get to the big picture story
6743115 be the most intense the scariest the most thrilling heroes can be right from the very start
6743116 serialised tv dramas are extremely challenging to make and to watch
6743117 they take commitment from an audience i think the way for them to survive is for them to be something rare and something special you do this by not being on the air all of the time and by having fewer episodes a show like heroes has to be an event
6743118 you only hope to have that kind of success and longevity
6743119 the truth is that heroes has been devised to have an open ended quality by positing the idea that superheroes are appearing all over the world with different abilities it is a never ending storyline
6743120 we talked to the ioc yesterday and we have already submitted documents every athlete is completely documented
6743121 the foreign media keeps asking about it and it really makes us upset and affected our preparation for the games
6743122 chinas team is very strong compared with the american team thats why they keep asking
6743123 im 16 people who know me know i am 16 what more do i have to say
6743124 no fancy equipment is required to read the data array once it is unlocked
6743125 it would be a rush if it wasnt ready i suppose but in terms of the recording we finished it in late june early july but the way media can be disseminated these days we figured if its finished then its ready to be heard i think certainly if wed decided to go the other route the cd being the first thing people heard i think we would have had to have a conversation about how we might tackle that this time around obviously the internet is such a tool for people so a lot of people dont think twice about going online to try and find music so why not use that to your advantage i suppose
6743126 we had one foot on each island as it were and in a way we were trying to remember whats been the heart of what we do
6743127 if anything with the second record there was a bit of a compromise behind it in that we were trying to marry up the two elements and not quite landing on either sort of level i suppose so why not just take it a bit further in each direction and actually follow it through a bit further
6743128 i think we just wanted to revisit some of the ways of working wed enjoyed and be a bit more choosy about where we split the various talents of those two guys and marry it up with the songs we had at that point
6743129 its a bit more disjointed in terms of the continuity it was just a different approach but im not sure if it was better or worse just a different attack and one that suited this record
6743130 when we recorded it we just tried to get the songs sounding as good as they possibly could and there are two songs wed never recorded that are on this record
6743131 we had talked about doing another record and theres another record on the table under our contract with metal blade we can do it if we want if we dont whatever but we have discussed doing another record and im kind of excited about tinkering with ideas for it that said if we did start writing a new album and it wasnt turning out like an overcast record i dont think wed put it out it really needs to have a certain vibe it cant be another metalcore record like the things that are going on these days it really needs to have that old school mentality which we had held true back then if not its not even worth it
6743132 we didnt want to change it too much and we didnt want it to sound like a different band
6743133 at the same time we didnt want to give fans the exact same record but we did want it to feel like the same band some of the stuff was recorded the way wed played the songs live because when youve played something 100 000 times you end up tweaking it changing it slightly so the new album reflects some of the older songs and how we used to play them live back then
6743134 im one of those dudes who needs to write constantly because i really suck at writing music with a deadline
6743135 my brain gets fried and i cant do anything i just shut down completely when we start on this next one well just bring our demos to practice and well listen to them judge them and start rearranging the parts that need to be rearranged or we just start jamming on what sounds cool
6743136 has at least one blast beat and very fast drumming with really slow riffs
6743137 it could be really not fun for me but thats something to consider
6743138 doctors have advised joey to stay off his leg for four to six weeks to prevent further injury or permanent and more serious damage
6743139 we know you will be hugely disappointed and so are we canceling shows is never an easy decision and we apologize to all our fans friends and family for not being there to throw down with you
6743140 seeing your friend collapse like that is something that nobody wants to experience
6743141 winds of plague as individuals have been hit very hard recently by a very selfish act committed by our longtime drummer jeff tenney
6743142 we are disgusted and very disappointed in his actions and are currently on the search for a new drummer
6743143 its a huge part of my life its tough to think beyond that but at some point im going to have to
6743144 i have some stuff going through my head but its going to stay there
6743145 its been an intense and hard couple of years and i think i need some time before i take the next step
6743146 its hard because i dont know whats going to come in my life when im going to start a family and all those things
6743147 obviously my husband and i are starting to think about the future and everything
6743148 probably since they were children theyve been known as the elite athlete and thats who they are at family barbecues
6743149 the goal will be to understand for themselves who they are now and celebrate the elite athlete part of their identity but also adding to it or shifting a little bit and more importantly communicating that to other people because networking accounts for probably 80 per cent of jobs people get
6743150 your coach tells you what to do when to wake up what you should be eating
6743151 its not easy but its easy in that you dont have to think for yourself very much and then youre out on your own you dont know how to apply your skills at all
6743152 i dove in a pool where i saw people go to the olympics and then become lifeguards and i thought that is not going to be me
6743153 i can tell you ive struggled with that transition quite a bit in the last couple of years
6743154 swimming has been such a huge part of my life i was pretty good at that i guess theres always the fear am i ever going to be that good at anything else again
6743155 i stayed in the sport longer than a lot of people so now at 35 to still be struggling and trying to figure out what you want to be when you grow up you feel like a bit of a flake
6743156 it makes it easy to learn some of the circus acrobatics because of your background in sports
6743157 most employers are going to look at these athletes and be fascinated with their careers and their whole interview might be about what was it like to be at the olympics so the person might not be given a chance to demonstrate theyre fit for that occupation
6743158 the key for the athlete is to use that employers language whatever field theyre going into
6743159 we believe these athletes come with a set of skills that nobody else has in terms of hard work and commitment
6743160 at the same time theyve had years having someone tell them what to eat when to get up and what their training schedule is some of their skills are very transferable and with others they need help
6743161 i dont know why i dont get more calls i should
6743162 everyone acknowledges retirement is really hard and nobody sort of does anything about it
6743163 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6743164 what were seeing in business in our retail businesses or anything having to do with housing is even a further slowing down in june and july both in terms of credit experience where people first got in trouble with house payments and now credit card payments
6743165 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6743166 that doesnt mean that the equity cant get wiped out and it almost has in a practical sense as institutions they dont have any net worth people who own their insured mortgages or own their debt nothing is going to happen to them the equity and preferred stock is another question
6743167 the air strikes are continuing but they havent been hitting our camps
6743168 there has been no statement from the milf leadership but if this continues it could lead to that the military is using all its might
6743169 i would play all these small places in new york where a lot of young musicians get their start
6743170 i would do whatever i could do to get people talking about my music a couple of years into it we could get like 300 or 400 people to show up at new york music venue s o b s but at first we were happy to get like 50 or 60 or 70 people to show up
6743171 but that whole grind is just part of how you get discovered how you develop yourself as a performer
6743172 i think it makes everything i do now more worth it because i put in all that time and all that effort
6743173 john legend is a nickname that some friends started calling me and it kind of grew into my stage name
6743174 legend is something that i never would have chosen for myself originally it grew to the point where more people in my circle would know me by that name than by my real name i had to make a decision
6743175 my bet was on me trying to live up to the name
6743176 kanye was still grinding it out when i was grinding it out
6743177 we did a show at s o b s and the crowd was definitely getting restless while he was performing
6743178 its hard to play a live show when people have no idea who you are i knew he was going to be great and was going to be a big star but at the time no one knew little did they know who he was going to be
6743179 you will not make it in this business and succeed over a long period of time unless you work really hard
6743180 i had to learn as i went when i was grinding and it does make you appreciate your success it makes you realize that its really about the work its really about making the best music you can make its really about working hard
6743181 at the end of the day theres only a few major stars in the music business and then theres all these people that are aspiring to be that
6743182 the peace process must be anchored on justice hence the milf must turn in commander ombra kato bravo and pangalian to face the bar of justice
6743183 we have never deviated from the objectives of the peace process the campaign we are waging is intended to remove the obstacles to peace
6743184 there is no all out war we are doing this to have all out peace in mindanao
6743185 they have created trouble before and during the proceedings of the peace process and they are the ones we would expect to create problems even after a final agreement will be forged between the government and the milf
6743186 if they are truly committed to the peace process we expect for them to comply with the request to surrender the commander non compliance is tantamount to tacit approval of criminal actions of these lawless elements
6743187 its going to get worse before it gets better for them if they think they can delay they are wasting time
6743188 the armed forces of the philippines is using proportionate force precautionary not to affect civilians we are committed to use only force necessary proportionate to the situation
6743189 hes a liar we all know everybody there knows hes been talking about this for so long i dont know why hes claiming not to know anything about it
6743190 escrevi para charlie whiting diretor t cnico da fia e pedi que ele analisasse o trecho a pista ligeiramente saliente e se um pneu acertar a sali ncia poder haver um furo
6743191 i didnt know that could happen at the olympics i didnt fight well but i deserved to win
6743192 its the second time that a filipino judge has penalized us in the tournament
6743193 the rockstar energy mayhem tour was hands down the greatest tour weve ever done and were proud to have been a part of its first year in existence with that said its time to move forward and hit the road once again this october although we originally had the dillinger escape plan onboard for this fall tour theyve recently dropped off and will not be a part of the package just to clarify any rumors floating around their cancellation had nothing to do with tour politics band drama or musical tastes it simply couldnt work out for them this time around and we hope to team up with those guys in the near future as far as the final cleansing the nation lineup is concerned were very happy with how it turned out and well see you all on the road soon
6743194 in a victory for the estate of the late jim morrison the california supreme court has slammed the doors shut
6743195 denied a petition by two of the surviving members of the doors keyboardist ray manzarek and guitarist robby krieger to review a lower courts decision that blocked them from touring under the name of the band that rose to fame on the sunset strip in the 1960s and recorded dark hits such as light my fire l a woman and riders on the storm
6743196 on the hook for more than 5 million after they were found by lower courts to have improperly invoked the doors name and images during a 2003 concert tour
6743197 after the high court declined to hear their appeal on aug 13 theyll have to pay up to drummer john densmore the parents of the deceased lead singer jim morrison and the parents of morrisons deceased wife pamela courson who died in 1974
6743198 densmore said he didnt object to manzarek and krieger touring and singing the doors songs as long as they didnt call themselves the doors use the groups distinctive logo or any other morrison era imagery
6743199 after the two began touring the country with ian astbury former lead singer of the cult and calling themselves the doors of the 21st century
6743200 since morrisons death in paris in 1971 the remaining band members and the parents split morrisons share of the still flourishing sale of the doors music and memorabilia each partner has veto power over business deals
6743201 seven years ago for instance general motors offered the partnership 15 million to use
6743202 me lo tomar con tranquilidad pero tambi n estoy animada para empezar a trabajar en el quinto lbum necesitar tomarme tiempo para ser madre pero pronto regresar a los escenarios
6743203 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6743204 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6743205 overall the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly but among republicans it is up 11 points and among white evangelical republicans it is up 19 points
6743206 there is a slight uptick from 40 percent to 46 percent among people who are uncomfortable to have politicians talking about religion but it is up 10 points among republicans
6743207 it appears to be frustration with the contemporary political landscape more than an underlying philosophical shift
6743208 it is not the case the conservatives are uncomfortable with a political role for religion but we do see increasing discomfort with churches getting involved with politics
6743209 voting intentions among white evangelicals have not changed at all
6743210 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
6743211 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
6743212 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
6743213 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6743214 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6743215 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6743216 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6743217 the uk has some of the toughest laws in the world for sex offenders

6743238 amd plans to dish up a server platform based on a new chipset in the first half of 2009 meanwhile its 45 nanometre shanghai processor will be released in the fourth quarter of this year the chip maker made the announcements on friday just before the intel developer forum kicked off in san francisco the new chipset is aimed at servers with multiple sockets to plug in additional server chips amd claimed the platform would improve performance through new virtualisation resources and support for hypertransport 3 0 bus technology
6743239 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6743240 deadly force can and should be used against any armed adult male if the shot could be taken without a child being injured
6743241 there is absolutely no room for skirmishes of any form
6743242 the pull back is being carried out punctually and we do not intend to change it in the direction of extending the timetable
6743243 peacekeepers at special checkpoints in the quantities needed to ensure security will remain
6743244 we have to understand the essence of what this means to have checkpoints in and around georgian territory by russian forces
6743245 it means there will be an effort by the russian federation to continue to make sure that the georgian economy is never rehabilitated
6743246 there are some checkpoints where one day they are federal troops and the next day peacekeepers
6743247 fifty percent of conservatives think churches and other places of worship should stay out of social and political matters up from 30 percent four years ago according to a survey released thursday by the pew forum on religion and public life and the pew research center for the people and the press that significant shift in conservative thought has brought the country to a tipping point on the question a slim majority of americans 52 percent now think churches should keep out of politics
6743248 so insensitive to the will of a vast majority of our citizens who say traffic is their number one concern detracting from barnstable to approve such a plan
6743249 verschijnen maar omwille van verschillende redenen kwam het toen niet zo ver ondertussen doen steeds meer geruchten de ronde dat de princes of pop zal optreden tijdens de
6743250 theyve got an enduring support structure across the border in pakistan and afghan capabilities are not necessarily getting commensurably better to contend with them and the international community has not marshalled adequate resources either to really give the taliban a good whipping
6743251 the strength of their propaganda is that they are not just vacant threats
6743252 when they send a letter to the canadian people saying more of this is going to come that is actually a credible threat that sort of threat would not have been credible in 2002 we would have laughed at it
6743253 i dont know that the taliban are getting any stronger
6743254 what id say is they are much more aggressive this fighting season than they have been in the past the difference is they are not holding any of the ground that they attack us on
6743255 it certainly wont work on the soldiers that are here in theatre and i like to think it wont work on the canadian population at home
6743256 its important to realize this is not just a story for the last week or two
6743257 this is part of a longer term trend although the disquieting news of the last few days has been particularly jarring in fact the number of attacks the number of casualties and the sophistication of those attacks has been steadily growing for the last two years
6743258 in the past we havent seen anything quite like this
6743259 they think they are making a psychological impact now and they have developed a momentum they have made a calculated decision they can have the maximum impact now by picking up the pace of the attacks
6743260 all this week anton has been training trying to get himself fit

6743262 dass francois in spanien und korsika f r das werks team f hrt erm glicht dass jari matti f r stobart punkte holen kann ein team das er sehr gut kennt und mit dem er viele erfolge geholt hat
6743263 er hat in der vergangenheit bei stobart hervorragende leistungen gezeigt und ich bin sicher dass er dem team in der meisterschaft helfen wird
6743264 its way too early to talk about this being a viable product category
6743265 im not sure how much of a market there is for them particularly with subnotebooks like macbook air with larger keyboards and displays getting thinner and lighter and you can get some real work done on say an iphone or a nokia e series smart phone
6743266 the eee pc has successfully explored user segments that have been ignored by other notebook vendors
6743267 for example a lot of kids use their parents notebooks but they are just too heavy to carry to school but at two pounds kids can easily put ultraportables in their backpacks
6743268 netbooks are for communicating with e mail and im browsing and things like media streaming very basic things
6743269 but theyre not just about the internet we use the term mini notebook
6743270 they were able to borrow without any of the normal restraints they had a blank check from the federal government
6743271 i see it that way too everyone says its so different from bullet boy but i think the differences are superficial obviously its set in a different era about a different class of person and to a large part its shot a different way but the fundamentals of the story are very similar
6743272 you do get lots more interest in a film because its keira knightley starring but you also get lots more interest because everyones investment in the film is that much greater financially
6743273 the push for it to be successful is not limited to the company that invested in the film but with those distributors who have bought territory rights for the film especially the states all of a sudden youre expected to make an international rather than just a british hit
6743274 for the three principal roles the duchess the duke of devonshire and lady spencer i wanted people who could bring baggage with them and for them to be iconic in their own way the duke and lady needed to be aristocrats of the acting world and ralph fiennes and charlotte ramping fitted the bill then keira shares similarities with georgiana both being female superstars of their day finally with lady bess foster and earl grey i chose hayley atwell and dominic cooper as i felt that they should be actors on the rise whom audiences arent terribly familiar with yet
6743275 i fought pretty hard to get him i fought hard to meet him and once id met him i fought hard to make the schedule work around him because he was shooting the reader at the same time he brought loads to the party lots of questions he wouldnt accept playing the duke as just a two dimensional evil aristocratic figure he wanted the duke to be more complex and ambiguous
6743276 i think keira has had favourable responses in the states in previews and the film will hopefully be given a big push at its premiere during the toronto film festival next month i think keira will definitely do a lot of stuff in the states
6743277 bullet boy was in the black film section and i think that the organisers were slightly disappointed when i turned up everyone when they hear my name on the phone they think my name is sol rather than saul
6743278 i dont make a conscious attempt to try to do one thing and not another i try to do films on their own merits and i was certainly not expecting anyone to come to me with a film set 200 years ago but i guess what they wanted from me was a consequence of me having made docs and doing things like bullet boy they wanted something that would feel more real not in a social realist sense but in a way in which you can engage with characters on a more immediate level with a lot of period films i tend to feel there is a difference between the characters on the film and my daily life and i wanted to bridge that gap
6743279 after bullet boy i got a lot of disenfranchised youth scripts through the door and people were thinking that i was either not able to do or not interested in doing other things because i have kids i have to think about my family and im not able to just decide that im going to make a film in america unfortunately i think my next move will all depend on how this goes down
6743280 here i am here i am no right here pay attention to meeeee
6743281 i really am chuffed to bits sunderland are a big club and at this stage in my career it is a dream move for me
6743282 im hungry to do well here i hope to bring goals and energy to the side
6743283 when a club the size of sunderland comes in for you it is an easy decision
6743284 i have met niall quinn and roy keane two legends of the game and it inspires me
6743285 i really appreciated him taking time to show me round all the faciltites which are really impressive
6743286 i cant wait to pull on the jersey im thrilled and excited the ambition of the club is huge it is a club on the up
6743287 ive not played that many games but i played 90 minutes on wednesday so that will help my fitness
6743288 i hope to be involved on saturday well see how it goes
6743289 im looking forward to the challenge tottenham is a tough challenge and it would be great to go there and get a result get off to a winning start
6743290 having played at the stadium of light a few times i know how passionate the sunderland fans are and im looking forward to playing for them
6743291 david is a good signing for us he has a phenomenal international record and will increase competition for places
6743292 it was nice to get out of the tight pack for the ryder cup and its very exciting to see how the team is shaping up
6743293 im having three weeks off after this so im fresh and ready i hope i had a chat with mickelson in akron a few weeks ago and they are up for the challenge
6743294 of course it would be nice to win those things come when they come in bunches i hope
6743295 i got a flier with my second shot and then moved it only a few feet from the hay
6743296 but to birdie the next was important and settled me down
6743297 the six was a wake up call better than coffee i managed to scrape it around but while yesterday was simple today it was a little bit awkward and not pretty really
6743298 at the end of the day it was okay though as long as my name is on the leaderboard im satisfied no matter where the others are
6743299 i dont look at animals i dont learn anything i come to eat
6743300 you have to go to the dairy building and get a malt if youre not doing that youre not living the fair to the fullest

6743314 we trust the court can find a way to protect the companies trade secrets without blocking all information on the allegations in this case
6743315 wed also hope that in reviewing our motion the court decides that providing trade secret protection to evidence related to illegal business practices and behavior would be adverse to the public interest
6743316 that was a big disappointment we had a lot of games towards the end of the season that probably took its toll

6743329 quite honestly i dont know what goes on other sets part of it comes from the fact that we come from and are still involved in relatively low budget film making a certain amount of organisation is key to be being able to operate in that world it is also possible that it is just a temperamental thing other people may function better in a chaotic environment than we do

6743341 but now im here and seen the atmosphere and what it means to everybody else its amazing it feels brilliant im over the moon

6743418 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
6743419 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
6743420 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
6743421 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have found that thats not the case since current treatment acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results
6743422 while the androgen receptor is really driving prostate cancer in another sense it appears that the receptor also normally inhibits the spread of cancer cells it seems to have a dual role manipulating the androgen receptor can increase or decrease either of these actions depending on precisely how its done
6743423 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
6743424 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
6743425 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself
6743426 the more energy dense a food is the more a person with ear infections likes it you can see what that would do to weight gain
6743427 this finding gives a new environmental component to the obesity problem that allows a possibility of intervention
6743428 we need to study larger numbers of people and do taste testing on them to find out more about this possible connection
6743429 this achievement is the result of several years of combined efforts between community health plan and our community health center providers to ensure the best possible care to children throughout the state
6743430 what was novel about our approach to treating children was the partnership we have with our community health center delivery system and our ability to put the needs of the patient first
6743431 as a health insurer and advocate for washingtons individuals and families who deserve the best possible health care community health plan has a business model that leverages compassionate performance based care with a laser focus on financial efficiency the plan enables public dollars to be directed to those it is intended to benefit washingtons families
6743432 our ranking of number one in kids immunizations exemplifies the elevated quality of care provided by a community health center focused delivery system
6743433 in medical research you see something like this once in a lifetime
6743434 this is a very promising approach to cancer treatment and results reported so far are beyond anyones expectations i am very excited to be a part of this confirmatory effort and to be able to offer this unique treatment option to my patients
6743435 traditional chemotherapy for stage iv nsclc still yields disappointing results and my hope is that this trial will improve the natural history of the disease
6743436 the statistics for global lung cancer deaths are staggering i am confident that this phase iii trial will establish lucanix r as a viable treatment option for patients with this dreaded disease
6743437 we saw virtually no side effects in the patients treated in phase ii trials based on our previous trial results we think lucanix r may lead to a significant advancement in patient care we look forward to continuing to enroll patients in this very important clinical study
6743438 we are delighted to have been selected as one of the major centers to test this highly promising immunotherapeutic approach to treating individuals with nsclc
6743439 novarx remains committed to developing whole cellbased therapeutic vaccines for any form of cancer in which this approach may significantly improve patient outcomes by either curing their disease entirely or by stabilizing it over the course of their lives
6743440 this report from wisdom is reassuring that there are real benefits for some women electing to use hrt while it has been well established that quality of life measures are improved in younger symptomatic women this paper adds some information that even older women may benefit while some of this information was reported from the whi which used the same hormonal regimen more sensitive instruments were used in wisdom which was able to show improvements in other measures such as sexual function while this is important information and is reassuring regarding the benefits of hrt these findings in isolation are not an indication to initiate hormones in asymptomatic older women for the first time
6743441 this is a significant study which supports our views on hrt it shows that hrt can offer real benefits to most women experiencing menopausal symptoms our advice remains the same each woman is an individual and she needs to discuss whats right for her with her doctor in the light of her medical history this study reinforces the benefits of appropriate use
6743442 the longer a serious disease goes undiagnosed the harder it is to treat and the further it can spread
6743443 this new test will eliminate a lot of the guesswork
6743444 being able to get such quick results for so many pathogens at once will become critical in case of bioterrorism
6743445 under that scenario every minute counts in providing treatment or preventing disease spread
6743446 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
6743447 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away
6743448 we are pleased to see the data from this study support earlier published data on the use of the immuknow assay in monitoring adult patients after a renal transplant
6743449 clearly there is further research needed to elucidate the appropriate standards for use of cell mediated immunity to monitor risk for infection and rejection in selected patient categories however this publication further illustrates the potential risks for infection associated with over immunosuppression in renal transplant patients and the potential value of the immuknow assay in monitoring immune status
6743450 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group sexuality was also improved
6743451 overall quality of life measures improved even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a small but measurable improvement in quality of life and a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains hrt users also had more breast tenderness and discharge compared to those on a placebo
6743452 these new data should be added to the risk benefit equation for hrt the quality of life benefits of hrt may be greater in women with more severe symptoms near menopause new research suggests that hrt taken from near menopause avoids the cardiovascular risks seen when hrt is initiated many years after menopause
6743453 enable the risks of hrt to be reduced and its benefits maximized when the treatment is individualized to each woman
6743454 early start up side effects can usually be alleviated by adjusting the treatment
6743455 for most women with significant menopause symptoms the benefits of hrt outweigh the risks
6743456 if a woman feels that hrt is needed for quality of life then doctors can find the safest regimen for her she can try going off hrt every 4 5 years and can then make an informed choice about whether she takes and continues hrt
6743457 to really improve adolescent health programs should seek to reduce risk taking improve social capital and improve levels of affluence
6743458 overall assessments of health may be an important measure for different reasons than more specific and detailed measurements it is a holistic approach as opposed to a specific approach
6743459 our analysis actually states that social capital affluence and risk taking all influence health but these things do not work together
6743460 the agency lacks the budget the statutory authority and the scientific expertise to ensure the hundreds of nanoproducts now on the market among them baby bottle nipples infant teething rings paints waxes kitchenware and appliances are safe this problem will only worsen as more sophisticated nanotechnology based products begin to enter the consumer market
6743461 during the fall of 2007 many americans faced a hazard in their products that had been banned for 30 years lead as millions of childrens toys coated with lead paint were recalled it became clear that government oversight had failed and that the cpsc the agency primarily responsible for the oversight of these toys was stretched too thin from years of neglect underfunding and the challenges posed by an increasingly global manufacturing system
6743462 it is against this background that we need to ask the question is the cpsc adequately prepared to deal with nanotechnology which is now associated with more than 800 manufacturer identified consumer products ranging from infant pacifiers to paints to appliances to clothing
6743463 it took decades of research before lawmakers found the political will to keep lead and phthalates out of toys it could take a very long time to research and ensure that potentially dangerous nanomaterials are kept out too
6743464 anticancer research is aimed at understanding the molecular pathways hat can be selectively targeted to halt tumor growth
6743465 we know that the mtor pathway is activated in many cancers and therefore is a good target for fighting a wide array of tumors
6743466 we analyzed tissue from human biopsies as well as cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer
6743467 this study inserts a new piece of information into the puzzle of the effects of mtorc1 inhibitors in cell signaling
6743468 furthermore because there are inhibitors of mapk pathway already approved for the treatment of cancer it provides us with the rationale for using combinations of mtorc1 and mapk inhibitors in attacking tumors thereby offering cancer patients another treatment option with immediate applicability

6743478 cut up all over the place jumpin on the piano movin every which way
6743479 he wrecked the house tearing off strings and doing my moves elvis was the first colour blind person i knew
6743480 negro artists in the south who wanted to make a record and just had no place to go
6743481 white man who had the negro sound and the negro feel
6743482 he knew at least part of every song i could think of marty robbins to billy eckstine you name it and several i didnt know at all
6743483 elvis impressed me because with a few basic chords he could play rhythm guitar with anybody and he had that same kind of rhythm in his voice
6743484 i told him elvis could keep time stay on key and meter
6743485 bill and i had never heard it before but we joined in jamming sam stopped us and said what are you doing we said we dont know he said run through it again and find out
6743486 we only did three or four takes and sam didnt do anything to produce it except once in a while say elvis move in a little closer to the mike or back up a bit
6743487 after all there were only three mikes in the room just one for elviss vocal and guitar in those old studios the sound was always changing because the air conditioning wasnt working and the temperature rose or youre in a different part of the room but thank god when elvis started to play sams ear got it even though he didnt know what he was looking for none of us did but i realised it had to be natural not contrived that was the brass ring with elvis
6743488 in scotty moores tight precise but driving guitar lines in bill blacks galloping but perfectly timed bass and most of all in elviss vocals a witches brew of gospel swoops falsetto shrieks growls howls and scat in crudups original the predominant feeling is maudlin and dejected elviss up tempo version is instead an anthem to human cockiness to the healing transcendent powers of the life force
6743489 he tried not to show it but he felt so inferior he reminded me of a black man in that way
6743490 and now we got somethin new gonna cut loose good people this is elvis presley
6743491 it happened in identically the same way only this time it was bill started it
6743492 i was having a coke he was in the studio leaning on his bass and for no reason at all he started slapping on it and singing blue moon of kentucky only uptempo not the very reverent waltz time that bill monroe wrote it in elvis sang it with him we all looked at each other again
6743493 two or three people called elvis right away wanting to be his booking agent or his manager he told us i dont know what to say so sam suggested do a years contract with scotty that will give us time we can all work with
6743494 a singer of reputation and renown and possesses bright promise of large success
6743495 here we come with two funky little instruments and elvis instead of just standing flat footed and tapping his foot well he was kind of jiggling plus i think with those old loose britches that we wore you shook your leg and it made it look like all hell was going on under there during the instrumental parts he would back off from the mike and be playing and shaking and the crowd would just go wild
6743496 still i never saw him doing anything intentionally vulgar in those days later on he got a little more risqu whatever the traffic would bear but everything he did in the early days was natural
6743497 its like a surge of electricity going through you its almost like making love but its even stronger than that
6743498 popular music has reached its lowest depths in the grunt and groin antics of one elvis presley
6743499 and he damn sure was intuitive and he damn sure had an appreciation for the total spirituality of human existence even if he would never have thought of the term
6743500 the coloured folks been singing it just like im doin now man for more years than i know
6743501 nobody paid it no mind till i goosed it up i got it from them down in tupelo mississippi i used to hear old arthur crudup bang his box the way i do now and i said if i ever got to the place where i could feel all old arthur felt id be a music man like nobody ever saw

6743504 i do this every day i do this well every day
6743505 i hate watching people apologize after a bad performance but i now know why they do it
6743506 there was a lot of pressure on me and that pressure amounted to expectations of people back home

6743508 obviously the interest of a documentary film corresponds closely to the interest inherent in the subject matter this popularity served to make fiction film producers more keenly aware of the effectiveness and authority of reality an awareness which gave rise to the neo realist style of film and contributed to the still growing trend toward location filming
6743509 the intimacy imposed upon us by the physical reality of other art works present us with alternative choices either to identify with or to deny the experience they propose or to withdraw altogether to a detached awareness of that reality as merely a metaphor but the film image whose intangible reality consists of lights and shadows beamed through the air and caught on the surface of a silver screen comes to us as a reflection of another world at that distance we can accept the reality of the most monumental and extreme of images and from that perspective we can perceive and comprehend them in their full dimension the invented event which is then introduced though itself an artifice borrows reality from the reality of the scene from the natural blowing of the hair the irregularity of the waves the very texture of the stones and sand in short from all the uncontrolled spontaneous elements which are the property of actuality itself only in photography by the delicate manipulation which i called controlled accident can natural phenomena be incorporated into our own creativity to yield an image where the reality of a tree confers its truth upon the events we cause to transpire beneath it
6743510 a perceptually realistic image is one which structurally corresponds to the viewers audiovisual experience of three dimensional space perceptually realistic images correspond to this experience because film makers build them to do so such images display a nested hierarchy of cues which organize the display of light color texture movement and sound in ways that correspond with the viewers own understanding of these phenomenon in daily life because of this unreal images may be referentially fictional but perceptually real
6743511 is that to specify meaning one at times has to step outside the language system and poststructural methodologies have been most unwilling to posit the possibility of doing this in many accounts one cannot get outside representation at all because it is by definition determinative of human thought and experience p 91

6743520 hizbullah is ready and prepared to take initiative and avenge the assassination of senior organization member imad mugniyah
6743521 when the opportunity on the ground allows it while examining the ramifications of such an operation
6743522 the timing must be right for the forces and the countries which are hizbullahs allies and out of the assumption that any response by israel may affect everyone this compels hizbullah and its allies to be on the alert for an open war
6743523 there is no escape from revenge this is a fact which will arrive sooner or later as for hizbullah it cannot evade this or be hesitant in terms of responding to the assassination
6743524 in addition keeping quiet will open the enemys appetite to continue assassinating other senior officials israels threats to destroy lebanon and its infrastructure will not change hizbullahs determination
6743525 the organization has studied the insights and lessons on the new israeli mentality
6743526 the next war will be destructive for both sides with the enemys home front being hit with intensive missile barrages and the air force operating against a significant threat as will the enemys navy and ground forces
6743527 any israeli decision to launch a war will be like suicide
6743528 in regards to the home front hizbullah has developed its missile lineup in terms of effectiveness destruction skills and the ability to accurately hit targets and today it can launch hundreds of missiles in one wave to several targets inside israel without the enemy possessing the ability to deter or restrict it
6743529 limit the burden of the air forces activity in lebanons skies
6743530 has spent more than 800 million on the establishment of military infrastructure in southern lebanon and the lebanon valley in preparation for the expected open war these preparations were carried out in a continuous manner in accordance with the expected threats

6743540 is dietary knowledge enough hunger stress and other roadblocks to healthy eating
6743541 when individuals extend the interval between meals or consume more of their food away from home they are significantly more likely to consume more calories and more calories from solid fats alcohol and added sugars discretionary calories at each eating occasion
6743542 for example going five hours between meals instead of four adds about 52 calories for someone on a diet of 2 000 calories per day extending that interval from four to six hours would add about 91 calories to the meal going longer stretches between meals is also estimated to lower diet quality at each meal
6743543 making specific reference to such situations and suggesting ways to mitigate their effects should enhance the usefulness of educational campaigns designed to improve diet quality
6743544 limiting intake of foods prepared away from home is also estimated to significantly decrease caloric consumption thus another possibility would be to encourage individuals to plan ahead or seek out information about nutrient and caloric content of foods prepared away from home
6743545 yes we refrain from the exercises but it is only a response

6743548 the trend in naming pets is going toward more human names
6743549 they can really pick up on them it gets too complicated with more than that but give a name with a punch to it
6743550 any pet as soon as they can id their name that is the first step in training
6743551 she is a husky i wanted something to do with nature but as she was a member of my family too i just wanted her to have a name that a person could have too
6743552 ella is a name i have always liked and in my job as a name expert compiling data and giving advice about baby names to people all the time it is one that i had seen that i really liked
6743553 it is a very popular name though and one that i wouldnt use for a child of my own only because i see so many little ellas and bellas being named every day
6743554 dogs before were used for work on the farm and different occupations people would keep them outside in a dog house
6743555 nowadays they are in the house even sleeping in the bed sometimes

6743562 the heating problem was treated and corrected by spanair maintenance personnel
6743563 the fault was isolated and the aircraft was dispatched for flight
6743564 we have reviewed the details on this faulty situation with the inspectors of our civil aviation authority and we all come to the conclusion that there was nothing abnormal in this resolution of that problem

6743573 what can i say the bucktards bring out the best worst in me
6743574 it was related to not having provided enough diapers to properly care for the residents needs
6743575 this particular incident shows that we are determined to take action on these things as they arise
6743576 we have discovered that staff have been deliberately hoarding incontinent products in the residents closets dressers and in their clothing i e sleeves of coats jackets and sweaters
6743577 the front line staff has then been complaining that there are not enough of these products on hand for them to deliver incontinent care to our residents this is not acceptable and is an untrue statement
6743578 hoarding of supplies is theft and will not be tolerated
6743579 staff because they are busy or whatever will take product and hoard it in individual residents rooms and hide it why do they hide it because it is easier to hide it in a closet than it is to go to the trolley

6743587 the glory of sport comes from dedication determination and desire achieving success and personal glory in athletics has less to do with wins and losses than it does with learning how to prepare yourself so that at the end of the day whether on the track or in the office you know that there was nothing more you could have done to reach your ultimate goal

6743609 the agreement is further proof that major organisations appreciate the value of our products particularly in the area of child health

6743621 the industry will have to look seriously at how it can maintain its productivity if numbers fall significantly
6743622 the issue is that food and drink companies turn to migrant labour because they cannot find staff in the numbers they need at home
6743623 ministers need to be fully aware of the contribution migrant workers make to the food and drink industry when it comes to developing policies on immigration
6743624 the fdf believes that collaboration between the council and industry leaders is required to improve the image of the food and drink industry as an attractive place for unskilled and semi skilled british people to work in
6743625 this will come as a shock to industry and a blow to companies that have had their applications rejected the potential economic damage is vast
6743626 these opinions make it clear it is not going to be easy for companies to have claims approved
6743627 from a scientific perspective they have done a good job but it will make many companies stop and think about whether they want to risk going into the procedure or not
6743628 this indicates efsa is applying very high standards on the reduction of disease claims

6743630 if every substance has to be characterised then that presents a major problem for generic claims because for most of them the substance by its very generic nature is not characterised
6743631 if the same criteria applied here for dairy products are applied to fruits and vegetables then no fruits and vegetables will be able to make health claims which is preposterous
6743632 the verdict on the ala la claim is strange in that the benefit is accepted so we feel that a scientifically substantiated statement should be accepted

6743693 when will a decision be made on the successful candidate
6743694 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
6743695 the process more than the end result is what inspires my work

6743703 there is only one real failure in life that is possible and that is not to be true to the best one knows
6743704 when we have done our best we should wait the result in peace
6743705 it is a funny thing about life if you refuse to accept anything but the best you very often get it
6743706 i have simply tired to do what seemed best each day as each day came

6743728 il decreto sulla sicurezza ha ricordato sturani d ai sindaci nuovi poteri e permette loro di emettere delle ordinanze questo non esclude che nel rispetto della libert e autonomia dei singoli comuni le decisioni possano essere coordinate e per questo che all inizio di agosto lanci ha deciso di aprire un sito nel quale pubblicare tutte le ordinanze emesse inviate alle prefetture e quindi al ministero dellinterno sar una sorta di osservatorio per il monitoraggio della situazione in questa prima fase comunque da mettere nel conto questa situazione un po di fantasia non stupisce e non guasta
6743729 ci sar un tavolo con il ministero dellinterno per stabilire come i comuni debbano utilizzare quelle risorse
6743730 chi occupa le panchine dice zanonato sono gli immigrati che non sanno dove andare dunque se come comprensibile li si sposta per permettere agli anziani di sedersi bisogna per anche porsi il problema di dove sistemare quelle persone che non hanno un luogo dove stare
6743731 se fossero provvedimenti omogenei tanto vale fare una legge che vale su tutto il territorio i comuni devono salvaguardare il decoro e la sicurezza delle citt devono fare rispettare le regole ma vanno anche trovare delle alternative per evitare di accentuare le situazioni di emarginazione

6743743 apple sold these devices on the promise that they were twice as fast as the pre existing phones and that they would function suitably or properly on the 3g network but thus far apple and the phone have failed to deliver on this promise
6743744 se gostasses do martin parr n o te custava tanto
6743745 dat komt vooral door de stijgende brandstofprijzen en het steeds groter wordende bewustzijn bij de mensen
6743746 de voorbije jaren was er al een sterke verkoop dat in combinatie met de stijgende brandstofprijzen en de dalende koopkracht had ons doen verwachten dat het aantal personenwagens zou dalen toch verwachten we nog een terugval in de tweede helft van het jaar ten opzichte van het jaar voordien
6743747 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6743748 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6743749 the russian georgia conflict has disrupted supplies and it looks like it will drag on and create a lot of uncertainty
6743750 the good companies will come out of the storm stronger than they were ever before
6743751 there may be a good thing with this storm maybe we will finally get our act together and make decisions that need to be made and start making some real money one day
6743752 we all need to look for areas that have some growth and create some competitive advantage through your investment
6743753 i think 10 years from now the biofuel industry will be equally big as the paper industry today
6743754 id invest in strong brands where i believe the customer and consumer sentiment is likely to last over declines like louis vuitton
6743755 i think its ridiculous youd have to pay to check your own credit report
6743756 you dont even have to sign up for monitoring service and you dont have to do any kind of
6743757 that way if theres a mistake you can get it fixed
6743758 theres a glaring gap in the wrap report it doesnt mention how much food is wasted before it comes into our homes the supermarkets waste food far more lavishly and for much worse reasons than we poor house spouses they over order fresh produce because they can pass the costs of disposal back to the supplier they reject up to 60 per cent of perfectly good vegetables because they do not fit exact shape and quality standards they bully us with daft use by dates and worst of all in meat processing as much as a third of the edible tissue of animals is discarded because it doesnt meet the supermarkets narrow definitions of the sellable
6743759 fareshare helped save 2 000 tonnes of edible food from landfill providing meals for 3 3m people this in turn meant 13 000 tonnes less carbon dioxide was emitted into the environment
6743760 we fund a major hotels sectoral project called green hospitality award which provides them with expertise know how and assessments of their resource use and waste generation including waste from kitchens and catering over 150 of the biggest hotels in ireland have signed up already we would hope to expand this project into the general restaurant and contract catering areas with a view to reducing the generation of food waste and its disposal in these sectors

6743763 it couldnt be a better time for the maine blueberry industry some speculators thought it wouldnt last another 10 years but i think we proved them wrong the state of the industry is very healthy
6743764 most growers take a lot of pride in what they do in their fields they are like big gardens to all of us
6743765 what can we do about it dont give me problems give me solutions
6743766 people have to be informed educated and understand a problem exists first before something is done
6743767 is anyone doing anything is just one of you doing something as the other does nothing
6743768 if i were them id quite right now then where would she be shes doing nothing but bitching where would she be if they just left id applaud them if they quite right now
6743769 against the insidious wiles of foreign influence a free people ought to be constantly awake
6743770 how are you typing i thought your father glued your fingers to his asshole and your face to his cock to shit in your hands and piss in your eyes years ago
6743771 whether we will be a wanted or an unwanted resident or a good corporate citizen
6743772 the move will be at great cost to tata motors and to shareholders but there is a concern about our people a definite concern about not being wanted

6743775 its funny how many times i meet people and i start to talk actually having an in depth conversation about politics or religion and it takes them off guard
6743776 i used to take it as an offense but its just the idea thats out there people dont expect us to have brain cells i guess
6743777 i had no clue about proper etiquette or dress when youre going into casting calls and go sees so little ronnie at 15 got in his prom tuxedo and went into an open call the agent was about ready to have a coronary laughing so hard at me

6743782 even though i am far away and lying on a hospital bed i am steeling myself to
6743783 show your protest loudly and clearly all the way to the ballot box on tuesday
6743784 umno bn sees this by election as crucial because a loss would take pakatan rakyat forward to putrajaya they are afraid that come sept 16 something will happen

6743786 n o quero te dar s a minha boca quero me dar por inteira
6743787 it goes right back to when the convicts were shipped over and this feeling that weve always been seen as convicts which is why theres this desire even now to show that weve moved on as a country and that were better than britain
6743788 what i can do is do a courtesy exchange but it wont happen again cause there is not an issue with 3g
6743789 using the iphone on a network it is not designed for may break the iphone
6743790 oh no sir we inform all our customers before we sell them the 3g iphone
6743791 well no one informed me i wouldnt have bought one had i known but i guess thats the plan wouldnt sell as many phones if people knew the truth lying by omission is still lying
6743792 as much as the chip may be the chief problem glitches may also stem from apples software or the at amp t network part of the role of the infineon chip is to check whether theres enough 3g bandwidth available in a given area if 3g isnt available or there isnt enough bandwidth the iphone will be shifted to a slower network one source says apple programmed the infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3g signal than the iphone really requires so if too many people try to make a call or go on the internet in a given area some of the devices will decide theres insufficient power and switch to the slower network even if there is enough 3g bandwidth available according to this person the problems are only occurring in areas of high iphone density these include the san francisco bay area boston and certain overseas locales the reason the problem has gotten worse in recent days is because of the steep increase in iphone activations in these places the more people who are trying to use a given piece of gear the more likely they are to get bumped
6743793 im having the same problem and i live in the pocket area of sacramento i called att and they told me it was not the phone but the 3g network it would be interesting to have other 3g phones in the same exact area and see if they are also having the same problem if the other phones are having the problem then its the network 3g if not then it has to be the 3g i phone so lets see how long it will take this issue to be resolved so we may enjoy our i phones
6743794 i can happily report that ever since we have done the sim swap routine we now have three working iphone 3gs
6743795 any idea why my service wouldnt have 5 bars one mile from a tower
6743796 here is the bug here is the fix update the driver
6743797 what i was told was that 90 of the disconnects are initiated inside the phone which would exonerate at amp t
6743798 here is the bug here is the fix update the driver
6743799 apple released a patch we dont know if it works or not
6743800 heres an example iphone 1 no service iphone 2 106 dbm iphone 3 103 dbm iphone 4 no service iphone 5 106 dbm swisscom field test equipment nokia 3g transceiver 72 dbm swisscom field test equipment samsung 3g receiver 74 dbm swisscom field test equipment s e 3g receiver 76 dbm swisscom usb 3g stick hp notebook 71 dbm swisscom pc card dell notebook 79 dbm
6743801 the problem is affecting 2 to 3 of iphone traffic the people say that compares with a dropped call rate of around 1 for all traffic for at amp t
6743802 further to our telephone conversation on 20th august 2008 i can confirm that a case has been raised with apple with regards to the signal and service issues with their new 3g iphones apple have advised that they are presently working on a fix for this issue and hope to have resolved with the latest software updates
6743803 look we know there is a global problem going on were working on it
6743804 what i didnt hear you iphone iphone are you there
6743805 safari cant open the page because it could not connect to the server
6743806 hey this 3g connection ill search for non 3g reception
6743807 sitting here with an iphone and a nokia n80 side by side both on o2 zero or occassionally 1 bar on 3g network for the iphone 101db compared to the full seven or so bars on the n80
6743808 bars are not an indication of how strong the signal is
6743809 just arent a good indicator of where your signal strength is
6743810 yeah theres a chance that some of the first batch could have some reception issues just like any product
6743811 o2 says it tested the phone extensively before launch but found no appreciable difference in behaviour to other phones
6743812 as the president of the law review obama didnt write articles he edited and reviewed them
6743813 they probably dont want to have you reporters going back
6743814 i havent seen the new ben stiller movie tropic thunder and i wont go see the movie because of what ive heard but i want to add my two cents to the opinions on whether its offensive to the mentally challenged
6743815 i know ben stiller has said that hes making fun of actors not people with disabilities still the movie is geared toward a younger crowd and i fear a lot of those teenagers and college students will leave the theater thinking r is an okay word to use its not its taken years to get people to stop using that word
6743816 do you really expect a candidate running for president of the u
6743817 things been there 2 years time to take down the plastic petunias

6743819 you cant talk to it it cant talk to you all you can do is stand back and be awed by it
6743820 you know what i do on hot days like this i keep my undies in the ice box
6743821 i can say to you that my words that i give you are yours to feel to keep and to be loved by i hope that this blog helps create the warmth i feel within me
6743822 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
6743823 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
6743824 several hundred individuals known to be involved in or closely associated with violent extremist activity
6743825 challenge many of the stereotypes that are held about who becomes a terrorist and why
6743826 are a diverse collection of individuals fitting no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism
6743827 if the basis of a popular government in peacetime is virtue its basis in a time of revolution is virtue and terror virtue without which terror would be barbaric and terror without which virtue would be impotent

6743830 the national executive is taking this matter very seriously and is awaiting the results of medical tests before determining the full extent of the discipline that will be imposed upon him
6743831 we are very concerned for the many people who have been or will be hurt by michaels actions
6743832 we encourage all of our churches to pray for all those affected
6743833 is he getting worse or is he playing it up in front of a bigger crowd
6743834 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
6743835 then said he unto the disciples it is impossible but that offences will come but woe unto him through whom they come it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive him
6743836 that means under all circumstances even hardships like this one
6743837 if any of us have not sinned cast the first stone
6743838 we chose mazatlan because we had been there on vacation and knew it would be a friendly peaceful place to spend our first year abroad and learn spanish

6744326 the good news is this represents an opportunity for savvy retailers
6744327 theres been a feeling that there isnt much of a market downtown what this says is that there is quite a robust market
6744328 based upon positive perceptions and prevailing usage patterns downtowns current patrons can be expected to respond favorably to new stores restaurants entertainment venues and event programming as downtowns offering grows
6744329 it is imperative that downtown greensboros offerings remain unique and of high quality

6744332 tens of thousands of australian workers are continuing to be hurt by work choices
6744333 in recent weeks there has been clear evidence that telstra rio tinto cochlear and other major companies are still exploiting work choices
6744334 despite reaping windfall profits many of australias biggest companies are holding on to work choices and are refusing to let their workers bargain collectively for better pay and conditions
6744335 this week rio tinto has joined a growing list of companies that is snubbing the rudd governments ir policy by refusing to negotiate with the union that represents workers at the pilbara iron company
6744336 last week one of australias largest employers telstra was exposed as having a secret agenda to reduce pay and conditions for telstra workers by sidelining unions at the company
6744337 bionic ear manufacturer and exporter cochlear also announced it would refuse to negotiate with the union representing its workers despite a recent adverse ruling in the industrial relations commission
6744338 we are seeing major employers ignoring the will of the australian people at the last election to get rid of work choices
6744339 it is now time for the rudd government to deliver its new ir laws and to scrap the rest of work choices

6744495 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6744496 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6744497 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6744498 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6744499 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6744500 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6744501 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6744502 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6744503 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6744504 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6744505 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6744506 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6744507 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6744508 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6744509 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6744510 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6744511 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6744512 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6744513 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6744514 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6744515 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6744516 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6744517 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6744518 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6744519 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6744520 who are open to doing something on the production side
6744521 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6744522 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6744523 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6744524 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6744525 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6744526 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6744527 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6744528 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6744529 i hope we can show the nation that the democratic party can come together and turn our country around organized labor needs to play a principal role in making certain that gets done in denver
6744530 long term care workers work hard and they need a powerful union to serve their interests
6744531 reports of nepotism and lavish spending smack of hypocrisy these actions betray the trust of the workers who place so much hope in the union to better their lives
6744532 a lot of us were excited that the s e i u organized home care workers because it meant it was representing the working poor
6744533 but then tyrone freeman comes along and tarnishes the image of the s e i u
6744534 we and many others in california and beyond have long been expressing concerns to stern about the leadership of the long term care union here
6744535 these allegations are of serious concern to all of us and we support mr freemans decision to put the best interests of the members first we are committed to protecting our members through strong and steady leadership and with a fair free and accountable investigation
6744536 these arent factory workers who can easily gather signatures on the factory floor or in a parking lot during a break
6744537 these workers are isolated they dont have a clue who else is in the union its a totally onerous burden its virtually impossible for a rank and file person to get all these signatures
6744538 it is becoming increasingly clear that seiu leaders often see students and campus workers as little more than pawns to use as they see fit
6744539 seiu has sought to maneuver these pawns in a way that brings new members and dues into the union in the short term but keeps workers in poverty and actually hurts our collective efforts to help unions grow at a massive scale
6744540 the deal ensured unc workers could not join seiu by letting aramark decide which workers could join the union
6744541 the information in the letter from the student organizations to andy stern is simply not true
6744542 we would never even attempt to respond to such a document which seems to be part of an anti stern campaign
6744543 but i want to make the point that its just an extension of what unions have been forced to do
6744544 when summer break came the swu organizers left promising to return the following year
6744545 after weeks of unreturned phone calls students and workers learned that seiu leaders had cut a deal with aramark
6744546 our employees have the right to choose whether or not to join a union in a process that is free from coercion or intimidation
6744547 the students are motivated by this kind of ideological emotional and political vision of unionism and correctly so and i think seiu is in danger of pushing that aside
6744548 they should have insisted we insist on north carolina or berkeley one of the hotspots
6744549 we respect the right of each of our affiliates to act autonomously
6744550 however we as a national organization are committed to remaining neutral in seius internal conflicts and those of all our union allies
6744551 we already had our campaign going on and then this other union comes in that was shady
6744552 this blatant effort by aramark to undermine the workers sic efforts is not surprising but seius complicity is appalling
6744553 i dont want to see the union behave in a way that engenders distrust
6744554 i think it actually could result in long term harm in the labor movement
6744555 i think there probably are clearly times where the union has kind of used students as leverage
6744556 i dont want to say as pawns but certainly as leverage in order to win these agreements or win these campaigns and i think that creates a lot of resentment on the part of students
6744557 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6744558 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6744559 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6744560 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6744561 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6744562 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6744563 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6744564 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6744565 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6744566 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6744567 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6744568 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6744569 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6744570 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6744571 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6744572 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6744573 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6744574 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6744575 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6744576 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6744577 who gives the sun for a light by day the ordinances of the moon and the stars for a light by night who disturbs the sea and its waves roar the lord of hosts is his name
6744578 who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power
6744579 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now
6744580 evil pursueth sinners but to the righteous good shall be repayed
6744581 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6744582 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6744583 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6744584 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6744585 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6744586 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6744587 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6744588 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6744589 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6744590 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6744591 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6744592 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6744593 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6744594 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6744595 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6744596 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6744597 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6744598 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6744599 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6744600 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6744601 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6744602 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6744603 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6744604 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6744605 i once skinned my knee so now this character will skin his knee
6744606 the main challenge now is not what they call the enemy its an intra government crisis that is preventing them from focusing on the tasks they need to get done
6744607 there has been a lack of vigour and if i may say so a lack of commitment
6744608 i did not encounter many hassles on my way back from south africa only that some officials initially asked for an import licence saying the volume of goods i was carrying indicated that i was importing them for commercial purposes but they finally let me go incredibly without me paying anything
6744609 naturally come to the rescue of consumers who now can use their money to buy more
6744610 there could be a marked improvement in established shops as well but buying from these might be the privilege of a few since their prices are prohibitive
6744611 i hope it suspension of import duty will be extended when it expires in december
6744612 the government knows too well that informal traders like myself are providing relief considering the widespread shortages of basic commodities compounded by the scaling down of operations by well established shops and wholesalers we require a lot of support through policies that ensure that our businesses though not formalised are boosted
6744613 we are making the best of the suspension in order to buy big volumes of goods for use in our households we have teamed up to mobilise enough money another member and i will be crossing the border to buy the goods
6744614 while we might be able to stock our houses with basic commodities the problem is that now and then we need to buy clothes for the children and ourselves but the big shops that sell them are charging unaffordable prices
6744615 a possibilidade de um bloqueio grande e eu diria que isso deve ter sido feito por quest es de conte do
6744616 barack obamas failure to accurately report his campaigns financial records is an incredibly suspicious situation that appears to be an attempt to hide his campaigns interaction with a left wing organization previously convicted of voter fraud for a candidate who claims to be practicing new politics his fec reports look an awful lot like the old style chicago politics of yesterday
6744617 the rnc can concoct all of the outlandish conspiracy theories they want but when we saw that our fec report didnt accurately reflect the field work csi was hired to perform we corrected it its pretty bold for the rnc to attack us for a clerical error after john mccains campaign was just forced to return 50 000 raised by a foreign national through a number of contributors who werent even supporting mccain
6744618 its rare that people dont file any amended reports if he has a pattern of lots and lots of amended reports that would be more noteworthy than an occasional one
6744619 all of this just seems like an awful lot of money and time spent on political campaigning for an organization that purports to exist to help low income consumers
6744620 acorn has a long and sordid history of employing convoluted enron style accounting to illegally use taxpayer funds for their own political gain
6744621 now it looks like acorn is using the same type of convoluted accounting scheme for obamas political gain
6744622 that was a very short term contract for one week of work in ohio they asked us to do canvasses in five cities statewide
6744623 assist persons and organizations who advance the interests of low and moderate income people
6744624 i do not know the day to day work of what they do im on the board
6744625 not for profit political and campaign management firm much like any political consulting firm
6744626 we have a wide range of clients we provide political campaign management we provide field services
6744627 our clients are typically considered liberal our clients are labor unions liberal to progressive candidates nonprofit organizations on the liberal side of the political spectrum
6744628 we are organized specifically not to make money but we make money there are no profits we have a staff of 60 people around the country and that eats up our entire profit were not a for profit corporation but we are not a group like a united way
6744629 acorn has a lot of different partner organizations we are a partner but we are separate
6744630 but we have asked the international gymnastics federation to look into a number of questions and discrepancies on the cases we have been working with the chinese national federation to really have a full clarification on this topic
6744631 we did discuss it earlier in the games and we believed we had addressed the issue no doubt the federation itself will communicate further
6744632 a jealous husband wrecked a cricketers flat in the belief he was having an affair with his wife a court heard yesterday
6744633 matthews of penzance admitted criminal damage and was given 160 hours community work by magistrates in taunton deane he was also ordered to pay 5 000 compensation and faces a civil action by edwards 24 who denied any affair with his wife pam 48 she left court with matthews
6744634 not at all this is just a game of cricket
6744635 it is difficult to think of a more tired clich than afghanistan on course for a world cricket league division five final showdown with the usa save perhaps sadly eliminated germany winning the thing by bowl out
6744636 olympic cricket gold is probably the only thing left in the world game that australia havent won and there is always the chance that a gb bowling attack would crumble at the prospect of having to face germany in a semi final bowl out

6744639 there is a major discrepancy in the two urine samples of asif which came out positive and in such cases the player has a chance to be cleared
6744640 this is a lot of difference and im sure if his lawyer pursues the case asif has a chance to come out clean
6744641 as matt prior assured the assembled cricket media that his wicketkeeping was much improved since his previous stint with england a pen top wielded interrogatively by the man from the

6744653 he anwar will win for sure because everybody knows the sodomy case is just a trick by the government and its his home ground
6744654 my guess is the majority will be slightly reduced because of dirty politics but some of my customers seem to be too idealistic and maybe they want some change in government since they are asking to bet on higher majorities
6744655 the cabinet today decided to bring forward the enforcement date for adjustment of the new petrol price

6744658 i was tired boss and i only wanted to have a quick bite and go to bed but this waitress she kept pointing at me and talking about me to the other customers then she asked me in a loud voice if a cup of soup and a cracker would be enough and she laughed i told her no that i was hungry and wished the entire menu to be brought one dish at a time it took me four hours to eat it all
6744659 its just too expensive for me to pay 5 a day for my daughters to eat a school lunch
6744660 and the quality of the food isnt that great either
6744661 like everyone else the district is affected by rising food prices and the fuel to deliver that food
6744662 parents see the price increase every time they go to the grocery store
6744663 its just one more thing that is going up as a result of gas prices
6744664 whether its buying our sons school clothes textbooks pencils or lunch its one more thing that is affecting our wallets you cant blame the farmers you cant blame the school districts its just the reality of the world now
6744665 so this would make the hybrid bus cost about what the yellow bus costs
6744666 its just so easy to quick run in grab a few things and be out the door in 15 minutes
6744667 because of the smaller size of the store its easier for me to walk up and down the aisles
6744668 our son lives in henrietta and is looking forward to seeing what the new store looks like inside
6744669 i cant wait to see the expression on the faces of customers as we welcome them to their new store
6744670 up until now our stores used a wood burning oven that did not offer much flexibility in terms of efficiency
6744671 this new oven the second one weve installed in a store allows us to shut off parts of the oven that are not being used saving energy its also fun because customers can watch the ovens light up when they are in use
6744672 we have replaced less energy efficient forms of lighting with led lighting which produce less heat and high efficiency fluorescent fixtures
6744673 like all new wegmans stores this store uses environmentally friendly glycol in medium temperature refrigerated cases instead of regular refrigerant dramatically reducing carbon dioxide emissions
6744674 the old store has been my home for many years and i am definitely going to miss it but its going to be a lot of fun to start a new one

6744686 people sign cards to just get the union organizer off their back

6744688 during an election campaign there is a considerable amount of pressure on workers
6744689 it comes from unions from employers from co workers the problem with the bill is that it puts another point of pressure on the worker the pressure to sign the card thats just increasing the pressure on the worker
6744690 the employers i talk to say that if workers want to organize thats fine we just want them to do it by secret ballot we dont want them harassed or intimidated by the union organizers
6744691 the unions just want a situation where they know they will always win

6744737 these timeless novels remind us of the great adventure stories from our youth and still impart their magic today at a time when we see children reading less and our literacy rates are a great worry the graphic novel has the potential to get reluctant readers engaged in these wonderful stories and hopefully encourage them to go on to read the book

6744797 bought a certain quantity of beef at two shillings a pound and the same quantity of sausages at eighteenpence a pound i pointed out to her that if she had divided the same money equally between beef and sausages she would have gained two pounds in the total weight can you tell me exactly how much she spent
6744798 but a lady who could pay such prices must be somewhat inexperienced in domestic economy
6744799 but you see that is not the precise point under discussion any more than the name and morals of the tradesman
6744800 i find i shall require no fewer than six current coins of the realm to pay for what i have bought
6744801 by a peculiar coincidence i am exactly in the same dilemma
6744802 in throwing these five pennies at the same time what are the chances that at least four of the coins will turn up either all heads or all tails
6744803 a man placed three sovereigns and one shilling in a bag how much should be paid for permission to draw one coin from it
6744804 i should be very glad if you could give me the answer to a little sum that has been worrying me a good deal lately here it is we have only been married a short time and now at the end of two years from the time when we set up housekeeping my husband tells me that he finds we have spent a third of his yearly income in rent rates and taxes one half in domestic expenses and one ninth in other ways he has a balance of 190 remaining in the bank i know this last because he accidentally left out his pass book the other day and i peeped into it dont you think that a husband ought to give his wife his entire confidence in his money matters well i do and will you believe it he has never told me what his income really is and i want very naturally to find out can you tell me what it is from the figures i have given you
6744805 is nineteen shillings and ninepence and i should like to know in just how many different ways it is possible for such an amount to be paid in the current coin of this realm
6744806 let me see four for threepence thats three for twopence two for a penny one for take one
6744807 of course not i gave you the apple for it
6744808 bless the woman you dont expect me to pay for the apple and the pear too
6744809 the apple woman has threepence hasnt she very well i have threepennyworth of apples and i have just given you the other threepence whats that but ninepence
6744810 it is not enough i ought to have a sixth
6744811 i aint a goin to tell yer jim but i beat the old cove down fourpence a hundred
6744812 the days of our years are threescore years and ten
6744813 let me think tommy well our three ages add up to exactly seventy years
6744814 thats a lot isnt it and how old are you papa
6744815 shall i ever be half as old as you papa
6744816 yes tommy and when that happens our three ages will add up to exactly twice as much as to day
6744817 and supposing i was born before you papa and supposing mamma had forgot all about it and hadnt been at home when i came and supposing
6744818 supposing tommy we talk about bed come along darling youll have a headache
6744819 is represented by the figures of my own age reversed he is my senior and the difference between our ages is one eleventh of their sum
6744820 yes and now the combined ages of the three girls are exactly equal to twice the combined ages of the two boys
6744821 do you know when the timpkinses married eighteen years ago timpkins was three times as old as his wife and to day he is just twice as old as she
6744822 then how old was mrs timpkins on the wedding day
6744823 i do not think you are old enough yet my dear
6744824 when i am only three times as old as you are you shall have one
6744825 do you know dear that in seven years time our combined ages will be sixty three years
6744826 is that really so and yet it is a fact that when you were my present age you were twice as old as i was then i worked it out last night
6744827 sister was four times older than the dog but now she is only three times as old
6744828 well you see it is like this at the time i was born i forget the year my only sister ann happened to be just one quarter the age of mother and she is now one third the age of father
6744829 but what i want is not the age of your sister ann but your own age
6744830 i am just a quarter of mothers present age and in four years time i shall be a quarter the age of father isnt that funny
6744831 our legislators are getting the marriage law into a frightful tangle here for example is a puzzling case that has come under my notice two brothers married two sisters one man died and the other mans wife also died then the survivors married
6744832 the man married his deceased wifes sister under the recent act
6744833 exactly and therefore under the civil law he is legally married and his child is legitimate but you see the man is the womans deceased husbands brother and therefore also under the civil law she is not married to him and her child is illegitimate
6744834 he is married to her and she is not married to him
6744835 quite so and the child is the legitimate son of his father but the illegitimate son of his mother
6744836 we lawyers try our best to break in the beast to the service of man our legislators are responsible for the breed
6744837 of a man in my parish who married the sister of his widow
6744838 married the sister of his widow do you marry dead men in your parish
6744839 no but i will explain that later well this man has a sister of his own their names are stephen brown and jane brown last week a young fellow turned up whom stephen introduced to me as his nephew naturally i spoke of jane as his aunt but to my astonishment the youth corrected me assuring me that though he was the nephew of stephen he was not the nephew of jane the sister of stephen this perplexed me a good deal but it is quite correct
6744840 oh yes you see that gentlemans mother was my mothers mother in law but he is not on speaking terms with my papa
6744841 i cant follow it my dear boy it makes me dizzy
6744842 well then reading about them if you want to be exact it just occurred to me that perhaps you three men may be interested in a little matter connected with myself
6744843 theres no difficulty in the matter when you rightly understand it
6744844 here stop wilson what was your nephew doing there you said your uncle
6744845 we are getting mixed was it your uncle or your nephew lets have it one way or the other
6744846 once for all are we to understand that both your uncle and your nephew were on the machine
6744847 phew im sorry to interrupt you again wilson but we cant get on like this is it true that the machine would only carry two
6744848 of course i said at the start that it only carried two
6744849 then what in the name of aerostation do you mean by saying that there were three persons on board
6744850 you have told us that parker your uncle and your nephew went up on this blessed flying machine
6744851 wilson i have known you for some time as a truthful man and a temperate man
6744852 but i am afraid since you took up that new line of goods you have overworked yourself
6744853 i see clearly where we all slipped a cog of course wilson you meant us to understand that parker is either your uncle or your nephew now we shall be all right if you will just tell us whether parker is your uncle or nephew
6744854 and its rather sad how thick headed some people are you dont seem to grip the facts it never seems to have occurred to either of you that my uncle and my nephew are one and the same man
6744855 yes david george linklater is my uncle and he is also my nephew consequently i am both his uncle and nephew queer isnt it ill explain how it comes about
6744856 can pull a load of a certain weight it is natural to suppose that four horses could pull a load of double that weight six horses a load of three times that weight yet strictly speaking such is not the case for the inference is based on the assumption that the four horses pull alike in amount and direction which in practice can scarcely ever be the case it so happens that we are frequently led in our reckonings to results which diverge widely from reality but the fault is not the fault of mathematics for mathematics always gives back to us exactly what we have put into it the ratio was constant according to that supposition the result is founded upon that supposition if the supposition is false the result is necessarily false
6744857 if you add one quarter of the time from noon till now to half the time from now till noon to morrow you will get the time exactly
6744858 this watch of mine does not keep perfect time i must have it seen to i have noticed that the minute hand and the hour hand are exactly together every sixty five minutes
6744859 what day of the week is this my good man
6744860 when the day after to morrow is yesterday to day will be as far from sunday as to day was from sunday when the day before yesterday was to morrow
6744861 one of the queerest characters i know is an old lame widow who climbs up a hill every week to draw her pension at the village post office she crawls up at the rate of a mile and a half an hour and comes down at the rate of four and a half miles an hour so that it takes her just six hours to make the double journey can any of you tell me how far it is from the bottom of the hill to the top
6744862 it is true that in ireland there are men of cork and in scotland men of ayr which is better still but in england there are lightermen
6744863 that spot is exactly eight inches from one wall and nine inches from the other can you tell me the diameter of the table without measuring it
6744864 possesses a string of thirty three pearls the middle pearl is the largest and best of all and the others are so selected and arranged that starting from one end each successive pearl is worth 100 more than the preceding one right up to the big pearl from the other end the pearls increase in value by 150 up to the large pearl the whole string is worth 65 000 what is the value of that large pearl
6744865 remind me of adam and eve authorities you may not know differ as to the number of apples that were eaten by adam and eve it is the opinion of some that eve 8 ate and adam 2 too a total of 10 only but certain mathematicians have figured it out differently and hold that eve 8 and adam a total of 16 yet the most recent investigators think the above figures entirely wrong for if eve 8 and adam 8 2 the total must be 90
6744866 it seems to me that if there were giants in those days probably eve 8 1 and adam 8 2 which would give a total of 163
6744867 it seems to me that if eve 8 1 and adam 8 1 2 they together consumed 893
6744868 for i consider that eve 8 1 4 adam and adam 8 1 2 4 eve so we get a total of 8 938
6744869 if eve 8 1 4 adam and adam 8 1 2 4 2 oblige eve surely the total must have been 82 056
6744870 and then my head will be twice as far below ground as it is now above ground
6744871 of course it is possible to work out just how long those two candles were burning to day ill have a shot at it
6744872 and you swear that he takes eight steps to your five
6744873 then i ask you constable as an intelligent man to explain how you ever caught him if that is the case
6744874 well you see i have got a longer stride in fact two of my steps are equal in length to five of the prisoners if you work it out you will find that the number of steps i required would bring me exactly to the spot where i captured him
6744875 and if i had done so two thirds of us would have retired
6744876 but if i had persuaded my friends mrs wild and christine armstrong to remain we should only have lost half our number
6744877 if 100 bushels of corn were distributed among 100 people in such a manner that each man received three bushels each woman two and each child half a bushel how many men women and children were there
6744878 i have cut my half of the field and you can do your share
6744879 you can divide my sheep into two different parts so that the difference between the two numbers is the same as the difference between their squares maybe mr parson you will like to work out the little sum for yourself
6744880 ill bet you half the money in my pocket on the toss of a coin heads i win tails i lose
6744881 was on the point of death when his wife was about to present him with a child i drew up his will in which he settled two thirds of his estate upon his son if it should happen to be a boy and one third on the mother but if the child should be a girl then two thirds of the estate should go to the mother and one third to the daughter as a matter of fact after his death twins were born a boy and a girl a very nice point then arose how was the estate to be equitably divided among the three in the closest possible accordance with the spirit of the dead mans will
6744882 the men of harold stood well together as their wont was and formed sixty and one squares with a like number of men in every square thereof and woe to the hardy norman who ventured to enter their redoubts for a single blow of a saxon war hatchet would break his lance and cut through his coat of mail
6744883 they were like unto a castle impenetrable to the normans
6744884 yes i am positive that i have more than three coins and equally certain that there are not so many as twenty five
6744885 all cannon balls are to be piled in square pyramids
6744886 all pyramids are to contain a square number of balls
6744887 look at this pyramid for example there are sixteen balls at the base then nine then four then one at the top making thirty balls in all but there must be six more balls or five fewer to make a square number
6744888 all you have to do is to put the right number of balls in your pyramids
6744889 which presents so simple a beginning as that of geometry there is none in which difficulties grow more rapidly as we proceed
6744890 to cut a half square into as few pieces as possible to form a greek cross
6744891 instead of picking out the cross entire and forming the square from four equal pieces can you cut out a square entire and four equal pieces that will form a perfect greek cross

6744900 this ingenious contrivance has for some time past been the favourite amusement of the ex emperor napoleon who being now in a debilitated state and living very retired passes many hours a day in thus exercising his patience and ingenuity
6744901 the result has been to show that the man tan the god tan and the book of tan are entirely unknown to chinese literature history or tradition by most of the learned men the name or allegation of the existence of these had never been heard of the puzzle is of course well known it is called in chinese chi chiao tu literally seven ingenious plan or ingenious puzzle figure of seven pieces no name approaching tangram or even tan occurs in chinese and the only suggestions for the latter were the chinese tan to extend or tang cantonese dialect for chinese it was suggested that probably some american or englishman who knew a little chinese or cantonese wanting a name for the puzzle might concoct one out of one of these words and the european ending gram i should say the name tangram was probably invented by an american some little time before 1864 and after 1847 but i cannot find it in print before the 1864 edition of webster i have therefore had to deal very shortly with the word in the dictionary telling what it is applied to and what conjectures or guesses have been made at the name and giving a few quotations one from your own article which has enabled me to make more of the subject than i could otherwise have done
6744902 they were brought to me by a cousin who has just returned from india now i want you to give me a little assistance you see i have decided to join them together so as to make one large square cushion cover how should i do this so as to mutilate the material as little as possible of course i propose to make my cuts only along the lines that divide the little chequers
6744903 how far have you to drive to your place from the railway station
6744904 if i get out at appleford it is just the same distance as if i go to bridgefield another fifteen miles farther on and if i changed at appleford and went thirteen miles from there to carterton it would still be the same distance you see i am equidistant from the three stations so i get a good choice of trains
6744905 because you can get an infinite number of different shapes with those four sides
6744906 that you told me once you had planted this tree equidistant from all the four corners of the garden
6744907 you seem to be a sharp youngster can you tell me this if i placed this ball on the level ground how many other balls of the same size could i lay around it also on the ground so that every ball should touch this one
6744908 if the surface of that ball contained just as many square feet as its volume contained cubic feet what would be the length of its diameter
6744909 the little maids papa has taken two different sized rectangular pieces of cardboard and has clipped off a triangular piece from one of them so that when it is suspended by a thread from the point a it hangs with the long side perfectly horizontal as shown in the illustration he has perplexed the child by asking her to find the point a on the other card so as to produce a similar result when cut and suspended by a thread

6744912 to remove eight of the almonds and leave the ninth in the central square you make the removals by jumping one almond over another to the vacant square beyond and taking off the one jumped over just as in draughts only here you can jump in any direction and not diagonally only the point is to do the thing in the fewest possible moves
6744913 ive got to go round and round the circle in the direction that you are looking and eat every thirteenth mouse but i must keep the white mouse for a tit bit at the finish thirteen is an unlucky number but i will do my best to oblige you
6744914 i dont know which of you to start at i must figure it out
6744915 how can we find a way that will enable us to dodge the mastodon and the plesiosaurus
6744916 how can we get there without ever crossing the track of the enemy
6744917 i have been watching that fly on the octahedron and it confines its walks entirely to the edges what can be its reason for avoiding the sides
6744918 supposing it to start from the top point how many different routes are there by which it may walk over all the edges without ever going twice along the same edge in any route
6744919 as there are thirty one passages each a furlong in length he will have to travel just thirty one furlongs
6744920 i am certain we can find a way of doing it
6744921 i wonder how many different routes there are from which i might have selected
6744922 place fifteen sheep in four pens so that there shall be the same number of sheep in each pen

6744924 one of the most perplexing things i have come across lately
6744925 is this eight men had been dining not wisely but too well at a certain london restaurant they were the last to leave but not one man was in a condition to identify his own hat now considering that they took their hats at random what are the chances that every man took a hat that did not belong to him
6744926 is to see in how many different ways the eight hats could be taken
6744927 multiply together the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 let me see half a minute yes there are 40 320 different ways
6744928 now all youve got to do is to see in how many of these cases no man has his own hat
6744929 i dont envy the man who attempts the task of writing out all those forty thousand odd cases and then picking out the ones he wants
6744930 that some of you fellows are very fond of rowing so i propose on this occasion to provide you with this recreation and at the same time give you an amusing little puzzle to solve during the seven days that you are at herne bay every one of you will go out every day at the same time for a row but there must always be three men in a boat and no more no two men may ever go out in a boat together more than once and no man is allowed to go out twice in the same boat if you can manage to do this and use as few different boats as possible you may charge the firm with the expense
6744931 i have no use for it i do not smoke
6744932 i have no use for it i do not play chess
6744933 miserable and heathenish men calling yourselves priests know ye not that to lay claim to a capacity to do anything better than my predecessor is a capital offence take that chessboard and before day dawns upon the torture chamber cut it into four equal parts of the same shape each containing sixteen perfect squares with one of the gems in each part if in this you fail then shall other sports be devised for your special delectation go
6744934 dost thou know that i came into this wicked world on a christmas even
6744935 and have i not often told thee that having been born on christmas even i have no love for the things that are odd look there
6744936 dost thou not see that the sixty four lights add up an even number vertically and horizontally but that all the diagonal lines except fourteen are of a number that is odd why is this
6744937 of a truth my lord abbot it is of the very nature of things and cannot be changed
6744938 nay but it shall be changed i command thee that certain of the lights be closed this day so that every line shall have an even number of lights see thou that this be done without delay lest the cellars be locked up for a month and other grievous troubles befall thee

6744940 he can only move two squares but makes up in the quality of his locomotion for its quantity for he can spring one square sideways and one forward simultaneously like a cat can stand on one leg in the middle of the board and jump to any one of eight squares he chooses can get on one side of a fence and blackguard three or four men on the other has an objectionable way of inserting himself in safe places where he can scare the king and compel him to move and then gobble a queen for pure cussedness the knight has no equal and when you chase him out of one hole he skips into another
6744941 chesse play is a good and wittie exercise of the minde for some kinde of men
6744942 that is my friends last move and i am considering my reply
6744943 but you really must excuse me the position seems utterly impossible
6744944 i see you are a beginner you play to win
6744945 you have much to learn my friend and myself do not play for results of that antiquated kind we seek in chess the wonderful the whimsical the weird did you ever see a position like that
6744946 that position sir materializes the sinuous evolvements and syncretic synthetic and synchronous concatenations of two cerebral individualities
6744947 a curious little point occurred to me in my dispensary this morning
6744948 i had a bottle containing ten ounces of spirits of wine and another bottle containing ten ounces of water i poured a quarter of an ounce of spirits into the water and shook them up together the mixture was then clearly forty to one then i poured back a quarter ounce of the mixture so that the two bottles should again each contain the same quantity of fluid what proportion of spirits to water did the spirits of wine bottle then contain
6744949 what part of the mixture is wine and what part water
6744950 she wants twenty pounds of tea at 2 s 4 d per lb of course we have a good 2 s 6 d tea a slightly inferior at 2 s 3 d and a cheap indian at 1 s 9 d but she is very particular always about her prices
6744951 why just mix up the three teas in different proportions so that the twenty pounds will work out fairly at the ladys price only dont put in more of the best tea than you can help as we make less profit on that and of course you will use only our complete pound packets dont do any weighing

6744955 that between two players who both thoroughly understand the play every game should be drawn neither player could ever win except through the blundering of his opponent but i am writing from the point of view of the student of these things
6744956 i pg 119 divide them into three unequal heaps let me see we have 14 11 and 5 as it happens now the two players draw alternately any number from any one heap and he who draws the last match loses the game thats all i will play with you wilson i have formed the heaps so you have the first draw
6744957 suppose i exhibit my usual moderation and take all the 14 heap
6744958 that is the worst you could do for it loses right away i take 6 from the 11 leaving two equal heaps of 5 and to leave two equal heaps is a certain win with the single exception of 1 1 because whatever you do in one heap i can repeat in the other if you leave 4 in one heap i leave 4 in the other if you then leave 2 in one heap i leave 2 in the other if you leave only 1 in one heap then i take all the other heap if you take all one heap i take all but one in the other no you must never leave two heaps unless they are equal heaps and more than 1 1 lets begin again
6744959 i will take 6 from the 14 and leave you 8 11 5
6744960 you shall all be set free if you can solve this puzzle you must so arrange yourselves in the sixteen cells that the numbers on your backs shall form a magic square in which every column every row and each of the two diagonals shall add up the same only remember this that in no case may two of you ever be together in the same cell
6744961 a very remarkable magic square of 8 in two degrees has been constructed by m pfeffermann in other words he has managed to dispose the sixty four first numbers on the squares of a chessboard in such a way that the sum of the numbers in every line every column and in each of the two diagonals shall be the same and more that if one substitutes for all the numbers their squares the square still remains magic
6744962 printed in 1767 mentions the floor of the great guard chamber in the abbey of st
6744963 the middle whereof represents a maze or labyrinth about 10 feet diameter and so artfully contrived that were we to suppose a man following all the intricate meanders of its volutes he could not travel less than a mile before he got from one end to the other
6744964 from the continual attrition it has received from thousands of tracing fingers a central group of theseus and the minotaur has now been very nearly effaced

6744967 a man has just designed a square house in such a cunning manner that all the windows on the four sides have a south aspect
6744968 for i cannot endure a room with a north aspect
6744969 i suppose he puts bay windows on the east and west sides but how on earth can be contrive to look south from the north side does he use mirrors or something of that kind
6744970 nothing of the sort all the windows are flush with the walls and yet you get a southerly prospect from every one of them you see there is no real difficulty in designing the house if you select the proper spot for its erection now this house is designed for a gentleman who proposes to build it exactly at the north pole if you think a moment you will realize that when you stand at the north pole it is impossible no matter which way you may turn to look elsewhere than due south there are no such directions as north east or west when you are exactly at the north pole everything is due south
6744971 that however much you might like the aspect the situation would be a little too bracing for you
6744972 your uncle john fell also into the trap i am no good at catches and puzzles i suppose i havent the right sort of brain perhaps some one will explain this to me only last week i remarked to my hairdresser that it had been said that there are more persons in the world than any one of them has hairs on his head he replied then it follows madam that two persons at least must have exactly the same number of hairs on their heads if this is a fact i confess i cannot see it
6744973 who havent a solitary hair on their heads discoverable under a magnifying glass we will leave them out of the question still i dont see how you are to prove that at least two persons have exactly the same number to a hair
6744974 assume the population of the world to be only one million any number will do as well as another then your statement was to the effect that no person has more than nine hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine hairs on his head is that so
6744975 very well then as there are only nine hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine different ways of bearing hair it is clear that the millionth person must repeat one of those ways do you see
6744976 yes i see that at least i think i see it
6744977 therefore two persons at least must have the same number of hairs on their heads and as the number of people on the earth so greatly exceeds the number of hairs on any one persons head there must of course be an immense number of these repetitions
6744978 why could not the millionth man have say ten thousand hairs and a half
6744979 that is mere hair splitting willie and does not come into the question
6744980 if a thousand soldiers are drawn up in battle array on a plane
6744981 if a billiard table were quite level that is a perfect plane the balls ought to roll to the centre
6744982 there is a certain island situated between england and france and yet that island is farther from france than england is what is the island
6744983 that seems absurd my boy because if i place this tumbler to represent the island between these two plates it seems impossible that the tumbler can be farther from either of the plates than they are from each other
6744984 well then i think you will find uncle that guernsey is about twenty six miles from france and england is only twenty one miles from france between calais and dover
6744985 has been trying to induce me to accept the axiom that if equals be multiplied by equals the products are equal
6744986 for example if 3 feet equal 1 yard then twice 3 feet will equal 2 yards do you see
6744987 is this tumbler half full of water equal to a similar glass half empty
6744988 then it follows from the axiom that a glass full must equal a glass empty is that correct
6744989 no clearly not i never thought of it in that light
6744990 just what i was thinking allgood it would seem that we must make an exception in the case of liquids
6744991 if we also had to except the case of solids for instance let us take the solid earth one mile square equals one square mile therefore two miles square must equal two square miles is this so
6744992 if the axiom is not true in these cases when is it true
6744993 by what fractional part does four fourths exceed three fourths
6744994 do you mean to say that it isnt one fourth
6744995 you will soon be without a friend in the world
6744996 can any of you write down quickly in figures twelve thousand twelve hundred and twelve pounds
6744997 i have been waiting to ask you all a question in the massacre of the innocents under herod a number of poor little children were buried in the sand with only their feet sticking out how might you distinguish the boys from the girls
6744998 it is a conundrum something to do with their poor little souls
6744999 we wont have that one i knew two men in my youth who were once the best of friends but they quarrelled over that infernal thing of zenos and they never spoke to one another again for the rest of their lives i draw the line at that and the other stupid thing by zeno about the flying arrow i dont believe anybody understands them because i could never do so myself
6745000 oh very well then father here is another the post office people were about to erect a line of telegraph posts over a high hill from turmitville to wurzleton but as it was found that a railway company was making a deep level cutting in the same direction they arranged to put up the posts beside the line now the posts were to be a hundred yards apart the length of the road over the hill being five miles and the length of the level cutting only four and a half miles how many posts did they save by erecting them on the level
6745001 find how many times one hundred yards will go in five miles and how many times in four and a half miles then deduct one from the other and you have the number of posts saved by the shorter route
6745002 but it is quite wrong if you look at this sketch that i have just made you will see that there is no difference whatever if the posts are a hundred yards apart just the same number will be required on the level as over the surface of the hill
6745003 for if the posts are a hundred yards apart and it is half a mile farther over the hill you have to put up posts on that extra half mile
6745004 look at the diagram mother you will see that the distance from post to post is not the distance from base to base measured along the ground i am just the same distance from you if i stand on this spot on the carpet or stand immediately above it on the chair
6745005 suppose the earth were a perfect sphere with a smooth surface and a girdle of steel were placed round the equator so that it touched at every point
6745006 ill put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes
6745007 now if six yards were added to the length of the girdle what would then be the distance between the girdle and the earth supposing that distance to be equal all round
6745008 i do not suppose the distance would be worth mentioning
6745009 well without calculating i should imagine it would be a very minute fraction of an inch
6745010 to learn that those extra six yards would make the distance from the earth all round the girdle very nearly a yard
6745011 did you hear the story of the extraordinary precocity of mrs perkinss baby that died last week
6745012 it was only three months old and lying at the point of death when the grief stricken mother asked the doctor if nothing could save it absolutely nothing said the doctor then the infant looked up pitifully into its mothers face and said absolutely nothing
6745013 the truth of which has often been carefully attested but are you sure this really happened mrs allgood
6745014 but do you really think it astonishing that a child of three months should say absolutely nothing what would you expect it to say
6745015 i knew two men father and son who died in the same battle during the south african war they were both named andrew johnson and buried side by side but there was some difficulty in distinguishing them on the headstones what would you have done
6745016 they should have described one as andrew johnson senior and the other as andrew johnson junior
6745017 but i forgot to tell you that the father died first
6745018 well you see they wanted to be absolutely exact and that was the difficulty
6745019 it is like this if the father died first the son was then no longer junior is that so
6745020 that is just what they wanted to be strictly exact now if he was no longer junior then he did not die junior
6745021 that i have just remembered a man wrote to me the other day that he had recently discovered two old coins while digging in his garden one was dated 51 b c and the other one marked george i how do i know that he was not writing the truth
6745022 perhaps you know the man to be addicted to lying
6745023 but that would be no proof that he was not telling the truth in this instance
6745024 you know that there were no coins made at those dates
6745025 my friend did not state and i really cannot see willie that it makes any difference
6745026 the letters b c would never be used on a coin made before the birth of christ they never anticipated the event in that way the letters were only adopted later to denote dates previous to those which we call a d that is very good but i cannot see why the other statement could not be correct
6745027 yes but they would not know it until there was a george ii
6745028 then there was no george ii until george iii came to the throne
6745029 then the first george was george i on account of there having been no king of that name before him
6745030 we did not call queen victoria victoria i but if there is ever a victoria ii then she will be known that way
6745031 but there have been several georges and therefore he was george i there havent been several victorias so the two cases are not similar
6745032 that i should like some of you to settle for me i am accustomed to buy from our greengrocer bundles of asparagus each 12 inches in circumference i always put a tape measure round them to make sure i am getting the full quantity the other day the man had no large bundles in stock but handed me instead two small ones each 6 inches in circumference that is the same thing i said and of course the price will be the same but he insisted that the two bundles together contained more than the large one and charged me a few pence extra now what i want to know is which of us was correct would the two small bundles contain the same quantity as the large one or would they contain more
6745033 of the sack of corn that sempronius borrowed from caius which your greengrocer perhaps had been reading about somewhere he caught you beautifully
6745034 on the contrary you were both wrong and you were badly cheated you only got half the quantity that would have been contained in a large bundle and therefore ought to have been charged half the original price instead of more
6745035 there is a man in the next village who eats two eggs for breakfast every morning
6745036 if you told us that the two eggs ate the man it would be interesting
6745037 this man neither buys borrows barters begs steals nor finds the eggs he doesnt keep hens and the eggs are not given to him how does he get the eggs
6745038 a strange hen comes into his place and lays them
6745039 if so he could not return them after they were eaten so that would be stealing them
6745040 he would have to get them first wouldnt he the question was how does he get them
6745041 i didnt did i mr filkins i said he doesnt keep hens
6745042 you cannot give a man his own property can you
6745043 you see there are sixty four squares eight by eight now i draw a straight line from the top left hand corner where the first and second squares meet to the bottom right hand corner i cut along this line with the scissors slide up the piece that i have marked b and then clip off the little corner c by a cut along the first upright line this little piece will exactly fit into its place at the top and we now have an oblong with seven squares on one side and nine squares on the other there are therefore now only sixty three squares because seven multiplied by nine makes sixty three where on earth does that lost square go to i have tried over and over again to catch the little beggar but he always eludes me for the life of me i cannot discover where he hides himself
6745044 it seems to be like the other old chessboard fallacy and perhaps the explanation is the same
6745045 but curiously enough i have never actually counted them my mother once pointed out to me that if you start from the centre and count up one line along the outside and down the next line there are always eight rubies so i should always know if a stone were missing
6745046 if you count up one line from the centre along the edge and down the next line in any direction there are always eight stones this was always so and is so now how therefore would it be possible to remove a stone without my detecting it
6745047 i know the brooch well it originally contained forty five stones and there are now only forty one somebody has stolen four rubies and then reset as small a number of the others as possible in such a way that there shall always be eight in any of the directions you have mentioned
6745048 ive just been pheasant shooting with my friend the duke we had splendid sport and i made some wonderful shots what do you think of this for instance perhaps you can twist it into a puzzle the duke and i were crossing a field when suddenly twenty four pheasants rose on the wing right in front of us i fired and two thirds of them dropped dead at my feet then the duke had a shot at what were left and brought down three twenty fourths of them wounded in the wing now out of those twenty four birds how many still remained
6745049 the illustration is a fancy sketch of my correspondent simple simon in the act of trying to solve the following innocent little arithmetical puzzle a race between a man and a woman that i happened to witness one all fools day has fixed itself indelibly on my memory it happened at a country house where the gardener and the cook decided to run a race to a point 100 feet straight away and return i found that the gardener ran 3 feet at every bound and the cook only 2 feet but then she made three bounds to his two now what was the result of the race
6745050 it has been suggested that perhaps there is a catch in the return but there is not the race is to a point 100 feet away and home again that is a distance of 200 feet one correspondent asks whether they take exactly the same time in turning to which i reply that they do another seems to suspect that it is really a conundrum and that the answer is that the result of the race was a matrimonial tie but i had no such intention the puzzle is an arithmetical one as it purports to be
6745051 can you point out that mans wife they are stopping at the same hotel as i am and the lady is one of those in view
6745052 we may at once exclude that sister of mercy and the girl in the short frock also the woman selling oranges it cannot be the lady in widows weeds it is not the lady in the bath chair because she is not staying at your hotel for i happened to see her come out of a private house this morning assisted by her maid the two ladies in red breakfasted at my hotel this morning and as they were not wearing outdoor dress i conclude they are staying there it therefore rests between the lady in blue and the one with the green parasol but the left hand that holds the parasol is you see ungloved and bears no wedding ring consequently i am driven to the conclusion that the lady in blue is the mans wife and you say this is correct
6745053 i dont believe he would marry a girl like number 7
6745054 i am sure a nice girl like number 3 would not marry such a fellow
6745055 it must be number 1 because she has got as far away as possible from the brute
6745056 for that very reason if he is really looking at her i should say that she is not his wife
6745057 we have spent a third of his yearly income in rent
6745058 a man went into a shop to buy chestnuts he said he wanted a pennyworth and was given five chestnuts it is not enough i ought to have a sixth of a chestnut more he remarked but if i give you one chestnut more the shopman replied you will have five sixths too many now strange to say they were both right how many chestnuts should the buyer receive for half a crown
6745059 mary is 27 twice as old as ann was 13 when mary was half as old 24 as ann will be 49 when ann is three times as old 49 as mary was 16 when mary was 16 three times as old as ann 5
6745060 you are my fathers brother in law because my father married your sister kate you are my brothers father in law because my brother alfred married your daughter mary and you are my brother because my wife jane was your brother henrys daughter
6745061 it was a cold dreary winters afternoon and by the time the hands of the clock on my mantelpiece joined forces and stood at twenty minutes past four my chambers were well nigh as dark as midnight
6745062 how soon after xii oclock will a clock with both hands of the same length be ambiguous
6745063 a little larger or a good deal smaller in proportion
6745064 we must remember gentlemen that although every cock is a hen every hen is not a cock
6745065 having no compasses here i was compelled to improvise a pair with the aid of a small penknife a bit of firewood from a bundle a piece of tin from a toy engine a tin tack and two portions of a hairpin for points they are a fairly serviceable pair of compasses and i shall keep them as a memento of your puzzle
6745066 so that each son shall receive land of exactly the same area and exactly similar in shape

6745084 one of the reasons scotland didnt take to lady thatcher was because of that
6745085 we didnt mind the economic side so much but we didnt like the social side at all
6745086 margaret thatcher could have only ever read the penguin edition of wealth of nations and she missed out the moral sentiments
6745087 im well on the record as never having approved of either margaret thatchers social or economic policies thats clear if you look at the interview
6745088 i was commenting on why scots in particular were so deeply resentful of margaret thatcher and i strongly believe that her social message of no such thing as society and the poll tax cut against the grain of scotlands social conscience
6745089 that doesnt mean that the nation liked her economic policies just that we liked her social policies even less
6745090 i have never approved of either margaret thatchers economic or social policies as is clear from the very next passage of the full interview where i say that if scottish economic founder adam smith could sue for the misuse of his thoughts by thatcherites they would be in real trouble

6745094 we respect the california commission and the job they do we always enjoy working with them and work very well together the illegal use of steroids is a problem in all major sports including mixed martial arts we certainly do not condone the use of steroids but we also support trust and have confidence in our fighter antonio silva who has denied ever taken any illegal substance including steroids and is prepared to challenge the results of the california commission so until all the facts are known and a final decision is rendered elitexc will reserve making any further comments at this time

6745115 how a mock trial could turn victory into defeat on north koreas nuclear arms
6745116 the syria story is complete nonsense no one in a position to know has said anything about nuclear transfer if you go read carefully what officials have been saying they have not said that
6745117 this is another one of those games that the boltons of the world play when they see the negotiating track getting serious
6745118 which is they throw some threat on the table to try to derail talks that turns out not to be quite the threat they made of it they exaggerated the uranium enrichment program and tried to use it to block negotiations and they did so successfully for a while
6745119 from what i have seen there is simply no evidence what so ever of any north korean nuclear connection to syria my guess is that at the end of the day we will learn the israelis found something quite different
6745120 at first the mood was tense we from the 5 a m shift didnt go back in until 8 30

6745128 i think it all depends on pakistan and what they have to say on the security issue
6745129 if pakistan says the country is safe to play in and the tournament can be held on schedule they have our support
6745130 i cant say what the bcci stance would be should the tournament be cancelled or moved from pakistan
6745131 in any case it is not possible for us to play in a tournament in pakistan because india has a full series in pakistan later in the year
6745132 spending behind the united states presidential election and around the beijing olympic games should continue to boost 2008 revenues
6745133 levels of activity in 2008 should match those seen in 2007 and there are significant new business opportunities
6745134 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6745135 in addition the new united states president will have to wrestle with twin fiscal and budget deficits in early 2009 and post the olympics chinese growth may slow due to inflationary particularly food price concerns and the impact that a weakening united states economy has on the rest of the world
6745136 position the group very well to weather any economic slowdown
6745137 despite these shorter term uncertainties the prospects for trading performance improvements at wpp remain good

6745181 these two media reports released on the same day is no coincidence
6745182 junior senator obama has studied the speeches and mannerisms of john f kennedy and has adopted the casual spin the truth style of bill clinton that approach has him in line for the democratic presidential nomination and positioned him as a strong candidate for u s president but the presidency is clearly not enough for obama he wants to one up both kennedy and clinton kennedy introduced the u s space program but never flew in space clinton banged interns in the oval office and presumably on air force one but never outside earths atmosphere obama wants to bang interns in outer space im only saying this because its true theres no getting around it when viewed together the articles speak for themselves
6745183 president obama would never try and change the way nasa operates just so he can copulate outside of our planets atmosphere he doesnt like change that much thats why he uses old style chicago politics
6745184 if hannity would have read the wall street journal also published on wednesday hed have seen the headline obama played by chicago rules chicago rules dont give a rats ass about sex in space theyre all about using legal technicalities dirty dealing and working with racketeers like tony rezko to get elected and seize power once again conservatives are trying to take a couple of unrelated news stories and one liberals desire for change and turn them into something crazy well we can be crazy enough without their help bill clinton proved that

6745189 honestly who would have believed me if i told you five years ago that in 2008 the u s would elect as president a junior senator with virtually no political experience and zero business skills a man who spent 20 years in an anti american church with a pastor whose buddy is louis farrakhan a candidate with the pentagon bomber as his good friend and who had an imprisoned racketeer as a real estate partner

6745223 we have to take note that 70 of our petroleum products are being consumed by the transport sector prices when moving daily or weekly affects the fare schemes which we have to admit takes a long time to be granted
6745224 its public transport fare adjustment process a complicated thing and what we can only do for now is to help each other mitigate the impact thats why we have these dialogues so people will have a clearer picture and understanding
6745225 even if oil firms implement a p1 liter or p0 50 liter decrease in pump prices now it is still not enough since we are pegging a fare decrease at p47 liter now its at p55 liter
6745226 that is why it is best that oil firms implement a big rollback and not think about profits as of the moment
6745227 we are continuously evaluating but it will still be determined by market forces

6745284 the big challenge for the team here at wtg was that we were dealing with a service coming close to the end of its lifecycle we had to deal with end users of the site who were used to the way it works but were migrating from entering claims to their management through the process of settlement the fact that we are able to ensure that the servers and software are supported and maintained for the life of the project while ensuring that solicitors can still access the information for their clients means that we were able to deliver against objective and budget

6745303 elegy has nothing to do with faithfulness and everything to do with interpretation
6745304 the dying animal with its unloving encounters maddening woman troubles and occasional gynecological descriptions really cries out for a reckless voluptuary like catherine breillat who wouldnt go all soft

6745426 eine kr ftige roulade oder ein schmackhafter braten sind doch gerade im winter eine feine sache das finden auch unsere g ste steht roulade auf der karte ist sie ruckzuck weg

6745432 aunque hayan robado contenidos protegidos por derechos de autor creo que hay mejores formas de resolver esto con las herramientas que disponemos como desarrolladores
6745433 a la vez creo que hay mejores soluciones que perseguir a la gente por dinero no s cuales son aparte de crear experiencias interactivas que hagan m s dif cil mantener el mismo nivel de juego cuando es pirata
6745434 debemos aprender de otras industrias ya que la industria audiovisual no ha ganado amigos denunciando a los consumidores
6745435 what a pleasant surprise such a nice change from normal
6745436 i hate to see a good bunch of boys go out against top competition and lose like that
6745437 we just beat them on defense but they got what counts the score that pass receiver homan is what really hurt us we contained him better than i expected but he made a couple of big plays that hurt us
6745438 i hope our team takes this ranking as a motivating factor as something to uphold then it is a positive
6745439 if they think we have arrived believe we have accomplished something and become complacent then it is a negative we wont shy away from it but it will put a target on us i am sure it will motivate alabama

6745443 what were seeing in business in our retail businesses or anything having to do with housing is even a further slowing down in june and july both in terms of credit experience where people first got in trouble with house payments and now credit card payments
6745444 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6745445 die bayern haben probleme wie wir sie auch haben viele spieler waren bei l nderspielen sie wie wir haben ein paar verletzte
6745446 in diesem spiel wird es nicht um qualit t gehen sondern um mentalit t da kann man immer besser sein als der gegner
6745447 wir spielen gegen die beste mannschaft deutschlands aber wir spielen in unserem stadion

6745459 at first you may think that rob is just a straightforward bad guy but there is more to him than that and his relationship with stevie shows his vulnerable side
6745460 his history with stevie goes back a long way and as the relationship is revisited it is a question of whether their conflicting priorities will drive them apart or not it is a choice between duty or love

6745480 it seems like suspending itunes is punishment for itunes but really it doesnt hurt itunes it hurts us
6745481 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the chinese government
6745482 we believe the irish people should not ignore this conflict in the caucasus it could have implications for ireland if the lisbon treaty is ever forced upon us under the lisbon treaty all eu countries including ireland would be obliged to come to the aid of other eu states that are attacked georgia has already applied for eu and nato membership so this is a predicament we could face in the future if the lisbon treaty becomes a reality

6745487 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
6745488 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6745489 dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee
6745490 instead of invoking paris britney and obscure sixties radicals sen
6745491 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old
6745492 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6745493 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines
6745494 uh looks like someone had a big party in the forest
6745495 the man calls me gabriel so everyone around here does too
6745496 no the man says these were made when i fell from up there
6745497 no and im also the only one of the seven who was not born a human
6745498 there are only seven doors and yours is the last one oh i must go the others should have woken up by now
6745499 were not the only ones with colored eyes around here you know
6745500 unlike credit card fraud where you can go back and seize that toaster or lcd television they bought how do you go back in there and get somebodys heart
6745501 this is the first time in my 12 years ive seen anything like this
6745502 you cant just walk in with somebodys medicaid card like its a credit card and have heart surgery done
6745503 a doctor would need to know blood type cardiac history medical history and other comprehensive records that just couldnt be faked this doesnt make sense
6745504 when this was brought to our attention by police we immediately launched a review
6745505 this gentleman apparently took pretty significant steps to steal this mans identity were taking all the precautions we can
6745506 i think people do what they have to do sometimes
6745507 end of september were hoping to start a new record i cant really talk about it at the moment but as far as were concerned its booked and were going in to start recording properly around then were really excited about it though we really are
6745508 were all really looking forward to playing the heavenly 18th birthday festival i dont think weve ever played spectators of suicide or we her majestys prisoners live and we certainly havent played starlover for 15 years its going to be really exciting very odd to see a lot of old faces sean read our keyboard player is guesting in at least three bands over the weekend no idea how he does it
6745509 i love ibiza absolutely up for it the ibiza rocks hotel kind of reminded me of johnny cash at folsom prison as i walked out to the baying crowd of prisoners
6745510 in fact no it was gladiatorial i was russell crowe blood thirsty claustrophobic hot the perfect holiday crowd

6745512 that would be sort of like putting the defendant in a candy store
6745513 ive been around animals my whole life and never had an incident
6745514 i can tell you from experience the tears i cried over a 5 foot water monitor were every bit as hard as the one i cried over a 125 pound rottweiler scales fur and feathers it all hurts just the same when your pet dies
6745515 ethel especially loved strawberries which we found hilarious because her hips would get red and it looked like she was wearing lipstick
6745516 i believe this is a perfectly appropriate use of the space
6745517 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6745518 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6745519 the russian georgia conflict has disrupted supplies and it looks like it will drag on and create a lot of uncertainty
6745520 hes not dane cook hes got a more sophisticated everyday take on things he often comes across as a questioner of conventional wisdom but also can be kind of a crank its a fine line to walk when youre dealing with a younger person
6745521 the problem with the olympics is that they only come up every four years
6745522 thats what it comes down to our athletes have a profile for a very short time
6745523 its always hard for track and field athletes because theyre not really known in the general media the public arent really aware of them for the most part because its a big sport but its not always on the main field of what theyre looking at
6745524 the sponsors really need to see a return on their investment and theres a lot of competition with other sports

6745544 the mechanic suffered an electric shock after touching the sidepod and steering wheel of the car
6745545 there was a high frequency ac voltage between these contact points the cause of which has been traced back to the kers control unit and a sporadic capacitive coupling from the high voltage network to the twelve volt network
6745546 the voltage ran through the wiring of the twelve volt network to the steering wheel and through the carbon chassis back to the control unit the problem was caused by a sporadic error in the control unit

6745565 he has two years left but for him it would be an important step if villarreal were to offer him a new deal
6745566 fenerbahces offer is worth a lot of money many millions they want to build a strong side and aragones knows what marcos is capable of

6745571 i do not regard our national debt as unduly alarming
6745572 weve overcome things far worse than what is going on right now
6745573 what concerns me more than anything is our savings rate
6745574 the problem is getting the public understanding and the political will to do something about it
6745575 the important thing to remember is that the pie gets larger over time and theres more to divide up
6745576 in the time period leading to the two national conventions and the inauguration that are all scheduled in the next 5 months the number of incidents will likely be on the rise

6745584 blown to bits your life liberty and happiness after the digital explosion

6745587 we are pleased to be able to offer the airs system at a significant discount with free training to nlc and iafc members
6745588 based on the interest we generated during the webcast we want to insure we make the airs system economically accessible to all municipalities and fire chiefs wishing to deploy airs and its life saving features
6745589 the airs system has the capability to save lives and allow first responders to more efficiently manage their resources while providing a level of situational awareness not achieved prior to the use of this technology
6745590 it is critical that new technologies be applied in the fire service to help us help our own if they get trapped
6745591 if you can enable a rapid intervention team rit with the technology to find a downed firefighter with precision youve given them a fighting chance at reaching them in time to save one of their own there can be nothing more important to a firefighter than saving one of our own
6745592 we are pleased to be able make cities aware of this promising new technology through nlc tv
6745593 city officials are always looking for new solutions to e protect first responders in the line of duty
6745594 this technology was originally developed for the us dept of defenses
6745595 now that its being adopted by commercial companies for tracking and monitoring the status of shipments the price has dropped dramatically so that it can be deployed at a reasonable cost the lives of our first responders are invaluable so now that the price is reasonable we want cities to be able to take advantage of these advances in networked people trackers and sensors
6745596 we had significant traffic for this nlc tv webcast including viewership from the first responder community and fire chiefs nationally
6745597 the airs system is attracting a lot of attention across the country as we continue to see growing traffic to the video archive of the webcast over the last several weeks becomes more viral in the community
6745598 expects russia to abide by its agreement to withdraw forces

6745606 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6745607 that doesnt mean that the equity cant get wiped out and it almost has in a practical sense as institutions they dont have any net worth people who own their insured mortgages or own their debt nothing is going to happen to them the equity and preferred stock is another question
6745608 just go right to the pound and find yourself a hound and make that doggie proud cause thats what its all about

6745632 no one gets 100 percent of what they would like to happen but me and my agent are happy
6745633 to have someone of genes age and the way he carried himself to all of a sudden receive a phone call that gene has passed away was a huge shock to me from where the union started to where it is today is leaps and bounds a lot of that credit has to go to gene and what he stood for
6745634 with the backing of the players he was able to get us in a pretty good position in terms of health benefits with help from the presidents at the time be it troy and trace armstrong
6745635 its been no secret that this has been troys ambition for a while
6745636 gene made some strong statements about not planning to leave im sure a number of people will want the position but i think troy will be high on the list of qualified people
6745637 troy is the kind of guy who can make things happen
6745638 he was a very competent president and a very involved president he took the job extremely seriously and handled the position as well as anyone has my initial gut reaction is that troy has a pretty good chance of getting the job
6745639 i dont want fans to get on him for my situation
6745640 for me the highs and lows of watching that game were gut wrenching
6745641 i was out of my seat in the locker room
6745642 i was into it im a fan and i care a lot about heather i was more emotional watching that game than i am playing in one of my own they werent expected to win that game and heather after her injury wasnt supposed to be on that team so for her to be on that roster and to play and have them win it i couldnt be any prouder
6745643 ive talked to heather a couple times since she sent me the text
6745644 i know theyre exhausted but i imagine theyll find some energy to celebrate
6745645 they were good last year and gave us everything we wanted last year with a backup quarterback
6745646 hes doing great wouldnt you 60 million richer hes doing wonderful
6745647 if hes injured he cant play so we cant do anything about that
6745648 we have to get better as a team without him
6745649 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game
6745650 his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6745651 gene always believed the best way to build the popularity of our sport was to craft a dynamic partnership between the players and the owners that served the best interest of the fans
6745652 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6745653 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but didnt always do so he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6745654 a lot of hits he took were because a lot of people couldnt believe this black former football player was accomplishing what he was accomplishing
6745655 and we all know what a deal the last deal was and thats why the owners got out of it i dont think he ever got the credit he shouldve gotten for that because of the lack of acrimony between him and tagliabue and the last two years
6745656 the further you get away from how they led up to the deal and you look back and you realize what the union came away with i think that becomes the legacy the one big piece that i think was still in the process was this idea of the broader issue of retired players how you take care of them with injuries and the like it is kind of a sad additional piece to think about that he too becomes someone who dies young football players die young it keeps happening
6745657 he has meant a tremendous amount to the players union and was pivotal in creating the stature and footing they have today
6745658 we have knocked heads recently over issues relating to the treatment of former nfl players and the execution of the current disability system i disagreed with gene with regard the fact that there are major flaws in the disability program and on the nflpas treatment of retired players the problem still exists and needs to be addressed but today is not the time to talk about those issues or the future it is a time to extend condolences to his family
6745659 funziona cos io faccio finta di andarmene ma visto che insistete torno indietro
6745660 i was addicted to crack cocaine i was a criminal i was on the run i was hiding out in a local hotel hoping my probation officer wouldnt find me
6745661 on any other day the officers on bay seemed countless now when i needed one most a cop was nowhere to be found
6745662 i ended up running into a guy i used to get high with
6745663 he was now clean and he told me about the urban training institute and clean start program at the old savannah city mission so i decided to give it a try not because i wanted to get clean but because i thought it would be a good place to hide out
6745664 i went in under the name thomas jenkins or tj
6745665 one of the pre requisites for clean start is that the candidate must be very mature in his misery
6745666 it sounds harsh but if youre not sick and tired of being sick and tired it too easy to slip back into old ways tj was beyond ready for a change
6745667 a student must be willing to live in and relate to a community of christians they must be teachable willing to study to learn and to change they must also agree to community service without compensation and work as permitted with required tithing savings and restitution plus they must develop a vibrant connection with other believers in an approved church
6745668 on march 15th 2005 i accepted jesus christ as my lord and savior i was no longer scared i no longer wanted to hide
6745669 i told everyone my real name and that day healing started
6745670 i told him that i was a changed man for good and i know he had heard that a million times before but i truly believe to this day that the holy spirit touched him because i was facing 6 years in jail for my offenses and he gave me another chance
6745671 my life was changed at old savannah city mission im not the man i was when i first walked through the missions doors
6745672 id definitely be i jail if i hadnt enrolled and if i ever got out of jail im sure id still be a criminal
6745673 ich konnte mir nie vorstellen dass es jemals wieder so einen pr sidenten geben k nnte der wie mein vater die menschen beeinflusst hat doch mit obama haben wir jetzt einen mann gefunden der so ein pr sident sein k nnte nicht nur f r mich sondern f r eine neue generation amerikas

6745681 we are going through times when the value of all commodities including scrap metal is particularly high and its leading quite literally to highway robbery
6745682 after a spate of thefts a couple of years ago we started to work with our contractors to replace our signage where possible with this new low value non recyclable material

6745690 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6745691 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6745692 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6745693 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6745694 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6745695 zu beginn der vorbereitung war das kein problem weil man die athletik auch mit zwei spielern trainieren kann die anderen wurden ja optimal bei den nationalteams vorbereitet im spielerischen bereich war es schon schwieriger da mussten wir viel in zweier oder dreier gruppen arbeiten
6745696 nat rlich aber die haben ja auch auf hohem niveau gespielt und viele ja auch miteinander wir hatten mit kaufmann erst kurz vor olympia beginn verletzt ausgefallen die red kehrmann und kraus ja drei spieler in der deutschen mannschaft dabei die dann so wie im klub zusammen gespielt haben deshalb mache ich mir da nicht so viele sorgen andere mannschaften aus der bundesliga trifft das ja genauso
6745697 da deutschland ja schon in der vorrunde ausgeschieden ist hatten die spieler eine woche zeit sich zu erholen und werden dann nach ende der olympischen spiele wieder beim training sein
6745698 wir handballer sind das gewohnt die spieler kommen ja wenn sie nicht wie hamburgs pascal hens schwer verletzt sind topfit zur ck hatten eine top vorbereitung h chstens im kopf k nnte da nach dem riesending olympia eine leere entstehen die dann auf die leistung in der bundesliga einfluss hat wenn man auf einmal nicht mehr vor 10 000 zuschauern spielt
6745699 warum sollte ich man muss mit den bedingungen so leben das war im handball schon immer so und ob ich jetzt alle spieler zusammen habe oder nur einige wichtig ist dass der start gelingt was bringt es mir wenn ich alle spieler da habe und trotzdem die ersten spiele verliere
6745700 den meisten geht es ja genauso das gleicht sich dann aus kiel k nnte vielleicht einen kleinen vorteil haben weil nur nikola karabatic fehlte
6745701 der ist aber torwart f r den ist es egal wo er sich spielpraxis holt da wird olympia sogar vielleicht ein vorteil sein weil das niveau so hoch ist ich denke kiel k nnte gegen ber klubs wie hamburg oder den rhein neckar l wen schon einen kleinen bonus haben aber das werden wir dann sehen wenn es wirklich losgeht

6745709 a girl can be married at 12 and divorced at 18 with children to support
6745710 the way you change a car is the way you change a wife in kano you give birth to a few children and you can find yourself divorced for the slightest excuse
6745711 the north is a very traditional place to make inroads you must work with traditional religious leaders
6745712 what we dont have yet is many traditional leaders coming out to promote condoms a number of them have come to terms with the fact that people are having sex and were thankful that weve had some kind of silent support which hasnt opposed the intervention
6745713 i dont jump to conclusions only god will judge who goes to hell or heaven
6745714 islamic laws are rigid no matter the situation there can be no sexual intercourse unless you are married rather than using condoms the only solution to sexual urges is to marry young
6745715 the most precious gift we can offer others is our presence

6745720 i refuse to join an army so as not to support the occupation and other acts that go against my most basic principles human rights democracy and every mans social responsibility towards his fellow man
6745721 deliberate attempt on the armys part to prevent our voices from being heard we were surprised by how quickly udi was arrested but we were prepared for such a scenario and knew that this was a price we were willing to pay
6745722 if more and more people voice their objection to the occupation the governments policy will have to follow suit
6745723 they are only having sex when i die if they dont date boys at all and just want to be infatuated with their father that is what i am really going for

6745745 he ratan tata has invested a lot in this project it is not his intention to pull out until he is forced to do so by the circumstances he has said earlier that it is the people of west bengal who have to take the call
6745746 we are deeply concerned about the people of bengal its for the people of bengal to decide whether we are going to be an unwanted citizen or a resposible corporate if it is the latter then we will be happy if not then we would have to just pursue our plans regardless
6745747 if people say that that we will protect our investments irrepsective of anything then they are wrong i will not bring in my employees to singur if there is threat of them being beaten up tata will do whatever necessary to protect its employees

6745791 to be realizing that goal and certainly under the various circumstances that weve dealt with throughout this tournament it feels phenomenal
6745792 weve seen not getting out of the pool to getting out of our pool barely getting past the quarters and losing in the bronze medal match now going to the gold medal match so we have quite the array of experience on this team
6745793 it was just two teams giving everything they had and luckily enough we pulled it out in the end
6745794 it easily could have went either way that fifth set was amazing because it was just so back and forth back and forth nobody really got a big lead at all and we have confidence that we have the players that can make some key plays at the end and thats kind of what happened

6745814 these scientists had found themselves saying that science was just one way of understanding how the world was created
6745815 speaking as a rationalist who holds things to be true of false based on the evidence and not on superstitious mumbo jumbo or wish fulfillment fantasy the evidence points to the earth being billions of years old and that species have evolved hy natural selection and if you reply that science like religion is just one of a number of equally valid ways of knowing the world id reply that science is the only one thats brought us antibiotics anesthetic dentistry airlines power stations copmuters and all the good thing we take for granted in the modern world and whats religion brought us hatred genocide ethnic cleansing bigotry intolerance and wilful stupidity

6745839 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
6745840 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
6745841 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
6745842 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
6745843 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
6745844 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
6745845 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american

6745856 if obama can keep the vote close in dallas county thats a win
6745857 its a county the republicans are used to racking up a big margin in but i think this year could be different when its all said and done i think both parties will look at dallas county as the place where it was decided
6745858 theyre worried about their farmland being gobbled up by developers
6745859 you have one of the fastest growing areas in the midwest and you have towns that are about as rural as you can get all in the space of about 25 miles and there are big differences in their issues they care about
6745860 i think everyones thoughts are focused on the economy and the housing market
6745861 people are concerned about the changes to their lifestyle gas prices and providing for their families
6745862 maybe they wouldnt turn out but i think all iowans understand how important their role in this election is and will weigh their vote very seriously
6745863 ive heard people say how much the vice president pick will affect their vote but i dont see that happening
6745864 with the economy and with foreign policy people want someone they feel confident in
6745865 i dont think anyone is using race as a factor
6745866 i think iowa is a very open state in that regard i mean hes already won here
6745867 if you look there are a lot of registered independents
6745868 i think obama is the type of candidate that will appeal to moderate republicans and independents so he should do well
6745869 i think a lot of voters who register as independents are actually more conservative than the ones who register as republicans
6745870 i think even those who register as independents still lean to the right
6745871 i think the thing you see in dallas county is that the more conservative branch of the republican is in control and has been for quite a while
6745872 were no plans to cut the levels of permanent workers
6745873 this is tragic news for those workers and their families who are to lose their jobs
6745874 unfortunately it is a sign of the economic times and i know from discussions with ford that they have been reluctant to lose well trained and valuable staff
6745875 in response to softening market conditions affecting the industry ford will reduce production volumes at some of its european plants during the remainder of 2008
6745876 reductions are likely to apply to both car and commercial vehicle plants
6745877 there are no plans to reduce the levels of permanent employment as the result of this reduction in production volumes but temporary employees are being advised that their contracts will not be renewed beyond the expiry date of their current contracts in early october

6745907 spending behind the united states presidential election and around the beijing olympic games should continue to boost 2008 revenues
6745908 levels of activity in 2008 should match those seen in 2007 and there are significant new business opportunities
6745909 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6745910 in addition the new united states president will have to wrestle with twin fiscal and budget deficits in early 2009 and post the olympics chinese growth may slow due to inflationary particularly food price concerns and the impact that a weakening united states economy has on the rest of the world

6745918 el nombre de la pel cula representa una dualidad sobre esos terribles episodios y la devoci n a la virgen mar a algo que oscila entre la fe y la esperanza y el temor de ser secuestrado ambas cosas muy presentes en el contexto colombiano
6745919 intentamos hacer una pel cula seria y honesta alejada del estereotipo estoy seguro de que los cuadros son reales no solo por las investigaciones que se hicieron sino porque gente involucrada en el conflicto estuvo durante los rodajes
6745920 el principal aporte de la pel cula es brindar una voz aterrizada no cegada por la venganza o la ira vuelve a lo m s esencial de un conflicto el elemento humano es una voz conciliadora que no entra a la discusi n pol tica sino que demuestra que all afuera hay un mont n de personas sufriendo por el secuestro las minas o los combates

6745953 we looked at several agencies throughout the united states but kept coming back to team detroit their creative work and overall wealth of experience in the industry shined through
6745954 as a southeast michigan agency we were psyched to find a client who recognized the talent in their own backyard
6745955 more often than not i t creative is fairly bland but compuware came to us with an inspiring platform that we could dig into we think this is a partnership and a strategic platform that can easily lead to great work

6745962 intel is overwhelmingly ahead of its rivals in the area of internet access devices and employs the x86 architecture for which it has development tools and abundant assets
6745963 one of the challenges for businesses moving data around is the lack of security of mobile devices notably removable storage devices such as usb memory sticks
6745964 a recent paper from enisa published in june 2008 stated that usb devices present considerable risk as they usually lack security controls and are rarely covered by corporate security policies with such gadgets being widely used in business today companies need to be able to protect and account for the data stored on them as they can easily be lost or left behind
6745965 today many organisations are still struggling to get a handle on their own data security practices but as this example has again highlighted they need to rise to the challenges relating to the sharing of information with third parties and understand their responsibilities resulting from such practices
6745966 it seems that a number of businesses are still catching up with their security procedures in order to bring themselves in line with data protection legislation
6745967 this latest loss of information illustrates again that these issues need to be addressed sooner rather than later in order to avoid any further embarrassments and to protect those people whose details may be at risk

6746005 we delivered a very respectable second quarter performance despite the impacts of significant macroeconomic softness and a deteriorating consumer environment both of which continue to weigh on the retail sector our relentless focus on inventory management and expense control along with our share repurchase program enabled us to deliver earnings per share that exceeded year ago
6746006 our focus in this difficult environment continues to be on managing the business prudently and investing in strengthening our brands to position the company for success when the economy improves we are highly focused on evolving and modernizing the ann taylor brand maximizing the potential of loft and growing our factory and internet channels in terms of our outlook for the balance of the year we expect conditions to remain challenging to mitigate the anticipated softness in consumer spending which is likely to continue to pressure our top line we have planned our business accordingly concentrating on managing our expenses and inventories thus despite these challenges we are reiterating our previous guidance of diluted earnings per share for the year to be in the range of 1 80 1 90

6746252 mr gadd gary glitters real name is pleased to be back in this country
6746253 the last few days as you know he has been travelling around asia and that time was not wasted
6746254 it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival
6746255 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into place a proper procedure for his protection and his well being
6746256 mr gadd is pleased to be back for another reason he is pleased to be back because for the first time he can appear before a court of justice
6746257 he tells me that his trial in vietnam a country which has been condemned by virtually every organisation concerned with justice and human rights as being a system of unfair justice and political trials was a charade was a travesty of justice
6746258 he never got a fair trial and in due course that will be expanded upon
6746259 this morning was an opportunity for him to come before english justice for the first time to make these points
6746260 unfortunately the court didnt agree with my submission that it should hear me on the issue about the unfairness of how he has been treated by the vietnamese system
6746261 that was an opportunity that i sought to take on his behalf but the court decided it did not want to hear
6746262 therefore this morning there has been no opportunity before an impartial tribunal to put forward why it was he was innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted in vietnam
6746263 there may be another opportunity in the future its too early to tell
6746264 mr gadd wants through me to say to you that he did not commit the offences for which he was convicted in vietnam
6746265 it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his defence forward
6746266 ultimately he wants that to be tested if he can before the courts of this country
6746267 that was the reason for this morning when i opposed the making of a notification order
6746268 i sought an interim order to give me an opportunity to develop what im saying to you but that was not given to me
6746269 one of the reasons scotland didnt take to lady thatcher was because of that
6746270 we didnt mind the economic side so much but we didnt like the social side at all
6746271 im well on the record as never having approved of either margaret thatchers social or economic policies thats clear if you look at the interview
6746272 i was commenting on why scots in particular were so deeply resentful of margaret thatcher and i strongly believe that her social message of no such thing as society and the poll tax cut against the grain of scotlands social conscience
6746273 that doesnt mean that the nation liked her economic policies just that we liked her social policies even less
6746274 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6746275 youre just going to have to hear from the campaign and theyll make the announcement when theyre ready

6746350 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker

6746368 i cant wait to get to the ravens stadium i cant wait to see some of the games this year

6746394 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6746395 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6746396 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6746397 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6746398 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6746399 what it does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health

6746404 i thought marilyn monroe was beautiful but id kill myself if i ever got that fat
6746405 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6746406 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6746407 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6746408 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6746409 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6746410 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6746411 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6746412 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6746413 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6746414 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6746415 if you trust every web site but not a government
6746416 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6746417 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6746418 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6746419 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6746420 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6746421 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6746422 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6746423 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6746424 there are many indications to suggest that more attacks are planned pakistan could face a lot of bloodshed as it tries to deal with a very difficult problem
6746425 technically by aug 19 the judges should have been reinstated
6746426 should be debated on monday and tuesday and on wednesday this resolution should be passed and the judges should be reinstated

6746435 this negative campaign ad is clearly express sic advocacy and under a federal law passed in 2003 the bi partisan campaign reform act known colloquially as mccain feingold it cannot legally be paid for with corporate money including those of a non profit
6746436 the ad indisputably concerns an election takes a position on the character and fitness for office of a candidate and raises no legislative issue even this highly skeptical supreme court would turn up its noses at the foul odor emitted by this clear abuse of federal election law

6746442 it is certainly gratifying to realize what a high standing we have in the eyes of other engineering educators so much of virginia techs fine reputation comes from the extraordinary talent of our undergraduate students it is an annually renewed success story made possible by the bright students that choose the virginia tech college of engineering for their studies and the wonderful education that they receive from our dedicated and innovative faculty members
6746443 the college continues to work towards enhancing the high quality of its programs developing the leadership and technology skills and ethical values of its students and preparing them for global business challenges we are strengthening our curriculum to give students an even better education than before
6746444 we believe that this academic minor which may be the first such at any university offers a good way for our undergraduates to learn more about diversity and multicultural issues in the workplace and their impact on individual effectiveness and corporate competitiveness

6746509 our states proud history of union justice confidence is undermined when our public leaders strip our families of basic protections we should all enjoy there is nothing pro family about rolling back protections for some families
6746510 allowing louisianas anti discrimination order to expire would mean the end of any legal protection for gay citizens in the state

6746557 high energy prices have led to an increase in biodiesel production which in turn has led to an increase in the amount of crude glycerol in the market
6746558 we have shown that it is possible to use the crude glycerol byproduct from the biodiesel industry as a carbon source for microalgae that produce omega 3 fatty acids
6746559 after thorough chemical analysis we have also shown that the algae biomass composition has the same quality as the commercial algae product
6746560 the fish fed the algae had significant amounts of omega 3 fatty acids

6746565 buyplexus com is unique because it benefits both the shopper and business owner
6746566 shoppers have a place to find the products or services theyre interested in and merchants can utilize the sites marketing tools to generate additional exposure in the search engines and social media networks weve created a powerful shopping portal in buyplexus com thats capable of rivaling some of the most popular online
6746567 the free business directory promotion is designed to allow more users to experience the benefits of the network and build a significant advertiser base weve had a great response so far
6746568 since buyplexus com was built with the new web 2 0 marketing standards in mind we were able to augment the listings with additional components like business blogs rss feeds google maps photo galleries reviews comments and social media functionality
6746569 our designers and developers knew savvy marketers would appreciate these extra features and they did a great job integrating them into the site
6746570 the goal with buyplexus is to enable anyone to post and search products and services not just business owners
6746571 many competitors simply dont allow people to take advantage of a networks popularity without paying high fees or having an established business so we made sure buyplexus was accessible to everyone and didnt exclude those users
6746572 we hope the launch of buyplexus com shows our continued commitment to being a resource for everyone not just our clients
6746573 in terms of advertising a business we know the best approach to marketing is a comprehensive one so buyplexus certainly meets that need by providing so many options

6746708 vores forventninger til annonceindt gterne for net og papir er u ndret at vi vil tjene lige meget p de to ting senest ved udgangen af 2009 derefter vil online overstige print hvor meget vi forventer at tjene er en forretningshemmelighed
6746709 vi oplyser ikke detaljer om opsplitning af vores annoncesalg i print og online jeg tror balancen mellem print og web tipper i 2010 til fordel for webben det er et kompliceret sp rgsm l idet berlingske har valgt en vertikalstrategi der f eks betyder at al sport i sommer blev trukket ud af berlingske dk og lagt over p sporten dk det bliver n ppe det sidste vertikalinitiativ derfor skal man for berlingskes vedkommende tage en helhedsbetragtning p vores forskellige sites
6746710 det g r hurtigt men der g r nogle r en mere pr cis prognose savner mening fordi der ingen erfaring er for hvordan de generelle konjunkturer p virker v ksten p et nyt marked hvor det ellers er nemt at lave positive fremskrivninger
6746711 inden for tre r vil jyllands postens samlede overskud for netaktiviteterne v re st rre end for papiravisen
6746712 udviklingen g r fra print til online og det kan ske p eb dk i 2010 det er et popul rt site med mange eksponeringer politiken dk er ogs sandsynlig i 2010 da de er dem med den mindst annonceoms tning p avisen og derfor hurtigere kan n det
6746713 hos gratisaviserne kommer det aldrig til at ske ellers skal de i hvert fald g re noget drastisk selvom avisen dk har freeway i ryggen har vi ikke set meget til det endnu metroxpress og urban har heller ikke de mest velfungerende sites men det er heller ikke der de skal fokusere deres indsats de skal f en sund forretning ud af deres trafikaviser
6746714 pengene f lger effekten hvis der ikke er nok bes gende eller hvis det er de forkerte set med kommercielle jne har annonc rerne ingen gavn af det den del af det er det prim rt ekstra bladet der er lykkes med

6746971 we need to take a look at the strategic picture now and we need nato the european union to discuss the fact that many assumptions we have made may have changed and we need to take a hard look at this new reality

6746973 you have such bad taste how did you get so lucky with me
6746974 able to independently discern the name maya kassandra soetoro from artifacts left behind in the process of forging a new fake document for barack from an image of mayas original document
6746975 take responsibility to verify the eligibility of mr barack h obama to be president of the united states
6746976 mr obama has refused to produce a physical certified stamped copy of his birth certificate an electronically displayed imaged displayed by his official campaign website has alleged to have been a forgery we request that the fec require mr obama to authorize the fec to obtain an official copy of his birth certificate
6746977 i am looking for 50 brave men or women from 49 states and the district of columbia to join me in suing the secretaries of state in our respective states to prevent them from posting the name barak h obama on the november 2008 ballot until he presents incontrovertible proof that he is a u s citizen
6746978 the secretaries of state are the ones who by placing a person or initiative on the ballot certify that the candidates or initiatives meet the legal requirements to be on the ballot
6746979 the office of the president is simply too important to trust to someone other than a person whose loyalties are 100 percent american and while it is impossible to read into the heart of a man or woman we do have the test our forefathers gave us which is this office is not to be entrusted to anyone but a natural u s citizen
6746980 the revelation that the birth certificate of obamas own sister was evidently used to create the electronic forgery represents what supporters of this analysis claim is a smoking gun that appears to implicate sen obama directly hawaii law limits access to vital records to family members only a fact which slowed down the ability of researchers to compare the purported obama birth certificate which displayed from the start a peculiar provenance and inexplicable features to genuine specimens therefore it would seem that either maya k soetoro ng as she is now called supplied the document or its image to half brother barack or his campaign or obama his campaign used it without her permission
6746981 the stakes couldnt be higher even the snopes anti rumor site acknowledges that obamas constitutional fitness to be president depends solely on his being born in the united states because his mother not yet 19 at the time of his birth would not have had a sufficient number of years as an adult citizen according to the laws prevailing at the time to pass on natural born citizenship automatically
6746982 there have been reports so far unconfirmed that obama was born outside the country either in kenya his presumed fathers native land or in canada the fact that the obama campaign has been touting as genuine a forgery since june 12 will likely increase pressure to not only account for the fake but produce a genuine paper birth certificate obama in his book dreams from my father specifically mentioned having such a document in his possession but it has not been submitted for public inspection or analysis if it in fact exists
6746983 if obama were born outside the united states one could argue that he would not meet the legal definition of natural born citizen because u
6746984 so she wouldnt have met the requirement of five years after the age of 16
6746985 natural born citizen under article ii section 1 of the constitution of the united states
6746986 no person except a natural born citizen shall be eligible to the office of president
6746987 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
6746988 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
6746989 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
6746990 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
6746991 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
6746992 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6746993 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6746994 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6746995 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6746996 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw

6747039 the department of defense reports show that nearly 90 percent of rape victims in the army are junior ranking women whose average age is 21 while most of the assailants are non commissioned officers or junior men whose average age is 28
6747040 even with a force that is now 14 percent female and with rules that prohibit drill instructors from using racial epithets and curses those same instructors still routinely denigrate recruits by calling them
6747041 two studies of army and marine recruits one conducted in 1996 by psychologists l n rosen and l martin and the other in 2005 by jessica wolfe and her colleagues of the boston veterans affairs health center both of which were published in the journal military medicine found that half the male enlistees had been physically abused in childhood one sixth had been sexually abused and 11 percent had experienced both this is significant because as psychologists have long known childhood abuse often turns men into abusers

6747120 this economy has its own attractions even under the worst conditions
6747121 it will be troublesome if europe imposes unilateral sanctions on irans banks but we will be able to again replace the outgoing banks
6747122 domestic investment on its own cannot meet the countrys needs which makes iran an opportunity for foreign banks particularly as investment banks not retail banks to function as gates in attracting foreign investment
6747123 this kind of case is supposed to be in a military court
6747124 mr charest was separated from the events in montreal north last week quebec needs to speak with one voice there needs to be independent oversight of police reviews we need to make the people of montreal north sovereign again
6747125 we have been forced to keep these children all their relatives have declined to take them although they are now in good health condition and can enjoy life like other kids
6747126 stigma associated with hiv aids is very very strong here it is without any doubt responsible for the plight facing these children
6747127 the vct voluntary hiv counselling and testing centre in the district remains idle because the local community believe they cannot contract the disease
6747128 we need an aggressive awareness campaign in these remote areas
6747129 this region is vast to reach a majority of the youths who are in the remote parts of our region we need support
6747130 as you can see we have no picture or poster of a condom here we cannot take the risk the landlord cannot allow us to do that
6747131 it is impossible for me to talk to an elderly woman about hiv aids my culture does not allow me to advise or discuss any sexual matter with a woman who is older than me
6747132 foi desenvolvida uma cultura de bebedeira clandestina e perigosa que se d freq entemente fora do campus

6747138 dominating like we are its no surprise i know its been crazy because weve been on the podium a lot
6747139 desire for change on earmarks and our commitment to get it done
6747140 funding will send your tax dollars back to be used in your neighborhood where it belongs
6747141 not every earmark is bad but my goodness they ought to pass the straight face test
6747142 its hard to really think that nadal is going to have any kind of bumps
6747143 hes had a longer season this year than hes ever had yet he seems completely energized
6747144 you have to battle not only with the curbs but also with the walls and guardrails
6747145 so you have to be really precise and careful you have to have a good feeling on the car you have to be confident
6747146 when you drive on a street circuit it is always a problem with safety because you dont have runoff areas on the other hand monaco is quite a low speed street circuit but anything can happen anytime
6747147 designing a track for a green field is one thing doing a track in the city is something else
6747148 you cannot go through peoples gardens you cannot knock down peoples houses
6747149 if you have a corner that is too fast and has no safety runoff area then you have to think about how to make it slower
6747150 it was difficult to make the joint between the road and the bridge as smooth as is necessary for a formula one car they can only function on a very smooth surface so the bump cannot be very big
6747151 yawning man was the greatest band ive ever seen we saw them many times at their generator parties we had been trying to get into the punk scene that didnt even exist anymore we were into black flag minor threat misfits but when we finally tapped into the local scene its yawning man and theyre playing this really stone y music it wasnt militant like black flag it was very drugged very mystical but we got into it
6747152 youd get to the location be up there partying and then the lallis would show up in their van all mellow drag out their shit and set up it was more like something in the 60s than some gnarly punk scene everyones just tripping and theyre just playing away for hours
6747153 school was fine sure i got bored there like everyone does but i didnt have any terrible experiences like some people do
6747154 one of the funniest guys ive ever known he was a tall guy and he had red hair so he stood out and he kinda had to live up to that clever dude great musician had his shit together
6747155 i was a normal kid in high school smoking pot behind the bleachers doing that type of shit we all played football we werent jocks
6747156 we just wanted to get in there and fuck people up
6747157 but i didnt realise that until later i got into music because i loved it and it was like chasing shit in your head and everyone else in our scene was the same way once it was like lets be different it became well how can we be different really you hear your favourite song and you say that makes me feel so good now what if no one else played it so i had to in the desert it was about having to make your own thing and being isolated enough to do it without anyone fucking with you
6747158 we were literally in like eighth and ninth grade and josh was in seventh or something
6747159 nick played guitar and when john left after a rehearsal one day he sang he sang better than john but we didnt have the balls to kick him out but we did have the balls to keep nick in
6747160 punk rock kicked me in the balls ive never been into metal ive never felt a part of it i always get dragged in we want you to be in the metal scene and im always like i dont wanna be in the metal scene
6747161 nick was the guy wearing vans jeans ozzy shirt flannel hair down to the middle of his back smokin cigarettes doin blow just partying hes been going like that since the early 80s hes a radical josh and nick couldnt have been more opposite really but equally interesting growing up nick was definitely the free spirit he came from the tough side of the tracks and we were all buddies and he was always just a couple of steps ahead of us i mean nick he just cant be stopped

6747163 try and get the word out to the public about whats happening to america and give them an opportunity to try to change things
6747164 by supporting this initiative we are providing entrepreneurs with tools and training they need to become successful leaders in our business communities
6747165 youre going to have those questions no matter what given our climate now
6747166 hail mary full of grace thomas with thee blessed art thou among clarabel
6747167 tough on seagulls and tough on the causes of seagulls
6747168 seagulls are a menace to scottish towns and cities they thrive on litter and their aggressive behaviour towards other birds pets and even people is increasingly problematic
6747169 dumfries has a particular problem with gulls with regular reports of dive bombing and litter strewn around the town after a seagull has raided a bin
6747170 i even read this week about a young paperboy who has had to abandon his deliveries due to constant attacks from the birds
6747171 they are now stealing food from peoples hands and harassing locals and visitors its only a matter of time before a gull collides with someone and there is a serious injury
6747172 we have seen a massive proliferation in fast food outlets and that leads to discarded food
6747173 sir excuse me i think you have forgot to unzip your pants
6747174 were pleased to be among the quality solution providers that played an important role in making this project a success
6747175 enabling healthcare institutions and physicians across ontario to share patient information through a secure and reliable network is vitally important to patient care and comview was the right choice for hydro one telecoms remote network equipment management
6747176 with the increased demand for broadband services we recognize the need to provide reliable power for voice video and data services delivered by fiber to the home networks
6747177 we manufacture back up powering systems that keep communications networks alive
6747178 through three decades of experience supporting broadband cable systems we have built a large base of powering knowledge this has allowed us to support new broadband and fiber to the home deployments as they expand around the world
6747179 im happy about it but this is just a part of the goal the next goal is to repeat this and so just keep up the concentration all the time
6747180 first of all i dont think lewis needs any help
6747181 he has shown himself that he can do the job and that he doesnt need anyone the second point is that i am trying to do the maximum for myself and i am not helping any other drivers
6747182 in the past it has been very clear that at mclaren they have had the policy of equal drivers and both have the same opportunities
6747183 i have the same car the same opportunity and i am just working towards improving the pace and the results
6747184 the biggest victory in sport is the athletes standing on the podium and to give them the support they need which has been missing in the past it takes resources
6747185 in britain we have a habit of succeeding at sport or in huge events and then dipping after them or being complacent and that cannot happen here we cannot do anything that will jeopardise the next four eight or 12 years because we have an opportunity to create something that is world class so that when the rebecca adlingtons of this world are retiring as multiple olympic champions their successors are already in the world class environment to deliver sustained success
6747186 its been made very clear to us to budget on that money being in place and we will continue to do that until we hear any different
6747187 we know what we have been told what to budget and we will do that but where the money comes from is not directly our responsibility we will support the government in any schemes they try to do but from our point of view we really need some certainty moving forward
6747188 we want to see evidence of development and success and wouldnt make any exceptions across the board it is the national governing bodys uk athletics job to ensure that they have the world class performance directors and coaches in place to take the sport forward
6747189 athletics would themselves agree that they have not delivered in the way that our most successful sports have and internally they know they have a long way to go
6747190 they know they have to create a better environment for athletes and better level of influence and support for personal coaches
6747191 you have to be prepared to make some very tough decisions about which athletes you fund we want to focus on athletes with potential for 2012 not 2009 10 so it could be a smaller team in london
6747192 it is the national governing bodys job to ensure that they have the world class poerformance directors and coaches in place to take the sport forward and while we are there to support them it is their decision
6747193 but we invest in the sport and we would expect that investment to be well used and we would expect to understand why they are making certain decisions but in the end we are not there to run the sport
6747194 accomplished quietly but passionately and never for personal gain hallmarks of what bankers cup recognition is all about
6747195 roy toys and played his signature songs of course he performed his big hit
6747196 dang me you cant roller skate in a buffalo herd
6747197 john do you think you can have this done by friday
6747198 do you think you can have this done by friday john
6747199 and i was right it was the hardest job i could find
6747200 i worked all night and on the weekends and had all the tombstones ads that appear in financial publications following a deal to prove it
6747201 i was having a really macho career i was in the right place and now i sort of feel like i have other fish to fry
6747202 opt out patterns across careers career paths of nearly 1 000 women who graduated from harvard between 1988 and 1991 using a rich set of biographical data culled from 10th and 15th anniversary reunion surveys
6747203 there are plenty of women out there who have made it work but they all have their own individual stories whether its a nanny a or working it out with an individual manager who happens to have gone through the same thing
6747204 its all very one off the infrastructure is not there in the business world and thats what has yet to rise up in these industries
6747205 i was really pretty surprised by the number of women i had seen drop out
6747206 i had gone through my own debate about whether working was the right thing for me
6747207 i think the big shift for me was i went from saying bring it on and give me the hardest thing you can find to oh no i actually need to compartmentalize my work into a certain number of hours per day
6747208 when you get out of business school with a business degree youre not a business person youre a manager not everybody knows what a manager means but everyone knows what a doctor and lawyer means
6747209 the passion and connection you feel in your pursuit of a career may be very different for doctors and lawyers than people in business
6747210 and since many school marry those men they end up being stay at home wives regardless of their own vision of what they wanted from their careers
6747211 besides the noble art of getting things done there is the noble art of leaving things undone the wisdom of life consists in the elimination of non essentials
6747212 we had nine units on scene and winter haven fire department had two
6747213 we used to own the property in that area and sold some of the property when i was a kid

6747216 daca tot m am lasat de fumat mai pot trage o tigara
6747217 prima oara stateam de vorba cu vlad petri intr o noapte de revelion si ne gandeam cum sa facem un colaj de cinci filmulete despre un barbat si o femeie intr o camera
6747218 mai tarziu dupa ce am vorbit cu multa lume am ajuns la opt filme din care am ramas cu sapte iar tema a trecut la o desfasurare cronologica a evenimentelor pe durata unei zile precum si la mai multe povesti care se intersecteaza
6747219 ciprian alexandrescu a adus echipament de la videolink mavrodineanu a venit cu sunetul iar ceilalti au facut asistenta de regie
6747220 ne trebuia catering la filmare asa ca am facut rost de numarul de telefon al baiatului patronului de la springtime si i am spus ca avem nevoie de 20 de saorme promitandu i ca l punem pe generic da dar as vrea un banner mi a zis care sa fie pus acolo unde se va da filmul bine si daca merg la berlin n au unde pune banner acolo pana la urma ne am inteles
6747221 you need chaos in your soul to give birth to a dancing star
6747222 my goal is to make people feel like theyre a part of the harvest process by constantly tweeting about what were doing
6747223 the harvest is the most fun and exciting time for a winemaker using twitter is a perfect way to bring people in on the action the next best thing to a wine focused reality show
6747224 we want our winery to mirror the social media aspects of twitter creating sharing and communicating ideas with people the more we share about our winemaking practices the more knowledge we stand to gain
6747225 you need chaos in your soul to give birth to a dancing star
6747226 you need chaos in your soul to give birth to a dancing star

6747231 you need chaos in your soul to give birth to a dancing star
6747232 barack obamas failure to accurately report his campaigns financial records is an incredibly suspicious situation that appears to be an attempt to hide his campaigns interaction with a left wing organization previously convicted of voter fraud for a candidate who claims to be practicing new politics his fec reports look an awful lot like the old style chicago politics of yesterday
6747233 the rnc can concoct all of the outlandish conspiracy theories they want but when we saw that our fec report didnt accurately reflect the field work csi was hired to perform we corrected it its pretty bold for the rnc to attack us for a clerical error after john mccains campaign was just forced to return 50 000 raised by a foreign national through a number of contributors who werent even supporting mccain
6747234 its rare that people dont file any amended reports if he has a pattern of lots and lots of amended reports that would be more noteworthy than an occasional one
6747235 all of this just seems like an awful lot of money and time spent on political campaigning for an organization that purports to exist to help low income consumers
6747236 acorn has a long and sordid history of employing convoluted enron style accounting to illegally use taxpayer funds for their own political gain
6747237 now it looks like acorn is using the same type of convoluted accounting scheme for obamas political gain
6747238 that was a very short term contract for one week of work in ohio they asked us to do canvasses in five cities statewide
6747239 assist persons and organizations who advance the interests of low and moderate income people
6747240 i do not know the day to day work of what they do im on the board
6747241 not for profit political and campaign management firm much like any political consulting firm
6747242 we have a wide range of clients we provide political campaign management we provide field services
6747243 our clients are typically considered liberal our clients are labor unions liberal to progressive candidates nonprofit organizations on the liberal side of the political spectrum
6747244 we are organized specifically not to make money but we make money there are no profits we have a staff of 60 people around the country and that eats up our entire profit were not a for profit corporation but we are not a group like a united way
6747245 acorn has a lot of different partner organizations we are a partner but we are separate
6747246 off my case metal man as this is a scifi story is he a robot and has the civil rights movement extended to include the robots right to marriage and what did the conservatives say to that or is a utopian story and theres no conservatives left its not my fault youve worn me out again
6747247 im just saying why make a big thing of it why tell anybody never mind your pr people
6747248 dammit see there you go you say something like that and i just melt how can i argue with that
6747249 a wedding should be how and what both parties want and not what your pr people suggest it should be and anyway you possessive fucker i wont be yours ever marriage or not
6747250 thats ridiculous anyone as charming and uh gifted uh gifted is she gifted or not as you must have loads of friends
6747251 youre the only one who thinks im charming and thieves arent well liked in c block its hard enough getting stuff without worrying about somebody snatching it out from under you we all pretty much kept to ourselves
6747252 its okay mitch you can say it mute since when is being mute a gift i wouldnt say that not being able to speak is a gift just as i wouldnt say that my not being able to sing is a gift and if shes not able to speak how could she have this conversation this really doesnt make any sense no shes not but shes one of those people on the fringe if a mute got hurt you could go to her and shed fix you up and she wouldnt tell the government about you what are mutes somehow illegal in this society theres a whole bunch of underground doctors and clinics shes the best one but i wouldnt say shes a friend exactly like i said more an ally than a pal
6747253 now im one of those annoying women whose entire life revolves around her boyfriend
6747254 the move will be at great cost to tata motors and to shareholders but there is a concern about our people a definite concern about not being wanted
6747255 whether we will be a wanted or an unwanted resident or a good corporate citizen
6747256 we do have a plant outside of shanghai we do have a plant in chennai india we have a plant in monterrey mexico but the headquarters and the brains and everything needs to stay here in chicago and i dont just mean headquarters i mean people that produce
6747257 its about technology its about people and its also about proximity to our customers american manufacturing aint over theres a lot still going on we have a lot of customers within a few hours of here and this is the right location to service them
6747258 we have so much strength here its a logical place to build how do we do it in the ravenswood corridor when so few companies can do it we do it out of some deep spirit thats been here since the founding
6747259 we had somebody lifting some scrap copper out of here a few weeks ago and he didnt get many nights putting copper into his truck to go to a scrapyard before our people tackled him and got that guy out of here who was a crooked guy because people here are not gonna tolerate that they know that their livings and welfares have come out of this plant
6747260 this is important for us they made a strong statement on behalf of the quality of work force that they see not only in chicago but in the metropolitan area
6747261 this company was started right here in the city of chicago with a person who had a dream and expanded that dream to what it is today
6747262 you need chaos in your soul to give birth to a dancing star
6747263 it will be a very big production visceral and intellectual

6747267 unlike conventional war is the more successful you are in the short term the more troops you require the more ground and the more people you become responsible for the more troops you need there is no point thinking that aviation is going to make a strategic difference
6747268 youve worked so hard to get where you are are you going to quit now
6747269 apparently they refused her at first but she sent a follow up email which they never forwarded to us that they assured us was very nasty and hysterical but never got more detailed that that
6747270 there is no reason to give this anything not even the initial thing
6747271 let me make it perfectly clear for the record that im not at all pissed at nyra for their decision
6747272 they made the decision that they feel is in the best interest of the organization that is their right and i applaud them for it
6747273 the only legitimate source for this information under 21 casualties in iraq
6747274 as for galen his help with the list is greatly appreciated but this is nyras list and it was mine and another board member s call we had this list long before galen started updating it
6747275 if stefan or alex is going to be a coward in general then that is their business but in this case they were being cowards on nyras behalf which basically made it so that it was nyras cowardly decision to roll over and piss all over itself because oh noes some random came along and yelled at us because we had something on our website she didnt like
6747276 even though none of the board seems to be on my side which astounds me to no end or at least no one has spoken up about it yet ill see to it that name gets put back up
6747277 im going to recommend that nyra just use an initial like spc
6747278 i must say nyra running away like that when she didnt even have a half legit claim was stupid you dont have to cover your if the only thing trying to with you is some dumbass truck driving chick
6747279 find somebody who is in their 40s doing work that is fun that is meaningful that is making an impact and ask them how they got there
6747280 it always seems to come back to music and mexican food
6747281 why then arent we the leaders of energy and medical conventions

6747291 there were no injuries and the cause is still under investigation

6747303 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
6747304 the lack of resources and their quality on the ground the repeated aogs grounded planes in the fleet the scarcity of crews and the system of movement of crew members mean that the general feeling is one of operational chaos that places the passengers at risk
6747305 this is the final nail in spanairs coffin and may take down sas as well it is very hard to survive the reputational damage from a crash like this and most airlines dont
6747306 the question of viability is not really up for discussion at the moment

6747312 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6747313 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6747314 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6747315 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6747316 the price is right and family feud are regarded as heavyweight game show brands across europe australia and asia and this partnership offers tremendous opportunities for both glu and fme our development and marketing expertise in dealing with high value brands like these means the mobile games will compliment the brands perfectly with massive appeal to their target audience
6747317 each territory has a particular nuance but glu has the necessary expertise to fine tune the entertainment for each market in same way as the tv show has done for many years
6747318 its hugely embarrassing for the head of a banking group to be so lax with personal information that someone can steal his identity after all banks are constantly warning customers to guard their private details bank staff had to call andy on holiday to say they were freezing his accounts if it can happen to him it can happen to anyone

6747323 he told me if he wouldve gone anywhere else it wouldnt have fit his personality and knowing him were a lot alike williams said even though his older brother enjoyed his experience at arkansas he isnt trying to sway his brother
6747324 he doesnt try to get involved with my decision making
6747325 he told me that he saw so many people who made the wrong decision because of people telling them what to do
6747326 last year i played football and it turned out being successful
6747327 hes a deadly weapon at tight end because he can outrun linebackers hes an explosive player at the defensive end position he gambles at end but thats ok because he can recover
6747328 i like the atmosphere in barber shops you can go in and talk about anything
6747329 i think a lot of people are waiting to see how im going to perform the first couple of games to see if im legit
6747330 my motto is everyone that offers me a scholarship and a free education ill look at them
6747331 one day you think youre going to get cleared the next day you dont know
6747332 you have to have a strong mind to not worry about it
6747333 i want to be freshman of the year in the sec
6747334 ill say you know what you need to do when you get out there
6747335 we gave them a lot of time off the last few days to recover
6747336 i think our players learned how we prepare on thursday and what we expect of them the cutback in practice time shouldnt be construed as a lessening of the intensity
6747337 theres no walking around and relaxing on a thursday anymore
6747338 its come out and work and do things fast paced and get stuff done
6747339 i would say a lot has been asked of us not only mentally but physically
6747340 its getting closer to game week and weve got to be in top shape
6747341 at the same time weve got to work on execution and really performing out here on the practice field junior tackle ray dominguez said the opening two weeks of camp were a test in toughness
6747342 he wants to weed out all the weak ones right now it was a grind but most of all it was a mental grind to see how tough we are
6747343 we did today what we would do in a normal thursday practice
6747344 take about 20 minutes hit all phases of the special teams and then you work offense and defense and all situations of the game
6747345 i would say a lot has been asked out of us not only mentally but physically
6747346 he wants to weed out all the weak ones right now
6747347 not as much as we would like but he is progressing well
6747348 the goal is to come out there and get on top
6747349 then i went to grab it and there was nothing
6747350 its kind of the way its been happening to me this olympics
6747351 violated ncaa rules and what happened went over the coaches heads
6747352 hes got to learn how to do everything right but hes very very talented
6747353 he has a knack for understanding the blocking schemes and knowing how to rush the passer so i think youll see him play a lot this year and hopefully get some sacks for us
6747354 the coaches have fussed at me a lot but i think thats a good thing
6747355 it shows they believe i can play and they want me to be ready and i want to be ready too
6747356 i want to run through that a before the games i want to contribute to the team
6747357 hes having a good camp hes been getting a lot of reps and is learning about the speed of the game
6747358 he comes out here and tries to take advantage of the opportunity every day to get better
6747359 i dont think the coaches are afraid to put him out there i think the coaches know he can hold his own
6747360 like all true freshman theres a lot of growing for him to do and hes not nearly even close to being the player that we hope he can become but i love his work ethic
6747361 if he makes a mistake hes honest enough to say coach that was on me he doesnt hide or try to cop out from anything
6747362 ive been pleased with the way hes been trying to get in there and be tough
6747363 i love the fans i love being around people that talk like me walk like me and laugh like me
6747364 some guys are missing their passes coming back and missing them again weve still got our work cut out for ourselves we need to get crisper in the next three or four days
6747365 he throws the ball well catches well hes a great athlete
6747366 we didnt do any kicking we cut all that out were trying to get their legs back and we didnt push them hard we were in full pads and had a lot of good contact i thought it was one of our better practices in terms of keeping their attention
6747367 its been a good three weeks but its time to start getting into some kind of game shape and game mentality sunday when we come back well do a normal sunday just like were going to do throughout the season
6747368 today we practiced a little like it was a monday practice which means we started some primary preparations for our first game of the season against clemson
6747369 i think the biggest thing we are trying to get our players to learn to do is how to prepare for a game everybody on the team has a role for preparation for a game
6747370 we did a little bit more today than we usually do i think it was a good start i was pleased with the players intensity and attitude towards trying to learn you always make mistakes but that is why you practice
6747371 we kind of know who we are going to go out there and work with
6747372 in some cases we are working with more than one player at a certain position
6747373 we went full speed tempo but from there we were thud on contact
6747374 we did not tackle except for three kicking team plays so some of the stats are skewed
6747375 what was supposed to be a spontaneous approach to my favourite sport and its protagonists during the giro ditalia 2005 turned out to be one of my most challenging portrait series since then i have been travelling to many important races portraying the cyclists immediately after crossing the finishing line though they stand still the race in this moment seems to continue on their faces
6747376 esta resoluci n afecta a nuestra libertad de expresi n y fue dispuesta con argumentos antojadizos y falaces adem s existen cientos de radios que tienen repetidoras en el interior del pa s pero no recibieron una medida similar
6747377 por entender que se trata de una medida arbitraria que coarta la libertad de expresi n y no tiene precedentes

6747379 lo que dicen las c maras es que no hubo ninguna explosi n durante el despegue
6747380 ser n las cajas amarillas o negras como son conocidas las que lo diluciden
6747381 que se est n dando informaciones amarillas y malintencionadas sobre lo que es llanamente un accidente
6747382 se adoptaron todas las medidas de seguridad que se pudieron tomar
6747383 ya que no se puede olvidar que el piloto siempre es el primer interesado en la seguridad del veh culo que lidera puesto que va en primera fila del mismo
6747384 es el medio m s seguro que existe ya que los aviones sufren un examen cada d a y otro antes de cada vuelo aunque casos como ste sean m s espectaculares que los que se cobran las carreteras de nuestro pa s cada d a

6747389 naja du siehst ja ich liege im bett weil es besser ist wenn ich nicht herumlaufe und mich ausruhe
6747390 ja aber diesmal bin ich nicht gegen die wand oder auf den boden gefallen weil ich in dem moment als mir schwindelig wurde in der n he vom bett war und mich habe darauf fallen lassen die rzte haben sich sofort um mich gek mmert und mir ein serum gegeben so dass ich mich wieder erholte
6747391 aber ich werde widerstand leisten bis zum schluss und ich glaube ich kann noch weitere 30 oder 40 tage aushalten sie k nnen sich hier nicht erkl ren woher ich diese kraft nehme und bringen mir respekt entgegen weil sie gemerkt haben dass es kein scherz war als ich ihnen sagte dass ich bis zur letzten konsequenz gehen werde
6747392 pass gut dich auf lieber freund und vergiss nicht dass du schon alles getan hast was du tun musstest
6747393 ich bin entschlossen bis zum ende zu gehen und herauszukommen egal wie auch immer lebendig oder tot
6747394 irgendwann dachte ich dass ich hier nicht lebend herauskommen w rde und da ich nichts mehr zu verlieren hatte stellte ich den typ der mir verpr gelte entweder t test du mich oder ich dich sagte ich zu ihm und im falle du mich t test tust du mir einen gefallen denn umgekehrt bleibe ich weiter eingesperrt
6747395 ich f hlte mich von dem unternehmer ausgebeutet lernte die leute von der cnt anarcho syndikalistische gewerkschaft kennen und begann subverisve propaganda auf der strasse zu verteilen ich transportierte packweise flugbl tter auf dem motorrad und nahm an klandestinen versammlungen teil
6747396 wir haben in spanien keine demokratie zuerst gab es einen diktator franco und jetzt gibt es ein paar politische parteien die unternehmen funktionieren genauso weiter es wurden keine l sungen f r die vorrangigen bef rnisse gefunden es fehlt die gleichheit zwischen reichen und armen
6747397 es war so gut wie mein erstes delikt ich war sehr nerv s aber alles lief gut ein lokalpolizist zielte auf uns aber als er unsere waffen und maskierungen sah lief er davon
6747398 es war eine weise das zur ckzuerk mpfen was die banken uns nahmen ich bereue nichts ausser dass ich nicht genug genommen habe
6747399 wir verteilten uns und lebten gut ich organisierte alles und verwahrte auch die waffen
6747400 im zweiten stockwerk waren wir die politischen der linken und hier kontaktierte ich leute der cnt eta und der terra lliure wir zeigten die z hne im sechsten stock waren die gefangenen von cristo rey und anderen gruppen der ultrarechten
6747401 ich fuhr damit fort banken auszurauben denn ich war mehr denn je vom bewaffneten kampf berzeugt
6747402 wir waren 2000 gefangene im hungerstreik die eine humane behandlung forderten und das erreichten wir auch
6747403 sind kranke kein psychoanalytiker w rde sie diese arbeit tun lassen
6747404 eine ungerechtigkeit der grund war dass sie mich nicht im hof haben wollten sie wollten verhindern dass ich mit anderen gefangnen verabredete dass wir das was geschah anklagten ich hatte eine rechtseingabe am gericht von barcelona gewonnen aber das kostete mich ein jahr isolation einziger kontakt ein 15 min tiges telefonat alle zwei wochen

6747414 demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6747415 i will be making a submission to the court that this was a conviction obtained in the most appalling of circumstances
6747416 my client feels it was an unfair trial and a travesty of justice
6747417 we need to inquire whether this conviction should be recognised by this court
6747418 far far below what is acceptable in western european standards
6747419 therefore i decline to make an interim order as mr gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6747420 mr gadd is pleased to be back in this country the last few days as you know he has been travelling around asia and that time was not wasted it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival
6747421 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into plan a proper procedure for his protection and his well being
6747422 mr gadd is pleased to be back for another reason because there is the possibility that for the first time he can appear before a court of justice

6747431 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6747432 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6747433 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6747437 lamentablemente pod amos haber hecho otro gol pero no lo logramos por suerte se pudo defender bien ya van tres veces que se le gana a alemania pero era un partido diferente es algo maravilloso traer otra medalla para argentina
6747438 brands hatch lag uns in den letzten beiden jahren als rennstrecke immer recht gut ich denke dass der neue a4 auch dort gut funktionieren wird dass wir mit weniger gewicht starten k nnen als die 2008er mercedes kommt uns entgegen nach dem mageren ergebnis auf dem n rburgring sind wir voll motiviert in brands hatch m glichst viele punkte f r audi zu holen und die meisterschaftsf hrung auszubauen
6747439 ich denke dass wir in brands hatch ein gutes audi wochenende erleben werden wir waren dort schon 2006 und 2007 sehr schnell ich habe einen sieg und einen dritten platz geholt ich mag die strecke und will revanche f r das was am n rburgring passiert ist
6747440 brands hatch ist eine sch ne rennstrecke sehr kurz sehr klein ich bin dort letztes jahr zweiter geworden das war ein gutes rennen die englischen fans sind immer sehr begeistert von der dtm deswegen freue ich mich besonders auf dieses rennen
6747441 in brands hatch bin ich 2006 mein bisher wohl bestes dtm rennen gefahren schnellster in allen trainingssitzungen pole position und 60 runden in f hrung ehe die radaufh ngung brach letztes jahr habe ich dort wegen meines schweren unfalls gefehlt ich bin also sehr gespannt zu sehen wie schnell ich auf der kleinen aber beraus anspruchsvollen und interessanten strecke bin ich hoffe dass ich meine mechaniker und techniker f r die energie und harte arbeit entlohnen kann die sie in meinen edelwei en a4 investieren
6747442 in brands hatch starten wir mit zehn kilogramm weniger gewicht als mercedes das ist positiv wir sind schon in den letzten jahren in brands hatch gut unterwegs gewesen wir haben die sommerpause genutzt um uns optimal auf brands hatch vorzubereiten aber auch um etwas urlaub zu machen und neue energie zu tanken
6747443 ich freue mich sehr darauf wieder in brands hatch zu fahren dort habe ich im letzten jahr meine ersten punkte in der dtm geholt ich mag die strecke und die begeisterung der fans ich bin zuversichtlich dass wir dort erneut um punkte k mpfen k nnen
6747444 es ist fantastisch wieder in gro britannien ein rennen zu fahren mein letztes liegt mehr als ein jahr zur ck brands hatch ist eine ganz besondere strecke mit gro er historie ich m chte vor meinen fans und meiner familie ein gutes ergebnis erzielen
6747445 mir pers nlich ist die strecke in brands hatch eigentlich etwas zu kurz als fahrer kann man da nicht so viel herausholen trotzdem finde ich brands hatch ganz witzig vielleicht regnet es in england ja auch wir haben am n rburgring im qualifying gesehen dass wir im regen mit den alten autos ziemlich stark sind
6747446 ich freue mich sehr auf brands hatch ich bin dort im vergangenen jahr als ersatz f r tom kristensen gefahren die strecke hat mir viel spa gemacht
6747447 ich freue mich sehr vor heimischem publikum fahren zu k nnen es ist eine weile her dass ich in england ein rennen bestritten habe ich m chte mich in brands hatch weiter verbessern ich hoffe wir haben dort mit dem 2006er auto eine chance
6747448 ich war zuletzt 1996 in brands hatch das ist zw lf jahre her also ziemlich lange ich hoffe dass es trocken ist dann sollten wir sehr konkurrenzf hig sein und vielleicht sogar punkte holen k nnen
6747449 in brands hatch beginnt der endspurt in der meisterschaft mit timo scheider an der spitze sind unsere voraussetzungen sehr gut wir haben gute chancen einen sieg einzufahren audi hat beste erfahrungen in brands hatch mattias ekstr m hat dort schon gewonnen und im vergangenen jahr waren wir sehr konkurrenzf hig
6747450 es ist der k rzeste kurs des jahres und die chance ist gro dass wir alle einen drehwurm bekommen auf einer so kurzen strecke sollte mit einer guten strategie auch mit einem vorjahresauto alles m glich sein
6747451 wir haben wieder einen kleinen gewichtsvorteil gegen ber den 2007er mercedes die strecke liegt dem audi wie man letztes jahr gesehen hat es sollte m glich sein markus winkelhock wieder an gary paffett vorbeizubringen und auch das punktekonto von rocky etwas aufzubessern

6747456 mr gadd says his trial in vietnam was a charade and a travesty of justice he never got a fair trial
6747457 this morning was an opportunity for him to come before an english court and english justice for the first time and make these points
6747458 unfortunately the court did not agree to my submission that the court should hear about the unfairness of his treatment at the hands of the vietnamese justice system
6747459 mr gadd wants through me to say to you that he did not commit the offences of which he was convicted in vietnam it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his case forward

6747500 have the potential to revolutionise education in ways that are difficult to imagine
6747501 the publication of this encyclopedia underscores the extent to which political economy has come of age this encyclopedia compares very favorably to the new palgrave a dictionary of economics 1987 when compared with the concise encyclopedia of economics this encyclopedia has more depth and a greater appreciation of the range of topics relevant to economics this is an excellent reference source well suited for the non specialist seeking to understand political economy it should be available in all university libraries and departments of economics or political economy
6747502 these issues collectively constitute the life blood of contemporary economic concerns and it is extremely useful to find within a single book a discussion of the major points that define these issues w here the encyclopedia of political economy comes into its own is in an institutionally richer treatment of topics to the growing number of persons who are interested in the broader context of economics these volumes are to be highly recommended
6747503 this handsome two volume encyclopedia is an impressive stocktaking of the main concerns of political economy certainly the publication of this encyclopedia is a major landmark in the long march to develop an influential alternative to orthodox neoclassical economics
6747504 it is a tribute to oharas energy that the work was initially planned and organised by him there are indeed a number of useful and interesting articles t his is a useful collection which will feature on the reading lists of many political economy courses and hopefully as well on the shelves of many research libraries in universities around the world
6747505 this encyclopedia tells an interesting story about its purported disciplines past its current status and more ambitiously its future trajectory the result is a well demarcated intellectual legacy for political economy to draw upon in its efforts to reclaim a disciplinary mantle t ese volumes provide the a z of our discipline nicely condensed and sitting right there on our shelf this is quite an achievement
6747506 the encyclopedia is a forum for innovative work m ost of the essays seem to be thoughtfully and richly informed p articularly the entries on money credit and finance are worth reading there are undoubtedly important points being made in these essays even the specialist in monetary theory will benefit from reading various portions
6747507 all entries are organised in the same way there is thus much formal unity and impressive editorial work has been done to this end the entries are well written i find this encyclopedia definitely original and interesting it is also stimulating

6747511 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6747512 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured

6747738 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
6747739 when we recorded it we just tried to get the songs sounding as good as they possibly could and there are two songs wed never recorded that are on this record
6747740 we had talked about doing another record and theres another record on the table under our contract with metal blade we can do it if we want if we dont whatever but we have discussed doing another record and im kind of excited about tinkering with ideas for it that said if we did start writing a new album and it wasnt turning out like an overcast record i dont think wed put it out it really needs to have a certain vibe it cant be another metalcore record like the things that are going on these days it really needs to have that old school mentality which we had held true back then if not its not even worth it
6747741 we didnt want to change it too much and we didnt want it to sound like a different band
6747742 at the same time we didnt want to give fans the exact same record but we did want it to feel like the same band some of the stuff was recorded the way wed played the songs live because when youve played something 100 000 times you end up tweaking it changing it slightly so the new album reflects some of the older songs and how we used to play them live back then
6747743 im one of those dudes who needs to write constantly because i really suck at writing music with a deadline
6747744 my brain gets fried and i cant do anything i just shut down completely when we start on this next one well just bring our demos to practice and well listen to them judge them and start rearranging the parts that need to be rearranged or we just start jamming on what sounds cool

6747756 i favor the pristine and classic all u s stock market and all bond market approach
6747757 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

6747762 if he were to surprise the country and the press by naming hillary clinton as his running mate he could turn the race upside down no one else would so galvanize the democrats bring a fighter to his side and send a clear message that an obama administration would bring experience to solving problems both at home and abroad
6747763 a new poll shows obama leading mccain by three points if clinton were at the top of the ticket she would be leading mccain by six
6747764 it would be a rush if it wasnt ready i suppose but in terms of the recording we finished it in late june early july but the way media can be disseminated these days we figured if its finished then its ready to be heard i think certainly if wed decided to go the other route the cd being the first thing people heard i think we would have had to have a conversation about how we might tackle that this time around obviously the internet is such a tool for people so a lot of people dont think twice about going online to try and find music so why not use that to your advantage i suppose
6747765 we had one foot on each island as it were and in a way we were trying to remember whats been the heart of what we do
6747766 if anything with the second record there was a bit of a compromise behind it in that we were trying to marry up the two elements and not quite landing on either sort of level i suppose so why not just take it a bit further in each direction and actually follow it through a bit further
6747767 i think we just wanted to revisit some of the ways of working wed enjoyed and be a bit more choosy about where we split the various talents of those two guys and marry it up with the songs we had at that point
6747768 its a bit more disjointed in terms of the continuity it was just a different approach but im not sure if it was better or worse just a different attack and one that suited this record

6747914 we know our father we believe in him and his innocence theres no question of it haunting us that way
6747915 but justice must be served at the end of day how much more does the bn want to villify him there are so many other things at stake
6747916 were going to fight them we want his name to be cleaned hes spent six years in prison this feeling is anger not that we have doubts of his innocence
6747917 sometimes its crossed my mind to leave everything behind to lead a serene peaceful life
6747918 he said you have to come back you have to appreciate the fact that people have accepted you into a position of power we need to work on democracy we must participate in efforts to improve governance and judiciary for the stakeholders

6747920 my father was very angry during the briefings before ceramahs with supporters we always emphasise we dont condone violence and to help the journalists who are only carrying out their job even if we dont agree with their reports
6747921 but having said that we did an internal investigation we found the perpetrators were not members
6747922 we will not tolerate such behaviour certainly actions will be taken no question about that but this cannot be used as political tool to blemish against our party
6747923 its better to have issues talked about openly at least its transparent rather than putting up a brave front when the problem is not solved
6747924 even zulkifli and chong eng they could talk to each other after that of course for me i prefer if they had not said things in parliament

6747934 were no plans to cut the levels of permanent workers
6747935 this is tragic news for those workers and their families who are to lose their jobs
6747936 unfortunately it is a sign of the economic times and i know from discussions with ford that they have been reluctant to lose well trained and valuable staff
6747937 in response to softening market conditions affecting the industry ford will reduce production volumes at some of its european plants during the remainder of 2008
6747938 reductions are likely to apply to both car and commercial vehicle plants
6747939 there are no plans to reduce the levels of permanent employment as the result of this reduction in production volumes but temporary employees are being advised that their contracts will not be renewed beyond the expiry date of their current contracts in early october
6747940 there are lot of issues including availability it is unlikely to be implemented by october however what is important is the direction in which the government is making efforts

6748077 a lot of those boats got bought up and they are being chartered there are a lot of people coming down here that we dont know theyre partying and bringing friends that we dont know and causing a lot of problems in the marina
6748078 they have tried to clean themselves up its not like they are discharging but pollution goes out towards all those homes behind the marina and they phone the environment ministry and complain every year its been an on going problem
6748079 we decided on the name crop circle because the band had always had an interest in the unexplained x files had always been a favourite show of ours and it seemed to suit the direction we wanted to go with the music unexplainable
6748080 we all went our separate ways during the years and worked on different projects but one by one made our way back together
6748081 it was the very first song we wrote and we were just having fun with it on a whim we submitted it to the radio station cfox in vancouver for the seeds competition the morning guys got their hands on it and started playing the song it snowballed from there
6748082 mexican cockfight is not who we are as a band
6748083 the song recent stranger came about with brian just strumming some notes when we were working on another song we all jumped on board to what he was doing and the song came about in just one day
6748084 the video came about when i asked a bunch of friends in the area that are in the film industry if they could help us out with no budget it was unbelievable the amount of work everyone put in and the connections people had it allowed us access to very expensive equipment which made it a very professional shoot
6748085 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6748086 the reason for my ranking is that blackberry had much success with creating a device for extended e mail to mobile devices and as a result of organizations rolling out e mail as the first real enterprise app businesses wanted to leverage their hardware investment and broaden the blackberry devices extensibility as well as minimize management for multiple devices
6748087 its browser interface is very strong the cost of the solution has grown more favorable but us 400 for the initial device compared to blackberry devices was a huge impediment its new price should be more favorable for greater adoption within the enterprise but i believe apple lost some potential customers due to its initial high costs of procurement the result buyers turned to blackberries
6748088 drastically impeded penetration as sales resources that had iphones for personal use couldnt consolidate tasks to one device
6748089 they still had to use their blackberries so until recently apples iphone faced a major hurdle as resources who wanted to port over their iphone to support business activities had to depend on two devices to handle calls and e mails now though the product supports exchange so its possible iphone will gain some traction but apple isnt known for running enterprise business applications well see how that changes
6748090 the blackberry devices are just a few of many devices that support business mobile apps sprint has a wide range of solutions that can address our customers needs regardless of the device they are carrying most smartphones can support a variety of business mobile apps and most devices are compatible with gps based business applications including several rugged devices that are well suited for tough business environments
6748091 most of the solutions that have been successful outside of e mail are the more blue collar industry solutions like those focused on fleet management and field services
6748092 we started with the fact that most vendors approach was to bring in a mobile front end and build synchronization between the device and enterprise platforms
6748093 the problem with those approaches one is that from a user perspective its rather painful to learn how the mobile crm app works on their device usually a different navigation paradigm was involved and then you had to remember to keep things synchronized from an application management perspective its also quite painful it has to manage another version of the application for each device for many different models with unique features so the cost of administration for it managers isnt trivial its pretty significant
6748094 we realized the limitations of this approach and in 2004 when our partnership with rim began we sat down with them and said hey blackberry is now the de facto platform for mobile enterprise users
6748095 we leveraged the capabilities of rims push and synchronization technology so that data and communications automatically gets pushed to the user similar to the solution they came up with e mail synchronization
6748096 unlike other mobile device manufacturers who access enterprise data through their mobile internet networks blackberry has taken the approach of installing blackberry enterprise servers within firewalls that gives them access to internal enterprise systems
6748097 were looking at report and analysis distribution features as well as workforce management theres a lot of ideas in the works but we plan on tackling the most common problems first theyll be a natural extension of native capabilities on the device and well just add on more features and capabilities over time

6748102 an exercise in self indulgent narcissism what a waste of talent energy and professional competence
6748103 his idea is that i should write a big long book about my glorious media career
6748104 and he and about four other people would read that

6748120 since the moment i set foot on this site i was inspired to create a place where the full resort get away experience could be enjoyed by owners and vacationers and we are thrilled that bellstar has come on board to help us create and implement such a program
6748121 the fact that bellstar is also providing technical and planning expertise operations management and their reservations system adds greater value to the resort
6748122 but we are trying to understand the label on a juice bar
6748123 it is one of those ideas that makes you wonder why didnt someone think of this before
6748124 i had an episode with summit energy they contacted me the day after my husband died and talked to my son he told them they should talk to me because their offer sounded good they never did and i never signed anything nor did anyone else but they told terasen that i was their customer and it took endless calls and several months of higher bills and an ultimate complaint laid by me with the utilities commission before summit let me out from under what they called compassionate grounds this was without a signed contract my advice is dont even talk to these people

6748160 we do have a plant outside of shanghai we do have a plant in chennai india we have a plant in monterrey mexico but the headquarters and the brains and everything needs to stay here in chicago and i dont just mean headquarters i mean people that produce
6748161 its about technology its about people and its also about proximity to our customers american manufacturing aint over theres a lot still going on we have a lot of customers within a few hours of here and this is the right location to service them
6748162 we have so much strength here its a logical place to build how do we do it in the ravenswood corridor when so few companies can do it we do it out of some deep spirit thats been here since the founding
6748163 we had somebody lifting some scrap copper out of here a few weeks ago and he didnt get many nights putting copper into his truck to go to a scrapyard before our people tackled him and got that guy out of here who was a crooked guy because people here are not gonna tolerate that they know that their livings and welfares have come out of this plant
6748164 this is important for us they made a strong statement on behalf of the quality of work force that they see not only in chicago but in the metropolitan area
6748165 this company was started right here in the city of chicago with a person who had a dream and expanded that dream to what it is today

6748177 i have already fulfilled my obligation as a muslim by filing a complaint against the false accuser in the shariah court ibrahim said in an interview on the sidelines of a hectic campaign schedule that starts at six a
6748178 they are using dirty tactics race and making false accusations to win over the malays
6748179 this by election has yet to deliver the quality of campaigning that can generate confident optimism in malaysia s future
6748180 the barisan nasional campaign is focused on anwar s character and systematically used character assassination as a means to reduce anwar s majority
6748181 studies show that this sort of attack serves to consolidate a partys core traditional supporters and rarely sways undecided voters
6748182 does change mean a society that puts the constitution over shariah or does it mean just less corruption more accountability
6748183 the key issues of today are religious freedom rule of law judicial independence and preservation of the constitution from fundamentalists

6748185 i believe some contingent of boomers will refuse all the stereotypes associated with age and keep on going to defy the social stereotypes of every kind in the process they will be a new motor much resented for cultural change
6748186 clothing labels like olsens made by and for the baby boomer generation are among those being hardest hit by the current economic turmoil from a retailers perspective boomers tastes and attitudes are so varied that their fashion choices are no longer age specific or dedicated to one designer which is having an impact on where they shop

6748210 one of the reasons scotland didnt take to lady thatcher was because of that
6748211 we didnt mind the economic side so much but we didnt like the social side at all
6748212 im well on the record as never having approved of either margaret thatchers social or economic policies thats clear if you look at the interview
6748213 i was commenting on why scots in particular were so deeply resentful of margaret thatcher and i strongly believe that her social message of no such thing as society and the poll tax cut against the grain of scotlands social conscience
6748214 that doesnt mean that the nation liked her economic policies just that we liked her social policies even less
6748215 unfortunately under the rules we work under i cant tell you anything about mr habib thats not in the complaint
6748216 first habib said he had put a condo on the market 18 months ago but could not sell it in the slow market then he said he left two cars in the parking lot of the condo complex and that the sole purpose of his trip was to sell the two cars and furniture for 15 000
6748217 habib claimed to have sold the two vehicles for 8 000 he said he had purchased the furniture for 3 000 four years ago and sold it to a friend for 7 000 he did not have a bill of sale or receipt for the items
6748218 when asked why his friend would pay 7 000 for furniture that was purchased for 3 000 four years ago habib explained that the friend was interested in buying the condo agents asked why his friend would pay too much for used furniture in an effort to assist him in purchasing a condo that the owner couldnt sell for 18 months habib did not respond to the question
6748219 dea agents seized the 19 300 00 in u s currency based on habibs inconsistent and implausible statements
6748220 alerted to the presence of controlled substances on the currency
6748221 it is likely that trained cocaine detection dogs will alert to currency only if it has been exposed to large amounts of illicit cocaine within the very recent past
6748222 consumed over a dozen glasses of wine and several beers
6748223 failed to turn his intoxicated child over to his estranged wife or another responsible adult
6748224 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6748225 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6748226 its extremely bittersweet im thrilled that it passed and i hope and believe that my daughter had something to do with it
6748227 massachusetts has been a leader in expanding health insurance for all of its citizens and now we are focused on meeting the needs of every child
6748228 there are too many children in the commonwealth who go undiagnosed or untreated for mental illness

6748236 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6748237 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6748238 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6748239 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6748240 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6748241 its not something we are proud of that happened but its a fact
6748242 it has become a mystery that enthralls people and to that extent id love to see businesses here take advantage of that
6748243 about 600 000 tourists come to salem looking for the dark side of history

6748258 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6748259 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6748274 what we want to do is devise a system to manage large items of solid waste well into the future
6748275 this is not an event its a process once we have this system up and running and in place theres no reason why it couldnt be used year after year indefinitely
6748276 hopefully at the meeting we will know the scope of the work and we will be able to get estimates from scrap metal companies on what theyll pay and what our groupings types of waste items should be
6748277 for a long time the taliban didnt allow any girl to go to school and so now that there are laws allowing for girls to go to school i feel it is our responsibility to support them

6748413 interventions that have been created to encourage abstinence have treated abstinence and sexual activity as opposites however teenagers say they dont think of them as opposites
6748414 these abstinence only interventions are less likely to work than more comprehensive sex education programs because they are not meeting adolescents where they are and they are speaking a different language
6748415 this paper demonstrates that increasing abstinence intention does not lead to less sex in fact when abstinence intention and sex intention interact with each other a teenager is more likely to have sex
6748416 raise serious concerns about the abstinence only approach as a risk reduction method for adolescent sexual behavior
6748417 one of the most common behavioral changes cancer survivors make sometimes without a doctors advice often on their own is using dietary supplements in hopes of bolstering their health
6748418 still its unclear whether supplements really help keep cancer survivors healthier or put them at further risk they like many other people today use the internet and you can find a lot of false hope out there with supplements targeted at cancer survivors
6748419 in our study we see people taking supplements who have good diets and who are relatively healthy while they may need a particular vitamin because they dont get enough of it they may not need a multivitamin or supplement because of the increased risk of cancer recurrence or secondary cancer

6748423 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humour in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6748424 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humour

6748435 every year we experience importation of measles from other countries and from those going abroad but this year is different once measles is imported here were seeing it spread to many more people
6748436 many cases are in children who are eligible for vaccination but who have not been immunized because of parents decisions
6748437 we need very high levels of population immunity approximately 95 percent
6748438 we have been lucky to have low levels of measles and other vaccine preventable diseases but children can still get measles and can still spread measles including to those too young to be immunized and those who cant be vaccinated because of medical reasons
6748439 its important in this country to maintain high levels of vaccination that have been so successful in limiting measles to relatively low numbers over the last decade we would like to remind parents as their children go back to school whether or not they attend in schools or are home schooled or attend day care this is a good time to be considering their vaccination status for measles to protect them from acquiring this disease
6748440 the greatest benefits and least risk from hrt are seen in the 99 percent of women who commence hrt for symptom relief near menopause this trial studied much older women who started hrt on average 13 to 14 years after menopause when they had fewer symptoms even in this group improved quality of life was seen in many taking hrt
6748441 i think this is an important study because since whi many have lost sight of the significant benefits of hormone therapy
6748442 this study reinforces the notion that for women with these symptoms hrt can improve your quality of life and the worse your symptoms the more theyll improve
6748443 for relief of symptoms its ok to go on hrt as long as you have none of the absolute contraindications like a history of deep vein thrombosis
6748444 the medicare drug benefit has produced tangible relief for millions of people despite the unusual coverage gap that was created to make the benefit fit within budget constraints
6748445 but if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
6748446 most people do not think that young people have strokes
6748447 but the point people should really understand is that they can occur in utero they can occur in the neonatal period and they can occur in older children there are noticeable differences in presentation risk factors and the prognosis in children compared to older adults however
6748448 people are like kids dont have strokes so i still think theres a lot of work to be done in terms of awareness
6748449 the prognosis at the beginning wasnt very good eighty five to 90 percent of the brain tissue on his left side is gone the doctors thought hed be in a wheelchair that hed never be able to walk or talk he struggles a bit and it may take him a little longer but he does it all now
6748450 typically its the undecided voter that gives politicians a hard time its the undecided voters that you need to get
6748451 this study shows that by using these measures there is some potential for improving the prediction of election outcomes
6748452 the inspiration for this study came from the development of a particular class of measures that enables us to assess these automatic mental associations
6748453 over the past couple of years a lot of research has shown that these measures are able to predict behaviors that psychologists have had a hard time predicting with standard methodology or self report
6748454 this type of measure in the domain of prejudice and stereotyping has found that in north america there is a large proportion of individuals with relatively negative views of african americans even people who hold very strong egalitarian opinions or beliefs sometimes show negative associations
6748455 this can influence their voting behavior particularly for undecided voters in a way that they may not be aware of
6748456 we know that there is still a strong prevalence of automatic negative associations regarding african americans and this may have distorted peoples perception of the political process public debates etc
6748457 theyve made up their mind who theyre going to vote for even though theyre undecided when the polls are taken this could happen again in the u s it may be the case that the big advance that obama has at this point may completely shift in the election
6748458 our study confirms that women experience significant bone loss due to cancer treatments and that zoledronic acid can prevent this loss
6748459 while our findings are promising its too early for us to recommend this drug for all premenopausal women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer because we dont yet have all the information we need on dosing cost effectiveness and whether this drug actually prevents bone fractures
6748460 however this research does show we need to be more vigilant about monitoring patients bone densities before and during treatment so we can protect bone health and offset bone fracture or osteoporosis risk
6748461 but dont you feel that art history is an inadequate descriptive model

6748507 we are indeed distressed that our previous analysis of this issue was in error
6748508 larger percentage of patients treated with vytorin were diagnosed with and died from all types of cancer combined when compared to treatment with a placebo
6748509 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6748510 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment ldl cholesterol
6748511 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6748512 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher ldl levels
6748513 this is especially true of cancers involving the blood cell system but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6748514 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers
6748515 this is the first report to conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases tobacco use
6748516 its the first report to make the conclusion that there is a causal relationship between exposure to depiction of smoking in the movies and youth beginning to smoke
6748517 cigarettes are one of the most heavily marketed products in the united states
6748518 now it is up to the government to consider the evidence and think about what it needs to do in terms of advertising and promotion
6748519 this report sends an unmistakable message to our elected officials that they can dramatically reduce tobacco use by children and by adults by passing legislation that would authorize the food and drug administration to regulate tobacco products and by adequately funding their state prevention and cessation programs
6748520 it appears that many of the conclusions in the report are based on marketing practices that are more than 30 or 40 years old
6748521 we think its important to focus on the marketing practices that we have in place today
6748522 facial transplantation could be successful in the short term but the procedure is not without complications this case suggests facial transplantation might be an option for restoring a severely disfigured face and could enable patients to readily integrate themselves back into society
6748523 our case confirms that face transplantation is surgically feasible and effective for the correction of specific disfigurement due in this case to a genetic disorder long term follow up is needed to assess the risks linked to the immunogenicity of allogenic composite tissues particularly as regards life expectancy following this initial success other patients are currently being assessed

6748547 these results confirm that elesclomol powerfully and selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells by increasing the level of reactive oxygen species ros beyond sustainable levels
6748548 elevated ros levels and susceptibility to further increases in ros are fundamental characteristics of cancer cells that differentiate them from normal non cancerous cells exploiting this special vulnerability represents a novel approach to selectively targeting and killing cancer cells the findings also suggest that elesclomol can substantially enhance the efficacy of certain other anti cancer therapies when given in combination these results collectively indicate the potential of oxidative stress induction as a new therapeutic option for treating multiple types of cancers either as a single agent or in combination we are excited by the potential of this new mechanism category particularly for difficult to treat cancers such as melanoma that have not been responsive to chemotherapy or other prior approaches
6748549 these new findings highlight the potential of oxidative stress induction
6748550 cancer types that may be especially sensitive to this mechanism are those known to have particularly high levels of oxidative stress including melanoma prostate breast ovarian and hematologic cancers

6748553 we have several cars and industry experts like who killed the electric car stars colette divine and paul scott to dispel those myths and show people that evs are a real cost saving higher performing alternative to gas powered vehicles the reason is that electric motors are more efficient than gasoline engines using drastically less energy they also have only a few moving parts whereas their gas powered counterparts have hundreds resulting in more maintenance expenses in addition to gas expenses over the long term

6748560 we believe this compelling combination would create a strong platform for sustainable long term growth to better address the changing healthcare industry and provide meaningful cost effective medicines that improve the quality of life for patients
6748561 the transaction would create a diversified specialty pharmaceutical company with greater commercialization capabilities an expanded portfolio of pain management products and a strengthened pipeline which would include multiple platform technologies
6748562 our 33 00 per share all cash proposal provides alpharma stockholders with a substantial cash premium for their investment in the company we are confident that this combination would deliver significant benefits and superior value to our respective stockholders and employees and create a stronger platform to deliver innovation to patients prescribers and customers importantly it would also further diversify kings business with an additional source of steady cash flow from alpharmas animal health division a leading feed additives business in addition a combination with alpharma would deliver significant synergies
6748563 we believe our all cash proposal is too compelling to ignore in light of the fact that the alpharma board declined this proposal we think it is important for the stockholders of both companies to be aware of this exciting opportunity it remains our strong preference to work cooperatively with alpharma regarding this proposal

6748817 the court ruled to deny the petition and the decision can be appealed within 10 days in the chita regional court
6748818 the first reason is that khodorkovsky failed to learn the profession of a sewing machine operator and this despite his education intellect and managerial experience the second reason is a reprimand issued on october 15 2007 by the penal colonys administration for failing to comply with an order to put his hands behind his back
6748819 i cannot repent crimes that did not exist i cannot do this not only because of my belief in the unjustness of the verdict but also because of my fear for the fate of many other people who have become hostages of the situation related to my conviction
6748820 as to the damages it should be clarified that prior to my arrest yukos was worth about 40 billion us dollars today i no longer own anything if somebody believes that some additional damages have been inflicted after completion of the story with yukos they have been repaid with a vengeance
6748821 we ask russia to tear up the agreement on friendship cooperation and partnership with ukraine and to file territorial claims to ukraine
6748822 while russia sent aid to flood hit ukrainian regions ukraine failed to help russia to force georgia to peace and took an openly hostile stance
6748823 ukraine has proved by its policies that it is not a friend but an enemy to russia

6748826 i am doing a commercial report and curriculum development on the evolving range of social virtual worlds and have recently ventured into fifty of them to review and sample the culture creative business and educational potential on my travels i got out my virtual camera and decided to capture a bunch of small vignettes which quickly turned into a body of audio visual delights so decided to create a nice seven minute video for posterity
6748827 out of my research on this has come a list of tools technologies and other artifacts of my generation that will probably disappear within the next generation just as fax essentially disappeared less than 20 years after it first became popular and just as cds which my generation thought were the last word in music storage are disappearing even faster
6748828 learning what they dont know about their storage environment is the number one driver for customers purchasing our file management solution once they better understand the makeup of the files in their storage infrastructure our file virtualization technology delivers reduced complexity and operating costs real and immediate value when it budgets are under pressure

6748830 the water has covered the beach there isnt really any beach left at all
6748831 we havent been out since tuesday because of the bad driving
6748832 it was hard to see because of all of the rain but we have plenty of canned food
6748833 as far as we know we cant leave our condominiums to get to highway a1a because the police are blocking it

6748844 this event with the prime minister leading the convoy symbolises that the people are behind datuk seri dr mahathir in crossing the bridge over economic problems
6748845 we the people of malaysia irrespective of race and religion will continuously support the prime minister in his efforts to lead the nation out of the turmoil
6748846 we the people of malaysia believe that malaysia can overcome the economic turmoil under the leadership of datuk seri dr mahathir mohamad our nation our responsibility malaysia boleh
6748847 this is the longest single brand car convoy in the world we will apply that this event be listed in the malaysia book of records and the guiness book of records as the longest convoy of a single brand of cars ever
6748848 i will not step down and it is also not true that i have tendered my resignation
6748849 i told them i will continue working and that i will not retreat
6748850 also i have heard on numerous occasions claims that i have tendered my resignation but it is not true
6748851 the government and umno should take stern action against the rumour mongers and the mastermind
6748852 they should not be allowed to move about freely where are the authorities who are supposed to take action against them
6748853 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6748854 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6748855 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6748856 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6748857 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6748858 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6748859 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6748860 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6748861 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6748862 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6748863 if you trust every web site but not a government
6748864 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6748865 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6748866 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6748867 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6748868 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6748869 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6748870 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6748871 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6748872 he did not commit the offense for which he was convicted
6748873 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the u s where we can do that
6748874 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
6748875 i have to were not changing generals in the middle of the war thats what they do over in iraq every other week theres a new damn general over there
6748876 were going to be here and were going to see this through and then well see where the chips fall but im not leaving until we have a deal
6748877 weve begun already talking about the succession process prior to this well continue along those lines that weve already been on and will identify those individuals and hopefully well come up with that one person who will be able to lead us and bring us even further than we are right now
6748878 youre talking about a man whos left behind an incredible legacy from where we started at way back in the day to where it is today with what the league is bringing in dollarwise and all the player benefits and different things gene has had a hand in hes left this organization in a very very good place
6748879 weve learned in the nfl that not everybody is the enemy
6748880 we all have to work together if we have prosperity we have to keep the peace not make war
6748881 paul and i have had discussions about how people perceive us
6748882 we have a relationship where we can just sit down and talk without even talking about business we can talk about the history of the game about what hes been through what ive been through
6748883 all of those things are why weve had success paul and i always tried to look at everything from each others perspective if we know what the common good is we know where we have to go its never been about either one of us trying to one up the other its always been about what can we do to make our product better and grow it if people dont understand that thats their problem not ours
6748884 few people in the history of the nfl have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6748885 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6748886 the position he took of creating a partnership with the owners and getting a meaningful majority of the gross revenues and then focusing on building the revenue pot to raise the boat of all the players was absolutely right it was a total win for everybody its hard to imagine there are many people who wouldve been in his position and had the foresight to think of this as an option
6748887 but i never got the chance i ended up coming here to the nflpa
6748888 but thats ok its not going to stop me from doing what i have to do but it does enter the picture from time to time they dont want to accept that i can do this job its always a little tougher
6748889 if i dont teach you right from wrong then the world surely will
6748890 there is no truth to media reports that syria had agreed to deploy iskander missiles on its territory
6748891 defensive weapons which are not breaking the regional balance of power
6748892 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6748893 i guess the weirdest one is a guy in germantown who won powerball not because he had a formula but because he went out to take the garbage out and he heard a voice telling him which numbers to play
6748894 im not really sure what their secret is mr adamson says he has what he refers to as a recipe
6748895 were in the random chance business and when you deal with random chance anything thats possible even if its improbable can happen
6748896 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6748897 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6748898 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6748899 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6748900 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6748901 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6748902 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6748903 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6748904 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6748905 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6748906 he had no idea until sunday he had any problem nor did we or anyone else
6748907 his family and i were the only ones who knew gene had a very aggressive form of pancreatic cancer
6748908 i think gene is one of the most pivotal people in the history of the nfl
6748909 players past and present had no better friend than gene upshaw with time people will come to fully understand and appreciate his contributions and his legacy it was genes strength and conviction that got the players to where they are today
6748910 i would say no life is easily reduced to one issue and we had our issues and hes caused some suffering but theres still some humanity and our hearts and prayers go out to his family
6748911 upshaw was an easy target but the problem was bigger than him it is the institution itself and the commissioner he would be the pi ata and take the beating and make it seem that one man was taking the shots but the problem is more than just him
6748912 a lot of people forget theres no such thing as unanimous support in any body you represent but from a results standpoint what more could you want the retired players some of them are getting four times what they would have gotten if gene hadnt been there the stuff about being too close to tagliabue id like to have anyone explain to me how the players havent been served by gene the owners just opted out of this labor deal because it was such a bad deal for them and such a good deal for the players
6748913 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6748914 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6748915 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6748916 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6748917 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6748918 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6748919 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6748920 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6748921 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6748922 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6748923 le deseamos a vincent todo lo mejor en el futuro
6748924 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6748925 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6748926 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6748927 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6748928 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6748929 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6748930 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6748931 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6748932 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6748933 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6748934 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6748935 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6748936 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6748937 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6748938 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6748939 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6748940 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6748941 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6748942 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6748943 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6748944 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6748945 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6748946 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6748947 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6748948 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6748949 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6748950 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6748951 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6748952 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6748953 hay dos borradores de resoluciones sobre la mesa y mi lectura es que el consejo no est en disposici n de respaldar a ninguno de los dos
6748954 cant stand the sort of big bragging boasting of very wealthy countries who have better nutrition better everything and they seem to want to beguile you into this fanatic nationalism that they are better
6748955 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6748956 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6748957 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6748958 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6748959 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6748960 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6748961 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6748962 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6748963 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6748964 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6748965 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6748966 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6748967 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6748968 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6748969 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6748970 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6748971 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6748972 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6748973 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6748974 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6748975 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6748976 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6748977 shes this little freshman and she scores two goals against us both of them off her head
6748978 it was such a proud moment to think about how far she has come and the impact south jersey girls soccer has had on the world
6748979 that was one of our own over there scoring the game winning goal to give the usa the gold medal
6748980 she worked on her own to get incredibly fit flexible and strong to become a complete player
6748981 lloyd is such an asset to the team that many times i come away thinking shes the best player on the pitch and thats not just for the usa but for everyone
6748982 we ran a camp at moorestown this summer and carli came out and she was great with the girls encouraging them signing autographs doing whatever she could to help out
6748983 i know these athletes usually get paid for things like that but she wouldnt take a dime
6748984 when it comes to founders we know we are usually going to see something odd
6748985 in some cases they are exorbitantly paid and in others they are paid miserly
6748986 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6748987 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6748988 i know i could take some flak for censorship but its an educational opportunity and thats how we plan to handle it
6748989 a lot of these guys were in the dominican and venezuelan summer leagues they want to grow fast and a related factor is that when they get here theyre generally younger than the guys theyre competing with most of whom were drafted out of college so sometimes they look for a shortcut but there are no shortcuts
6748990 we continue to talk about in detail to prospects its like pfp pitchers fielding practice repeat repeat repeat i think we also have to make sure we have bilingual doctors in latin america who understand the commissioners drug policy
6748991 i would rather lose a game than take a chance of hurting anybody
6748992 you cant stress enough that the hero stuff sometimes works in the world but it doesnt work here
6748993 just like this happened with some questionable home run calls something else will happen a play at first a play at second its not going to end its like pandoras box be careful what you wish for
6748994 i dont care if were on a 50 game trip
6748995 you have to be fired up to go out there and play these games because they mean something
6748996 good news is theres nothing wrong with my eyesight the bad news is i just flat out stink right now
6748997 id have probably had him get rid of it the first day
6748998 but then i wouldnt have been there the next day
6748999 its a different era an altogether different era from when i managed six teams from 1967 to 1988
6749000 he has gotten ownership to do some things that did not take place not just for me but for the ones before me
6749001 the ownership made a commitment from top to bottom to put more into it and theyre getting better results
6749002 whether we will be a wanted or an unwanted resident or a good corporate citizen
6749003 the move will be at great cost to tata motors and to shareholders but there is a concern about our people a definite concern about not being wanted
6749004 we have not come to exploit the people of west bengal
6749005 payments were made for corrupt ends by an intermediary of alstom prom ag located in baden
6749006 these sums were transferred by other companies of the alstom group to public servants or officials of various countries in cases determining the awarding of contracts

6749008 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6749009 i suppose if youve got seven maybe eight houses the economy looks fundamentally sound to you

6749011 i make this point not to simply give john mccain a hard time its indicative of a different world view about whats happening in america
6749012 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into

6749019 upon completion this test system will further ensure the service reliability of our entire network a key metric of our customer service programs

6749022 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6749023 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6749024 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6749025 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

6749035 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6749036 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6749037 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6749038 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

6749040 theyre pretty much the same as far as i can see
6749041 i threw away my vote on ron paul just on impulse knowing he couldnt win
6749042 but i think obama would have a lot of trouble with the politicians who have been around for a while
6749043 spending behind the united states presidential election and around the beijing olympic games should continue to boost 2008 revenues
6749044 levels of activity in 2008 should match those seen in 2007 and there are significant new business opportunities
6749045 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6749046 in addition the new united states president will have to wrestle with twin fiscal and budget deficits in early 2009 and post the olympics chinese growth may slow due to inflationary particularly food price concerns and the impact that a weakening united states economy has on the rest of the world
6749047 position the group very well to weather any economic slowdown
6749048 soasta and isomorphic have created a bridge between cloudtest and smartclient that creates extremely robust tests so you can invest in a comprehensive test suite with confidence
6749049 the first day of school can be so scary especially the first day of kindergarten or preschool
6749050 it can be such a traumatic situation for a child if they are not ready for it
6749051 it was a very close knit friendship with one ideal to help the jews
6749052 he got really angry but i told him if youre angry we wont make a deal
6749053 he went out there and risked his neck in actual negotiations
6749054 we have a record number of new students this year
6749055 we try hard to give each of them tours and show them around the school but we wanted to do more
6749056 this is a great day when you can begin the school year with your parents who helped you to be here today
6749057 a student is one who is striving and trying hard to learn if you were perfect and knew everything you wouldnt have to go to school
6749058 deep in our hearts we have to have meaning in our lives and be recognized for the person you are and the things you have done
6749059 let us have a good year it wont be perfect but the lord will cover our imperfections
6749060 the first day will be less nerve wracking because i know that if i get scared hes right there
6749061 we match them up with their teachers right here so they dont have to worry about finding their homeroom themselves
6749062 you werent smiling too much at first do you remember

6749069 we were joking about calling them mary kate and ashley im not kidding i really thought about that
6749070 we also thought about maybe rhyming their names but then is that a little hansel and gretel
6749071 im really excited about having girls i know guys are supposed to say i want a boy but i just have a feeling im going to be good with girls
6749072 im just going to raise a couple of assassins theyre going to be tough chicks
6749073 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6749074 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6749075 this was a difficult decision but it was the right one there is nothing more important than the safety of our national team
6749076 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6749077 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6749078 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6749079 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6749080 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6749081 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6749082 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6749083 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6749084 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6749085 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6749096 no we cant because the electricity is turned off because of your father
6749097 what if instead of going to the movies we take a flashlight and go for a walk after dark tonight
6749098 instead of buying that toy how about we make some play dough together
6749099 instead of driving to the park lets make tents in the dining room by putting sheets over the table and eating snacks under the table while we read together
6749100 no internet lets write each other letters the old fashioned way

6749102 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6749103 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6749104 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6749105 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6749106 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6749107 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6749108 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6749109 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6749110 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6749111 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6749112 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6749117 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6749118 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6749119 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6749120 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6749121 the number of us military bases would depend on the size and the needs of the troops
6749122 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6749123 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6749124 its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that

6749126 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa

6749130 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6749131 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

6749137 we need to think about it but i wouldnt want to spoil the story
6749138 weve spent a lot of time working on the story this time weve worked with people from hollywood script writers to really make it just right and i think its a very unusual story for a videogame so i think people will be quite surprised
6749139 this is something its really too early to talk about but its definitely a possibility theres so many possibilities with this thing because what matters now is just the story you want to tell do you have a good story to tell then you can do it because this thing isnt specific to the series you can tell any story with this interface because its entirely contextual
6749140 how on earth will six girls going to fit on that stage
6749141 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6749142 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6749143 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6749144 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6749145 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6749146 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6749147 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6749148 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6749149 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6749150 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6749151 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6749152 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6749153 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6749156 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6749157 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6749158 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6749159 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6749160 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6749161 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6749162 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

6749167 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6749168 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6749169 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie

6749171 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

6749183 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6749184 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

6749218 reading in paris about kashmiri muslims rioting because of land transferred to the shri amarnathji shrine board sasb and the peoples democratic party pulling out of the jammu and kashmir government coalition one feels a little bit surprised
6749219 millions of devotees have flocked to amarnath over the centuries and muslims from kashmir should show them generosity because in india although muslims have been a minority since the beginning hindus have always respected the religion of islam
6749220 furthermore indian muslims returning from the gulf have built in the last 20 years tens of thousands of mosques thanks to the gulf money often with land donated by the indian government and without the hindus ever protesting
6749221 kashmir is also the land of sufism where the best of islam and vedanta blended which allowed many generations of kashmiri hindus and muslims to worship together in mosques and temples and attend each others festivals unfortunately after the creation of pakistan a hard sunni fundamentalism has entered the valley mainly with pakistan and afghan jihadis and four lakh kashmiri hindus have been forced by death terror and violence to flee the valley of their ancestors one of the biggest ethnic cleansings in human history

6749226 chelsea were very good but portsmouth had a bad day at the office that can happen to anybody before they could even get into the game it was already over for them

6749229 there was not one factor why we fell away last season it was a conjunction of a few things like injuries some bad luck as well as a bit of inexperience and nervousness

6749231 but i think we have the right number of players who can compete at the top level when everyone is fit
6749232 that is not the case at the moment but through the season we should get guys like abou diaby tomas rosicky and eduardo back

6749344 a species of red algae for instance produces under increased ultraviolet radiation less red light harvesting proteins thus decreasing the absorption of radiation the typical red colour of the alga fades and the plant gets white tips
6749345 the algae additionally produce substances which react similar to melanin in human skins mycosporin amino acids maa
6749346 we examine the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation on algae and their protective mechanisms
6749347 our investigations show that the distribution of certain species of brown algae is inhibited by the climate of ultraviolet radiation the algae are displaced into deeper water layers if ultraviolet radiation increases
6749348 we want to observe the development of marine coastal ecosystems in the face of global climate change not only an increased ultraviolet radiation plays a decisive role but also the water temperature which has been increased by the greenhouse effect this increase in temperature can particularly be felt on spitsbergen in the atlantic sector of the arctic

6749422 it was a very close knit friendship with one ideal to help the jews
6749423 he got really angry but i told him if youre angry we wont make a deal
6749424 he went out there and risked his neck in actual negotiations
6749425 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world

6749429 cash flow is a better measure of the discretionary resources available to firms than profits
6749430 but while prices profits and cash flow have risen dramatically investment in exploration has not especially by the largest iocs
6749431 development expenditures reflect investments in fields that have already been discovered and are the easiest most cost effective way to boost output in the short run nonetheless it is investment in the exploration of new fields that will assure the long term viability of these firms
6749432 share buybacks equity repurchases have absorbed a growing share of these outlays rising from only 1 in 1993 to 37 1 in 006 while expenditures on exploration account for a decreasing proportion declining from 13 8 in 1993 to only 5 8 in 006 it is interesting to note that despite an almost 50 increase in exploration expenditures from 006 these expenditures as a share of the total increased from 5 3 to only 5 8
6749433 smaller firms are more aggressive in spending for reserves additions than the big five through growing exploration outlays and through acquisitions from other firms
6749434 the big five are gradually depleting their reserves with an average replacement ratio of only 8
6749435 to some extent the decline for the big five is attributable to the downward restatement of reserves especially by royal dutch shell
6749436 the oil production of the five largest oil companies has declined since the mid 1990s oil production for the five largest oil companies fell from 10 5 million b d in 1996 to 9 45 million b d in 2 005 before rebounding to 9 7 million b d in
6749437 increasingly the iocs have become more like general contractors coordinating the operation of a number of suppliers who themselves are the ones who undertake seismic work analyze data provide drilling rigs and crews and a host of oil field services the larger iocs also serve the function of bankers providing the vast amount of financial resources required to projects in increasingly unfavorable and difficult environments they also provide the management organizational skills and oversight that these large projects require

6749443 no matter what they do to try to tailor the game to brett they still cant recreate green bay
6749444 so were going to see brett favre play a little different style and im really excited about it
6749445 im hoping its more play action i hope hes holding the ball more dropping deeper i want to see him throw it down the field more because everyone says gunslinger great arm but green bay led the league in short passes
6749446 as a coach you try to decide where that line is and where do we go before we endanger brett favre
6749447 i cant remember when ive heard this kind of buzz in new york about football really ever
6749448 hes certainly given a shot in the arm to this city its been great it seems like its all we talk about on the radio
6749449 the first month is going to be really really difficult
6749450 when you go from one playbook to another its like learning a completely different language its not going to be easy im just trying to temper everyones enthusiasm he has a lot to learn and cant go out there and just fling it
6749451 the mental side is going to be tough but i think he can go out there and just fling it he is the best at just flinging it since you boomer
6749452 i think he is one of the five best throwers of the football ever in the history of the nfl he played in green bay all those years i think he can deal with the meadowlands
6749453 as far as adapting to terminology and plays if theres anybody in the league who can do it its him because of the experience hes had football is football you read coverages coverages dont change much its just the approach to the offense
6749454 it was a little frustrating at first because i kind of had my mind set on one thing just playing will
6749455 but after doing it for a couple of weeks now its turned out to be a good thing because im learning the whole defense
6749456 sometimes i feel that way but im just trying to be positive about it
6749457 on one side i feel like they dont know what to do with me but im just trying to use it as an opportunity to learn the whole defense
6749458 i think they are just trying to get everyone familiar with all the spots because you never know whats going to happen
6749459 guys have been banged up even in camp they are trying to get us all familiar
6749460 no one has won the spot but i feel like i have a great opportunity to win it
6749461 ive got to go out and have a spectacular game this weekend and follow it up in our last game of the preseason and i think ill be in good shape im very optimistic about winning the spot but at the same time i know i have a lot of work to do
6749462 hes been great and i think its translating to some good things on the field
6749463 he just came in fit in and everyone welcomed him each and every day hes been getting more and more comfortable with everyone here
6749464 once chemistry out on the field develops you can gradually get toward that point where you dont have to do anything verbally you can just understand each other and get a good feel for each other on the field
6749465 he threatens the defense and threatens the entire field so there arent any clear out routes you have to be available on each and every route
6749466 some routes youre not the primary guy but with brett you may end up the primary guy so you have to stay honest on each and every route
6749467 i just know theres a lot of zip on the ball
6749468 it helps especially when youre trying to fit into tight spots especially against man coverage hes fitting into those spots so it lets you know youre going to have the opportunity to make a play

6749479 sit down with kids and get them to start thinking about their hopes and dreams and goals for the future
6749480 one of the best gifts parents can give is to help kids figure out who they are
6749481 ultimately school is about learning as much as you can to be successful in life

6749483 if you have a goal you have to have a plan
6749484 its a way to sort of understand whats important to you
6749485 one of the huge things we see on the first day is kids who dont have school supplies
6749486 i dont think parents realize what a huge deal it is
6749487 there is literally a book for every age and stage
6749488 your most important job is what you do at school

6749494 and i thought it had to be a hoax because it was all of a sudden i tried to search online and learned it was true it was very sad to hear
6749495 the national football league is deeply saddened by the loss of gene upshaw
6749496 it is a shock to most of us not even knowing that he was ill he is a hall of famer he has been in the position of leadership for the players association for 25 years he is a guy that has earned his stripes so to speak and it was very very difficult to learn this and not even know there was anything wrong
6749497 he was the man who started it and got it organized with a lot of help from other people his services to the league for five decades wont be questioned his services to the players wont be questioned
6749498 i think hell be remembered as a guy that had the best interest of the players and took a stand
6749499 weve come a long way as a union and as a league
6749500 gene was just a fixture hes been there since the beginning as a hall of fame player and as a union leader bookkeeper
6749501 i came into the league in 1985 and i knew him from a distance then
6749502 by the time the strike came in 1987 you could see how driven he was to advance our cause i just grew to have the utmost respect for what hes been able to do ever since
6749503 i think his legacy will be that of one of the very few people who had a very significant impact on the national football league
6749504 he had an impact as a player and as a union leader and as good as he was as a player his impact as a union leader far outweighs that he benefited thousands of people past present and future players
6749505 but no one could ultimately question from a big picture standpoint the job he has done the job he was doing and the job he would have done
6749506 its gonna take a lot more than that my friend

6749512 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6749513 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6749541 there is a lot of stock on the market and not so many buyers around so that is obviously not good news but there has been a reversal in the trend to buy first and sell later
6749542 people are putting their homes up for sale first and that means they can afford to sit it out so we are not necessarily seeing big price drops because people are not prepared to agree to that
6749543 the 2 000 grant for first time buyers which they withdrew would have helped the situation the measures they are taking do not suit the market as a whole

6749573 private investors have accumulated significant amounts of equity in buy to let properties after a long period of strong growth in home and flat values
6749574 higher mortgage rates and falling property prices will cause investors to reconsider their exposure to residential property and many will choose a more diversified approach
6749575 with inflation rising investors realise the need for strategies that preserve their wealth
6749576 one of the key reasons for the success of the chevrolet cobalt and pontiac g5 is the lordstown workforce and the strong partnerships with the uaw and local and state officials
6749577 based on the quality of work and these strong partnerships we are pleased to announce our plans to invest another 500 million in the chevy cruze product program in the u s including more than 350 million in lordstown
6749578 the cruze will build on the already successful chevrolet cobalt cobalt xfe and cobalt ss all of which are nearly sold out in dealer showrooms
6749579 our dealers are asking for many more cobalts than we can build
6749580 the chevrolet cruze was designed and engineered by our global teams in europe and asia pacific and will be manufactured in those regions in addition to the assembly plant here in lordstown ohio
6749581 our goal for the chevrolet cruze is to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment
6749582 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6749583 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6749584 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6749585 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6749586 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6749587 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6749588 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6749589 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6749590 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6749591 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6749592 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6749593 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6749594 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6749595 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6749596 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6749597 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6749598 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6749599 no mans life liberty or property is safe while the legislature is in session
6749600 knowing how low self esteem and depression plague many single females we wanted to spread the message that happily ever after can occur even before prince charming arrives or even if he never does
6749601 were not anti family or anti marriage if anything were anti damsel in distress our message the single life can also be a fairy tale the end
6749602 is found by loving god being kind to others and being comfortable with who you are already
6749603 weve had countless women all over the nation tell us they wish there had been a book like this when they were young
6749604 this is a story women can truly believe in and feel comfortable sharing with their children

6749606 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6749607 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6749608 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6749609 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6749610 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6749611 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6749612 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6749613 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6749614 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6749615 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6749616 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6749617 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6749618 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6749619 only 38 percent of the uks total water use comes from its own rivers lakes and groundwater reserves
6749620 the rest is taken from water resources often stressed or very likely to become so in the near future
6749621 understanding our footprint can be a key tool to further guide the development of more water saving products
6749622 feeding everyone including the undernourished and additional 3 billion people expected in 2050 will require 50 percent more water than is needed today
6749623 to be realizing that goal and certainly under the various circumstances that weve dealt with throughout this tournament it feels phenomenal
6749624 weve seen not getting out of the pool to getting out of our pool barely getting past the quarters and losing in the bronze medal match now going to the gold medal match so we have quite the array of experience on this team
6749625 it was just two teams giving everything they had and luckily enough we pulled it out in the end
6749626 it easily could have went either way that fifth set was amazing because it was just so back and forth back and forth nobody really got a big lead at all and we have confidence that we have the players that can make some key plays at the end and thats kind of what happened
6749627 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6749628 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6749629 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6749630 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6749631 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6749632 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6749633 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6749634 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6749635 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6749636 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6749637 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6749638 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6749639 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6749640 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6749641 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6749642 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6749643 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6749644 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6749645 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6749646 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6749647 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6749648 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6749649 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6749650 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6749651 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6749652 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6749653 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6749654 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6749655 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6749656 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6749657 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6749658 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6749659 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here

6749662 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6749663 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6749664 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

6749680 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6749681 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many

6749740 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6749741 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living

6749743 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets

6749751 38 percent of prote ge s who worked with mentors a few times a year reported substantial improvements to their instructional skills that figure jumps to an impressive 88 percent for those who work with mentors at least once a week
6749752 they felt the school district could have done a better job in selecting their mentors
6749753 he just didnt have the time to meet with the mentor or plan his lessons
6749754 we understood that we probably wouldnt have the time needed to carry out all of the mentoring conversations that we needed to have so we just did the best we could
6749755 the administration and the school board were out to get me
6749756 it felt like i was being left out in the cold with very little support
6749757 they very much appreciated the effort that their mentoring coordinator had made on their behalf
6749758 we appreciated the problem solving time we were given in the workshops to talk about problems we were having and how we might deal with them in a more effective way
6749759 i had communicated information to the new teacher that was not accurate but i didnt know it until the mentoring coordinator brought it to my attention
6749760 just not working out and decided to talk to the mentoring coordinator first
6749761 they just didnt feel as though they were a good match from the start and it really didnt make any difference what the coordinator did it just didnt seem to work
6749762 our personalities are so different and we both have pretty strong personalities that the give and take that we expected just wasnt there
6749763 it wasnt that i didnt want to help i felt very responsible for creating opportunities to meet which didnt always work because we were in different schools
6749764 the mentoring coordinator should have made that assignment in the beginning rather than wait until a problem developed
6749765 i didnt quite understand why we were assigned a mentor in another building but when they found out that it was becoming a problem they acted pretty fast in accommodating us
6749766 i dont think that the training my mentor received was real helpful although she provides some support it wasnt enough to make a difference
6749767 they began to realize in the conversations that they were having with the coordinator that there are degrees of support and what may work for one new teacher may not work for another that was helpful information
6749768 the school district should have known this wasnt going to be a good match for us but after they realized there was a problem they provided the help we needed
6749769 both of us were disappointed that the school district didnt provide us with mentors that taught at the same grade level but at this point were very happy with the mentor we now have mainly because we got to pick them
6749770 we realize that placement at grade level is really the ideal situation for the mentor and new teacher but when you dont have a veteran teacher with at least 3 years of experience required by the mentoring program then you have to do the next best thing
6749771 this arrangement really didnt work out too well the principal was really nice about helping me out but he just didnt have the time that i needed and i hated to keep bothering him with questions when he was already so busy with his regular duties
6749772 i felt that the administrator was responding to an easy fix for the new teacher and i certainly didnt feel like i was valued in the selection process
6749773 i just dont have the time to mentor someone new and because i was not given a choice in the matter i have to say im pretty uncomfortable with this arrangement but ill do it anyway
6749774 i cant believe that my mentor was told that he would have to mentor me talk about a forced issue im extremely uncomfortable with even doing this at this point

6749780 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6749781 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6749782 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6749783 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

6749825 come posso averti vista e ora non sapere chi sei
6749826 ah non conosci mio padre hai mai limpressione che se dici a qualcuno chi sei non verrai accettato
6749827 i know that youre entitled to your opinion and i respect that
6749828 it wasnt an opinion it was a sheer passioned hate
6749829 oh ive been talking about you behind your back as well
6749830 tu fino ad ora per me non sei che un ragazzino uguale a centomila ragazzini e non ho bisogno di te e neppure tu hai bisogno di me io non sono per te che una volpe uguale a centomila volpi ma se tu mi addomestichi noi avremo bisogno uno dellaltro tu sarai per me unico al mondo e io sar per te unica al mondo
6749831 la mia vita monotona io do la caccia alle galline e gli uomini danno la caccia a me tutte le galline si assomigliano e tutti gli uomini si assomigliano e io mi annoio per ci ma se tu mi addomestichi la mia vita
6749832 ma non ho molto tempo per ho da scoprire degli amici e da conoscere molte cose
6749833 in principio tu ti sederai un po lontano da me cos nellerba io ti guarder con la coda dellocchio e tu non dirai nulla le parole sono una fonte di malintesi ma ogni giorno tu potrai sederti un po pi vicino
6749834 se tu vieni per esempio tutti i pomeriggi alle quattro dalle tre io comincer ad essere felice col passare dellora aumenter la mia felicit quando saranno le quattro incomincer ad agitarmi e ad inquietarmi scoprir il prezzo della felicit ma se tu vieni non si sa quando io non sapr mai a che ora prepararmi il cuore ci vogliono i riti
6749835 e quello che fa un giorno diverso dagli altri giorni unora dalle altre ore c un rito per esempio presso i miei cacciatori il gioved ballano con le ragazze del villaggio allora il gioved un giorno meraviglioso io mi spingo sino alla vigna se i cacciatori ballassero in un giorno qualsiasi i giorni si assomiglierebbero tutti e non avrei mai vacanza
6749836 io non ti volevo far del male ma tu hai voluto che ti addomesticassi
6749837 va a rivedere le rose capirai che la tua unica al mondo
6749838 voi non siete per niente simili alla mia rosa voi non siete ancora niente
6749839 nessuno vi ha addomesticato e voi non avete addomesticato nessuno voi siete come era la mia volpe non era che una volpe uguale a centomila altre ma ne ho fatto il mio amico e ne ho fatto per me unica al mondo
6749840 non si pu morire per voi certamente un qualsiasi passante crederebbe che la mia rosa vi rassomigli ma lei lei sola pi importante di tutte voi perch lei che ho innaffiata perch lei che ho messa sotto la campana di vetro perch lei che ho riparato col paravento perch su di lei ho ucciso i bruchi salvo due o tre per le farfalle perch lei che ho ascoltato lamentarsi o vantarsi o anche qualche volta tacere perch la mia rosa

6749849 an intellectual is someone who says a simple thing in a difficult way an artist is someone who says a difficult thing in a simple way
6749850 your way begins on the other side become the sky take an ax to the prison wall escape walk out like someone suddenly born into colour do it now
6749851 but the fact of the matter is that john mccain is offering more of the same
6749852 his top economic adviser said the other day that americans should stop complaining theyve become a nation of whiners
6749853 but then there was another interview this is yesterday same day where somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6749854 so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america and you dont have to be you dont have to be a nobel prize laureate economist you just have to have a little bit of a sense of what ordinary people are going through to understand that we cant afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the same failed economic policies that george bush has put in place
6749855 there have been recent episodes in which mccain has missed even the most basic facts about foreign policy during a recent
6749856 despite mccains multiple trips to iraq he still manages to mangle facts on the ground
6749857 mccain apparently is not even certain about iraqs geographic location
6749858 far worse than such embarrassing factual errors though have been his shockingly careless and at times tasteless and insensitive off the cuff comments on various topics
6749859 but that comment was well thought out compared to some others
6749860 at best the senator has a warped sense of humor but such gaffes also betray a disturbing lack of judgment
6749861 mccains record shows clearly that he is a verbal loose cannon and would be a clear and present danger in the oval office
6749862 politicians need a host of skills but there was one that the old john mccain was proud not to possess the ability to talk out of both sides of his mouth
6749863 on tuesday while perched on an oil rig in the gulf of mexico mccain proved that hes mastered that trick
6749864 it is time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this mccain said from the giant 10 000 barrel per day structure owned by chevron and exxon mobil
6749865 wont solve our problem hes wrong and the american people know it
6749866 unfortunately although many americans believe that offshore drilling will provide real relief from high energy prices its the new mccain whos wrong
6749867 those resources which would take years to develop would only postpone or temporarily relieve our dependency on fossil fuels
6749868 mccain assumed his partys thin green mantle with his focus on global warming and his support for a cap and trade system for carbon emissions but how green a president would mccain be judging by his senate career the answer is not very
6749869 the mccain campaign had also put out the story that mother teresa
6749870 more than 60 present and former telecom lobbyists work for mccains campaign as staffers and volunteers some in high echelon posts while on leave from their firms
6749871 first a mccain ad charged that obama was responsible for higher gas prices which was not just false but absurd
6749872 maybe by the time the democratic congress got done with it obamas tax program would look different
6749873 but when he resorts to these kinds of falsehoods and casts such aspersions on his opponents patriotism john mccain is no longer putting his country first if he were he would recognize that the interests of the nation require a relatively truthful campaign to fulfill his image of himself mccain should stop lying about his opponent for a man with his claims to honor and integrity thats not too much to ask

6749925 one of the most important things i look for when i evaluate a healing community and i think has that raw material is how well they provide the holistic care to their patients do you go past just the automatic reflexive life saving intervention you made on somebody to open a closed artery and make sure it doesnt happen again do you educate the community do you see each patient as part of an army that can go home and share the lessons youve shared with them so they can pass on the information and if we can do this intelligently we can build an america thats a lot healthier to live in

6749945 this it director sent in a support request saying that there must be a problem with their mail server because they keep getting bounces
6749946 we were able to convince him to send those bounce e mails so that they could be investigated there were about 10
6749947 i did get hold of the nondelivery report and it appeared as though the original mail was sent to a previously entered contact as opposed to having been typed in manually
6749948 i checked their company address list to see if it was in there somewhere and it wasnt
6749949 the only other place it would be would be a personal contact in his own mailbox that he typed there himself
6749950 he continues to insist that we need to fix something thankfully everyone at my company is standing behind me

6749954 the massive form of twisting geometric shapes and colours attracts just about everyone who sees it it is visually interesting and it becomes the centrepiece for meeting and conversation but that is not at the expense of the function of bloqx because of this harmony between form and function bloqx has initially been one of the most popular products we have ever shown to architects
6749955 when you reach the top it is the place to see and be seen and meet new friends
6749956 kompan was founded thirty five years ago by an artist who was inspired by children playing on his oversized colorful sculptures in a park bloqx is a perfect example that this approach is still very much at the heart of all of kompan products

6749958 in the promotional products industry we have a common saying that every promotional pen has an average of six users in its lifetime we had the idea to demonstrate the progression of passing a pen along from one person to the next much like the pop culture game six degrees of kevin bacon this is a highly effective way to show just how many impressions one promotional pen will have
6749959 if a client has 5 000 to spend on advertising they can either buy one page advertisement in the local paper or they can buy 5 000 writing instruments unlike the newspaper ad which will only appear in one edition the pens will be passed from user to user allowing the decorated message to live on for years to come to think of the number of people who see or use just one of those pens is staggering if as consumers we look in our desks in our purses or next to our home telephones well find a pen with someone elses name on it theres no reason it cant be your name on that pen
6749960 its incredibly satisfying when our voice solutions help a customer exceed their business goals
6749961 that iri nominated angel com for this award speaks volumes about their success with our ivr solution
6749962 the biggest benefit of the angel com ivr is the benefit of real time information
6749963 as reports in nigeria poured in from across the country we were immediately able to see what was happening throughout the region
6749964 the empowerment of sitebuilder is a great advantage for angel com and for iri
6749965 the user friendly and intuitive solution enabled me to easily create my own application the menu based platform lets me make changes quickly and theyre active almost instantly
6749966 we greatly value the ability for a non profit organization such as ours to leverage high level technology that truly helps make a difference
6749967 almost everyday there are news segments on the economy and a looming recession unemployment rates are at record highs and everyone around the country is feeling the effects of the poor economy some families are even struggling to meet basic living expenses such as food and transportation and therefore cant repay their owed back taxes these families are ideal candidates for what is known as placement on the irs currently not collectible status
6749968 each client owed on average approximately 48 000 00 with the highest single tax liability being nearly 480 000 00 most of the clients cases were successfully concluded within one year but it is important to remember that the amount of time it takes to negotiate a settlement with the irs depends on a variety of factors including how quickly the taxpayer can provide financial documents requested by the irs
6749969 i strongly encourage taxpayers struggling with irs back taxes to call my law firm
6749970 sometimes people do not realize that they have options the irs is willing to negotiate and even cease collections if you show them you cannot afford to fully repay your tax liability the lawyers at my law firm are skilled at negotiating with the irs and know how to get taxpayers the resolutions they deserve
6749971 i should not focus on june but on may and june together it shows that euro zone industry is in deep trouble by now

6749973 to help consumers quickly identify and locate their favorite entertainment and news programming on television and beyond
6749974 but it occurs to me that one broadcast network abc has in the last two or three years become so identified as a destination for cool smart young adults that it has gone and branded itself without necessarily attempting to do so
6749975 using a modular icon system that is tied to the abc logo the consumer oriented strategy simplifies navigation at many access points proving sic information to viewers in what has become an increasingly cluttered world of media this enhancement will give consumers a unique clear and consistent set of visual tools to help them find new additional content and information from one platform to the next

6749977 it was a good time for us to redo our deal so we can take the content to additional platforms
6749978 the fact is that the private system exists and like it or not it is here to stay
6749979 we need to accommodate it in order for the public system to prosper
6749980 we have one of the most costly and least efficient health systems of any industrialized country
6749981 its not for everyone its not all doctors who will go to the private side thats for sure and its not feasible everywhere
6749982 does it make sense in the face of a shortage of operating rooms to ban surgeons who provide 90 per cent of their services in a hospital from performing five to 10 per cent of their surgeries in a private clinic
6749983 i totally agree with dr ouellet that we need to do better but most of my patients cant afford to go to dr ouellets clinics
6749984 were going to have to find solutions that benefit everyone and not just people who can afford to pay
6749985 theres just no market outside of major cities for this kind of thing
6749986 they knew what brian day was doing they knew what im doing and they voted for us
6749987 weve always been highly in favour of a publicly funded system but i think we as an organization certainly have reached the stage where we realize there have to be alternatives because the system is not working
6749988 the wait times are totally unacceptable and there are shortages across the country especially in newfoundland the cracks are starting to show
6749989 the cma remains concerned that federal politicians are not addressing some of the key issues affecting health and health care

6749995 the state may have a more compelling interest in ensuring that fetuses carried to term do not suffer from debilitating injuries than it does in ensuring that any particular fetus is born
6749996 civil liability on mothers may be as likely to deter the carrying of pregnancies to term as to deter maternal negligence during pregnancy
6749997 expanded access to prenatal education and heath care facilities will far more likely serve the very real state interest in preventing increasing numbers of children from being born in to lives of pain and despair
