8610062 we reported an overall increase in revenue of 3 4 percent from the comparable quarter of the prior year however excluding the top line benefits provided by favorable foreign currency exchange rates our revenue declined 3 9 percent revenue from key new products most notably our sign making and specialty graphics segments wide format uv inkjet printer the solara ion tm and continued strong sales performance from our spandex distribution operations helped to mitigate the negative effects of significant market softness in our other primary businesses in comparison to the same quarter of the prior year our gross margin was impacted by lower production volumes and an unfavorable product mix the product mix in the first quarter reflected a significant drop in high margin software sales and a higher percentage of lower margin distribution sales due to the strong revenue growth of our spandex business which continues to outpace the growth of our higher margin manufacturing businesses combined these factors accounted for the 3 1 percentage point reduction in gross profit margin and lower net income compared with the first quarter of the prior year
8610063 this was a challenging quarter for the company we decided to act quickly and aggressively in response to the current market softness and as a result have already taken actions including the previously announced workforce reductions in early august 2008 in order to position us to continuously improve our operating margins although the current global economic outlook continues to be uncertain we anticipate that the success of new products and the cost reduction initiatives taken will allow us to deliver sustainable earnings growth in fiscal year 2009

8610221 placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts
8610222 i am sure that the united position of the sco member states will have international resonance
8610223 and i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression
8610224 we understand the complex history and realities of south ossetia and abkhazia
8610225 at the same time reflecting chinas consistent stance on such issues we hope all the parties can appropriately resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation
8610226 it was the most inspirational thing i have done at the convention
8610227 as you walk around town you cant help but see all the suits and the blackberries and the networking but these kids thats what its all about
8610228 i felt very educated about how we need to take care of our rivers the kids were terrific
8610229 as much as i want to go home its quite pointless as im not going to anything
8610230 so its not gonna change the people who have walked before have walked because they know on the outside its different and its going to help them

8610235 one of the people involved did the right thing and contacted a lawyer as we often ask then the lawyer did the right thing and called police

8610241 i am prepared to accept my churchs view i have to accept that on faith
8610242 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter
8610243 i ask catholics in this position to have the integrity to respect the eucharist catholic teaching and the catholic faithful
8610244 regarding the grave sin of abortion or euthanasia when a persons formal cooperation becomes manifest understood in the case of a catholic politician as his consistently campaigning and voting for permissive abortion and euthanasia laws his pastor should meet with him instructing him about the churchs teaching informing him that he is not to present himself for holy communion until he brings to an end the objective situation of sin and warning him that he will otherwise be denied the eucharist
8610245 if a catholic were to be at odds with the holy father on the application of capital punishment or on the decision to wage war he would not for that reason be considered unworthy to present himself to receive holy communion
8610246 while the church exhorts civil authorities to seek peace not war and to exercise discretion and mercy in imposing punishment on criminals it may still be permissible to take up arms to repel an aggressor or to have recourse to capital punishment there may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia

8610271 reducing health inequities is an ethical imperative social injustice is killing people on a grand scale
8610272 there is no good biological reason why this should be the case
8610273 these health inequalities are preventable they arise from the circumstances in which people are born grow live work and age the social determinants of health
8610274 taking action to deal with preventable causes of illness means taking social action a toxic combination of poor social policies unfair economic arrangements and bad politics is responsible
8610275 the commission considers health care a common good not a market commodity
8610276 the commission advocates financing the health care system through general taxation and or mandatory universal insurance the evidence is compellingly in favour of a publicly funded health care system
8610277 we are distressed by the reports we see of healthcare simply being unavailable to people because of inability to pay and we see that throughout lower and middle income countries
8610278 not for me to tell one of the richest countries on earth how it should organise its health care system
8610279 its not perhaps the best use of money thats being spent there are a lot of people who feel that and would actually like to see coming out of the current presidential campaign in the us proposals for a universal health insurance

8610284 gpl violations are often caused or compounded by a failure to adopt sound practices for the incorporation of gpld components into a companys internal development environment we suggest companies establish such practices before building a product based on gpld software
8610285 few redistributors compliance challenges relate directly to the copyleft provisions this is doubly true for most embedders instead the distributions of gpld systems that we encounter typically consist of a full operating system including components under the gpl e g linux busybox and components under the lgpl e g the gnu c library sometimes these programs have been patched or slightly improved by direct modification of their sources resulting unequivocally in a derivative work
8610286 companies often distribute fully independent proprietary programs developed from scratch which are designed to run on the foss operating system but do not combine with link to modify or otherwise derive from the gpld components in the latter case where the work is unquestionably a separate work of creative expression no derivative work has been created
8610287 too many software projects rely on only one or a very few team members who know how to build and assemble the final released product such knowledge centralization not only creates engineering redundancy issues but it also endangers gpl compliance which requires you to provide build scripts

8610326 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well

8610359 i think a lot more could be being done as opposed to just a hard edged enforcement around stop and search

8610361 not only did we flag up problems we flagged up solutions
8610362 you dont just wake up one morning and kill somebody
8610363 if you seek advice from a number of individuals who make recommendations and you do not put those in place that is a pretty challenging place to be
8610364 we gave some pretty good recommendations i think some of these need to find their way back to those who are responsible for taking decisions
8610365 we are working with schools education trying to tackle that sort of cultural its cool to carry a knife type dimension
8610366 if someone knows that theyre likely to be stopped and searched who is not a hardened criminal they will stop carrying weapons
8610367 stop and search is part of what were doing but were also sending a very visible message to young people that our aim is to keep them safe
8610368 weve had a huge amount of feedback from young people that it makes them safer to see us out on the streets
8610369 the more these indiscriminate searches take place the greater the risk of further alienating young people at a time when improving relations and co operation with the police is vital for community safety

8610376 we are tree workers we knock down trees for wood by beating them with these sticks sometimes a hundred people working round the clock can knock down a good sized tree in less than a month
8610377 that drawbaugh woman came to work this morning with a sharp piece of metal attached to the end of her stick she cut down a tree in less than an hour all by herself think of it such an outrageous threat to our traditional employment had to be stopped
8610378 allows people of all sizes and strengths to cut down trees wont that make it faster and cheaper to get wood and make things
8610379 how could anyone encourage an idea like that this noble work cant be done by any weakling who comes along with some new idea
8610380 these good tree workers have talented hands and brains they could use the time saved from knocking down trees to do other things they could make tables cabinets boats or even houses
8610381 the purpose of work is to have full and secure employment not new products

8610402 the nhs stop smoking service has a fantastic reputation for providing friendly free advice to anyone who wants help to give up smoking and it is very unfair that people are trying to trade off the back this success for their own personal gain

8610409 in the future we can look at these and other factors in women who quit smoking during pregnancy to assess who is at low or high risk of relapse
8610410 we can then offer more intensive interventions for those at higher risk to address the physical behavioral and social issues related to relapse
8610411 but more needs to be done because over 50 percent of women who quit the habit during pregnancy are smoking again at six months postpartum
8610412 many of the women who relapsed were already trying to quit again when we interviewed them
8610413 while there is no simple solution we recommend directly addressing the social and financial stresses that lead to relapse we hope that our study will encourage creative interventions to help mothers sustain a smoke free lifestyle after pregnancy improving overall health for women and their families

8610420 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8610421 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8610422 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8610423 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8610424 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8610427 were really seeing the standardization really resonating with a lot of customers
8610428 we liken it to whats happened in it where companies have gone to standardized operating environments in their software
8610429 you want the data centers to be designed and operated so that you know youll have a similar environment in your data centers in different places
8610430 it becomes less complex because youre using the same standard operating environment its much easier than if everything is one off were seeing the desire to adapt to change and to the global environment

8610442 both clintons went the extra mile and with class threw their full hearted support behind barack obama they put party and ideals above their personal feelings now lets see what barack obama does for them will he call off the african americans who falsely and unfairly branded the former president of the united states a racist will he personally dispel that lie will he support hillary clinton in her life long quest to make sure that every american has full access to quality afforable health care the one thing that barack obama hasnt shown the women of the party who support hillary clinton is that they matter to him for anything but votes
8610443 any democrat who votes for mccain should have their head examined the only possible reason has to be latent racism

8610452 solo una collaborazione pi costante tra i discografici e la tv pu portare i talent show a diventare importanti collettori di attenzione su personaggi nuovi e fare in modo che nascano talenti veri questi fenomeni sono reali la tv crea attenzione e con questi programmi abbiamo assistito a un ritorno degli interpreti

8610478 other researchers have suggested in the past that nk cells might not always be good for you but we now have the first direct evidence that this can actually be the case although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximize their beneficial role
8610479 while we acknowledge that prime minister rudds speech at the national press club today had education as its core message we were very disappointed that he made absolutely no mention of the urgent need to fix the rural health crisis in this country a crisis which is so very badly affecting the health outcomes and life expectancies of rural australians
8610480 in fact the last time we really heard the prime minister talking about the need to improve access to healthcare in the bush was soon after last years election
8610481 we are extremely disappointed that rural health seems to have dropped off the governments agenda any action we had hoped for in this critical area has been bogged down in a process of reviews many of which will continue on for another year
8610482 the governments own rural workforce audit released earlier this year confirmed the urgent need to get more doctors nurses and other health professionals into rural and remote australia
8610483 meanwhile we continue to see new reports released regularly which underline the much poorer health outcomes for rural and remote australians compared with those living in the cities
8610484 for example a report released just last week by the australian institute of health and welfare
8610485 it is not only cancer survival where rural and remote australians continue to be worse a long list of health outcomes for which rural australians are severely disadvantaged
8610486 there is no clear evidence that positive or negative experiences can affect breast cancer risk emotional stress is highly subjective and is difficult to measure accurately
8610487 women in this study were interviewed after breast cancer was diagnosed when they may be more likely to recall feeling depression and anxiety the researchers also didnt account for other factors known to affect breast cancer risk such as family history or weight
8610488 breast cancer is a complex disease and there is unlikely to be one single cause
8610489 todays report showing that 45 million americans are uninsured highlights a critical social and economic challenge that the nation must address while the census bureau reports a modest decline in the uninsured rate this does not reduce the urgency of the crisis over the past two years our community has put forth a series of proposals to cover the uninsured improve quality and reduce skyrocketing health care costs we need coverage for all americans coverage they can afford and coverage they can keep

8610495 the recent big increase in young medical graduates is placing enormous demand on intern training capacity in hospitals general practices and other facilities
8610496 it is also increasing the need for additional clinical placements for medical students and general practice training places for gp registrars
8610497 to help combat this rural and remote general practices should be receiving substantially greater funding support from the federal government to enable them to assist significantly in meeting the increased demand for medical training
8610498 in its submission to the national health and hospitals reform commission nhhrc and as reported in the sydney morning herald on tuesday the nsw medical student council argued that the number of medical student places in australia should not be increased further at least without significant investment and planning
8610499 rdaa agrees that there must be much better resourcing of intern training but we disagree strongly that medical student places should be frozen australia cannot afford to slam the brakes on future increases in medical student places given our desperate need for doctors
8610500 the only way forward is for the federal government to continue to increase medical student places in line with need while urgently putting in place substantially more financial support to meet the increased demand for intern training medical student placements and gp registrar placements
8610501 this includes better supporting rural and remote general practices so they can take on more of the medical student intern and registrar training load as these practices are currently significantly under utilised when it comes to providing teaching and training services
8610502 we are pleased to see the nsw medical student council recommend in its submission to the nhhrc that rural clinical schools should be considered for an expanded role in medical training given they are popular training places for medical students provide greater exposure to patients and procedures provide a favourable clinician tostudent ratio and can really help entice medical students to seriously consider a career in rural medicine
8610503 while there is significant potential for general practices across rural and remote australia to train more medical students new medical graduates and gp registrars including in procedural medicine until they are properly supported to take on this task the number of teaching general practices will not increase significantly
8610504 at the end of the day it costs a lot of money for a practice to accommodate and train a medical student intern or registrar rural practices should not have to take on this financial burden
8610505 there is also a desperate need for the federal government to increase post graduate gp training places from around 600 places annually to at least 1200 places annually and to reinstate federal funding for the prevocational general practice placements program pgppp to at least its funding levels prior to the rudd governments significant budget cuts to this program
8610506 at the end of the day freezing any further increase in medical student places will not solve the number one problem facing rural and remote australia the desperate shortage of doctors
8610507 the situation is so bad that patients in many rural communities are now facing up to 300 kilometre round trips and up to 6 week waits just to see a doctor for a basic consultation
8610508 given this we are pleased to see tuesdays edition of
8610509 this pattern of associations with earlier age of nonmelanoma skin cancer diagnosis being linked more strongly to the risk of developing subsequent malignancies is consistent with the pattern that one would expect for a marker of inherited predisposition to cancer

8610543 in the future we can look at these and other factors in women who quit smoking during pregnancy to assess who is at low or high risk of relapse
8610544 we can then offer more intensive interventions for those at higher risk to address the physical behavioral and social issues related to relapse
8610545 but more needs to be done because over 50 percent of women who quit the habit during pregnancy are smoking again at six months postpartum
8610546 many of the women who relapsed were already trying to quit again when we interviewed them
8610547 while there is no simple solution we recommend directly addressing the social and financial stresses that lead to relapse we hope that our study will encourage creative interventions to help mothers sustain a smoke free lifestyle after

8610556 further study of the arid4 gene family may advance our understanding of the connection between gene regulation epigenetic control disease development and cancer formation
8610557 we also suggest that gene regulation by the arid4a and arid4b should be examined for potential disease related roles not only in human malignancies but also in other complex disease traits
8610558 our findings suggest that individuals presenting with features of inherited rcc susceptibility should be screened for germ line sdhb mutations because surveillance for sdhb related tumors can then be offered to mutation positive patients and relatives
8610559 it is entirely appropriate at this time to counsel patients carrying sdhb mutations espe cially those with arg mutations that they have a small but finite likelihood of developing rcc

8610594 governance in orissa state appears to have disintegrated some people have called the violence hindu christian clashes but this is not accurate innocent christians mostly of dalit origin continue to be attacked by communal organisations which are mocking the rule of law

8610596 we expect the final wpi inflation to peak in oct nov at around 13 5 14 0 per cent but to stay in double digit territory until february 2009 based on our forecast of slower gdp growth of 7 3 per cent in fy09 our energy teams forecast of the price of oil falling sharply to 90 bbl in q1 2009 plus favorable base effects our forecast is that wpi inflation will start turning down decisively in january 2009

8610633 please wait for two or three days for the chairman to come back and make an announcement
8610634 dont read ananda bazaar patrika and sambad pratidin newspapers and dont watch star ananda and chobis ghanta news channels they are slaves of the communist party of india marxist cpi m and are trying to mislead people with their fake reports against us and our movement
8610635 we know how the media creates news they bribed the police stopped 20 trucks on the highway took photos and said we have blocked the national highway 2 for our agitation the truth is we are sitting quite some distance away from the highway but so many people are coming to join our movement that they have to stand on the highway due to lack of space
8610636 one of the directors of a newspaper came to me a few days back and offered me a huge sum of money to withdraw my movement i told him that i have never deceived people and will never do so maybe i lack money power but i have manpower the support of common people
8610637 these channels and newspapers pretend to be the voice of the people all they care for are advertisements from the tata group and bribes in the form of land and money from cpi m
8610638 there is no room for flexibility on the issue of the judiciary there was no room for flexibility on the impeachment of the president and there is no room for flexibility on something that we have signed together something on which we have given a solemn pledge to each other
8610639 when you have an agenda to strengthen democracy and make parliament sovereign then how can you be flexible
8610640 if you recall even benazir bhutto stated that she wanted chaudhry reinstated as the chief justice of pakistan and to see the flag flying at his house
8610641 it is incumbent on the party and its leadership to implement what she said
8610642 the ppp government seems to be still following the agenda of the dictator pervez musharraf it is tragic that the ppp led by asif ali zardari seems to be an extension of the same system
8610643 under the present arrangement the president is more powerful than the prime minister we wanted to change all this we want to go back to the parliamentary form of government and powers of parliament and prime minister restored
8610644 only those powers should stay with the president as are bestowed by the constitution
8610645 it has boiled down to power in this process they have forgotten democracy
8610646 the school initially didnt tell us that she has fallen from the fifth floor we came to know about it later she was not someone who would commit suicide
8610647 we want a thorough investigation into the case by the central bureau of investigation the truth should come out we have also requested the police to take us to her room in the hostel
8610648 she was competing with herself she may have been stressed due to studies she had scored less in two monday tests
8610649 she got 26 marks out of 40 in her english test and because of that she may have been depressed according to her classmates she was very studious and was always occupied with books
8610650 let the police probe the matter the school is shocked and sad
8610651 the case is still open and we are waiting for the postmortem report before the investigations are taken forward and we come to any conclusion
8610652 bhattacharjee is the only person responsible for the singur impasse the state government completed the entire procedure of land acquisition in a hurry and thus the situation deteriorated
8610653 we have decided to hold a meeting aug 30 and after that we would disclose our stand on singur in west bengal in the meeting we would review the present situation there
8610654 buddhadeb will have to do everything on his own to resolve the issue
8610655 these excellent results reflect the great strides bahrain has made towards modernising and liberalising our economy and training and educating our native workforce
8610656 businesses operating in bahrain are capitalising on the availability of the most highly skilled native workforce in the region
8610657 the attendance of contractual labourers has fallen further the constant decline in their attendance following increasing threats is sure to affect the deadlines of the project
8610658 there were a couple of cases in singur where an employee was verbally threatened and another was slapped by the agitators
8610659 but there has been no incident today in the morning around 40 45 vehicles with tata motors employees entered the project site
8610660 strategically these air attacks cannot change the current military balance of course it creates some sort of psychological effect but nothing drastically

8610663 the patients who come to us tend to come to us with complex illnesses like cancers requiring major surgeries so on and so forth and that in a way has improved our revenue intensity on a per patient basis
8610664 i think if we open up at least the across the board staff could be easily filled up as against now relying on locals and some locals are not keen to take up these jobs
8610665 the nine inside the secret world of the supreme court
8610666 too close to call the 36 day battle to decide the 2000 election
8610667 this election is really about issues that will affect the lives of every american and the world
8610668 women are discriminated against widely for a variety of reasons and until those reasons are addressed the problem will remain for instance look at the laws such as the inheritance law property law and land and land units law they are all biased towards men
8610669 the idea behind this initiative is to use the religious sentiment to make people change their mindset against the girl child where laws have failed to curb the heinous crime of female foeticide this sentiment will hopefully work
8610670 until laws which are biased towards men are not changed it will be difficult to change the negative trend of female foeticide
8610671 however until that happens we will continue our endeavour to do something for the cause the priests in the gurudwara will also encourage people to present a sapling when a girl child is born and to a new bride when she enters her husbands home for the first time to signify a new beginning

8610677 i want to get young people everywhere engaged and active and really questioning
8610678 what right do older generations have to jeopardize our future
8610679 we wanted to kick off in the most effective way possible and unite kids from all over the place
8610680 i always wanted to do something for the environment but i didnt know what to do
8610681 there are videos of 90 year old people being intimidated at caucuses
8610682 this is a hijacked nomination and we know who hijacked it
8610683 they picked him they wanted him and they wanted hillary out
8610684 with all the illegalities that went on in the caucuses
8610685 even though hillary said to throw our support to him that is not going to do it
8610686 some smart professional women have really drunk the kool aid
8610687 its starting to lose any intellectual credibility particularly when you consider what is at stake
8610688 the same thing i regularly tell the democrats who went with ralph nader instead of al gore its not the 535 votes in florida that cost al gore it was the 97 000 votes nader got there
8610689 the way to influence behavior like that is to first raise peoples level of consciousness
8610690 i would probably go in and say were all trying to conserve energy pasadena is a very green city so it would be best if you didnt pour your air conditioning into the outside world and i might say that im not inclined to shop in a place that hasnt caught on to the green spirit of pasadena
8610691 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8610692 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8610693 young men are less likely to be joiners if theyre engaged theyre happy if theyre happy they stay
8610694 if there could possibly be a thing as electronica unplugged then future chaos might be it
8610695 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
8610696 its a disappointing and vulgar attack on john mccain who has devoted his life to the cause of freedom and the fight against tyranny
8610697 some materials may irritate sensitive skin please look at the materials if you believe this may be the case
8610698 his experience his tactical and technical capabilities will help us greatly
8610699 hes not just the top manager in europe hes top of the world
8610700 you cant work at that level and stay with one club for so long if you do not have exceptional qualities it is so difficult
8610701 so for me he is the best manager in the world and the one everyone else has to look up to
8610702 i know sir alex but i havent played against him so i am looking forward to the game which i know will be very difficult
8610703 he is with us but i will see tomorrow if he plays or not i have not yet made up my mind
8610704 what confuses me is how the malware made it as far as the astronauts in the first place surely it should be possible to scan computers and storage devices before they are carried on the shuttle up to the space station in orbit
8610705 we believe in him thats why we brought him tot he club we protect our players miro knows he can rely on us
8610706 i would recommend that he fights and works hard just as gerd mueller did in such situations miro has to play better of course we all agree on that he has to confirm himself on the field
8610707 i knew that hoffenheim would be stronger than a normal newly promoted team and i did not expect it to be so strong

8610710 mccain is at more of a high water mark than we are
8610711 we look at places where we can adjust the electorate
8610712 is to make african american turnout the highest in history
8610713 we will have the turnout advantage and we like who the undecideds are
8610714 is mccain going to replicate what bush did in ohio if he does we think hell lose he has to do better than 2004

8610723 i am very surprised and humbled by this honor thank you for remembering me
8610724 that was a very good team with several big leaguers on it i remember playing with luis castillo and kevin millar and the great seasons that they had we had a great season and finished first that year i wish we could have beaten
8610725 this is totally unexpected and a pleasant surprise i knew bob ganley very well and to be included in the sea dogs hall of fame with bob and carlos tosca and fredi gonzalez and some of the wonderful players in sea dogs history is terrific i cant tell you how happy i am about this

8610727 the association between magnesium sulfate and a lower incidence of cerebral palsy has biologic plausibility because magnesium stabilizes blood vessels protects against damage from oxygen depletion and protects against injury from swelling and inflammation all of which threaten the vulnerable preterm brain
8610728 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to evaluate the effect of magnesium sulfate on the incidence of cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8610729 it hurts my sleep but ill be lying in bed thinking what is the reaction to this what is the reaction if i do that i think about these things constantly
8610730 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver for whom will you vote this is the kind of question that i predict and this has nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at five 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent

8610737 i am pleased with the companys quarterly topline performance driven by strong volume primarily in consumer products as well as effective pricing actions and successful new product sales
8610738 however our businesses continue to be negatively impacted by inflationary costs pressures which further accelerated during the first quarter
8610739 combating cost increases through pricing actions and productivity gains remains a critical priority and we believe we are on track to offset costs in the back half of fiscal 2009
8610740 provided clear evidence expeditors has been unable to buck the trend of slowing seen at forwarders and express carriers
8610741 we were able to achieve sustained and rapid development across various business lines in the first half of the year
8610742 we expect various financial risk factors and economic uncertainties to increase putting considerable pressure on the management of our banks operations
8610743 for the most part recreate 68 has been a dismal failure this particular event which i was there to cover as a blogger turned out to be a failure and so opportunists seized the day and tried to make news out of it by attacking the media
8610744 can we regulate what they eat off school property of course not and can we even monitor their lunch box no and we dont intend to we can be leaders by example to say heres a healthy choice that you can and should make and we hope also that parents will be inspired to think about that when they make choices for their children
8610745 it seemed egregious that there is this recent and ongoing relationship between obama and ayers a strange and in many ways disreputable figure
8610746 the idea of running to the justice department demanding prosecution its really beyond the pale it smacks of a kind of desperation about the issue that we didnt expect
8610747 if you reduce uric acid at least in some patients you may be able to reduce blood pressure
8610748 this could be one way people develop hypertension and may allow us to develop new therapies
8610749 this is far from being a reasonable therapeutic intervention for high blood pressure but these findings indicate a first step in understanding the pathway of the disease
8610750 you cannot prevent a disease until you know the cause this study is way of finding that out
8610751 the antihypertensive therapies available to patients are well proven and safe
8610752 currently available antihyperuricemic therapies treatments that lower uric acid are not safe enough to be used as first line therapy for most people with high blood pressure
8610753 a device that measures cancer specific gases in exhaled breath would change medical research as we know it
8610754 improved methods to detect molecules have been demonstrated and more people need to be using these methods to detect molecules given off from cancer we have developed laser based methods to detect molecules mid infrared lasers can measure suspected cancer biomarkers ethane formaldehyde and acetaldehyde
8610755 you often have to go outside your discipline to pioneer new areas of research and oklahoma has an advantage with so many experts in other fields but getting funding for interdisciplinary research is challenging however more capital and research infrastructure are needed for this device to become a reality as we build upon our existing capabilities oklahoma can become more widely known as a center of excellence in this important area
8610756 the science supports it and the dogs tell us there is something there
8610757 gustav se ha estado desplazando al suroeste rumbo al sur de jamaica seg n ha sido observado por el radar de la gran piedra santiago de cuba y confirmado por un avi n de reconocimiento
8610758 disminuye considerablemente cualquier posibilidad de afectaci n a las provincias orientales de cuba
8610759 durante las pr ximas 12 a 24 horas se estima que gustav se desplace con rumbo pr ximo al oeste a unos 13 kil metros por hora bordeando la costa sur de jamaica posteriormente su movimiento se inclinar al oeste noroeste

8610765 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
8610766 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
8610767 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8610768 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8610769 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
8610770 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8610771 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8610772 how many events do you think i should be working
8610773 well you know we had a long primary season which means that a lot of stuff was backed up
8610774 which means that ive got to still do work preparing for thursday night
8610775 people know that i can give the kind of speech that i gave four years ago
8610776 theyre more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives so in that sense i think this is going to be a more workmanlike speech im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families
8610777 the better off this campaign is going to be because i think i can make the case im the right choice for them thats what i want to spend my time doing
8610778 i was surprised given the convention but i think its great hes here
8610779 seems to know what were thinking what we need hes not one of those multimillionaire guys
8610780 we have walked out because they have refused to respond many mps requested a select committee to be formed but the minister home minister syed hamid albar refused
8610781 there is no point staying and participating in the debate
8610782 they walked out contrary to the rules because they dont want to accept defeat they know that they will be defeated
8610783 they walked out because they dont want it to appear like a failure for its leader who has said that he will be able to win over barisan nasional mps
8610784 the prime minister has lost the mandate of the country and the nation
8610785 there is no threat from anwar he has won in a by election and he becomes just another mp
8610786 well they ought to do this they ought to do that
8610787 i agree with so many of you but particularly with
8610788 tell this headline to every uneducated person from a third world or
8610789 let this limited children initiative start with the third world countries and the islamic families that are currently trying to out produce the rest of us in order to take over
8610790 i wish i had know this before we had three
8610791 as usual another bible thumper that cannot offer proof to back up his beliefs
8610792 to muttonhead31 since you asked i will respond by repeating myself look around you
8610793 that mountain is not really there everyone is just imagining it
8610794 mixdown it is not a personal attack it is math
8610795 to mixdown you believe there is a god and thats what this country is all about but show me the proof that u speak of
8610796 about the argument over being frugal with resources in having more than two kids
8610797 to the jackal if you cant find proof that god exists then you are blind
8610798 wowsers this from scientists that are generally left of center politically and all in favor of the usa becoming north mexico in a few years
8610799 i recently saw a item on this on pbs and was shocked at how soon this is goign to become a global problem
8610800 i cant believe that people get so up in arms about the suggestion that they not have huge families i have chosen not to have kids and am regularly attacked for the decision by people who do choose to have them
8610801 charlie hustle you should run for president on that platform
8610802 in america we have generations of welfare recipients who beleive the more kids you have the more the government will reward you so why would they ever stop having children besides how else would the women be able to buy those new 24
8610803 i myself have only two children but i resent the premise of these arguments
8610804 it is about time someone took this thought process public in a more aggressive manner
8610805 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
8610806 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
8610807 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
8610808 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
8610809 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
8610810 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt
8610811 point 4 the palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly and the israelis cease acting like jerks
8610812 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
8610813 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
8610814 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
8610815 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
8610816 if they asked me id say spend your time in ohio or some of these other states where its going to be very close
8610817 and they shall make an ark of shittim wood two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof and a cubit and a half the height thereof and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold within and without shalt thou overlay it and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about

8610822 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8610823 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8610824 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics

8610841 it feels like you are part of a film that is actually happening
8610842 at times i have to pinch myself and say this is real shes actually doing this
8610843 my husband and i often said goodbye by making love
8610844 but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him but it was just the best way to go
8610845 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift

8610858 saya dengan kantor wakil presiden sudah memfasilitasi pertemuan konsorsium dengan pln membahas masalah ini
8610859 jika ini yang terjadi memang ada potensi pltp sarulla kembali ditinggalkan pengembang kalau pembicaraan soal negosiasi harga jual listrik ini tak menemui titik temu sangat mungkin konsorsium medco itochu dan ormat tak meneruskan pembangunan pltp sarulla dan memilih kembali menjual proyek ini

8610875 this was a huge huge win for us simply because of the way we lost last night
8610876 we couldve afforded to lose but the way we lost last night you never know where thats going to lead you
8610877 when he hits we simply win because he just carries us
8610878 it shows that we have a lot of character and a lot of guys with short term memories
8610879 we were able to put tuesday night behind us and come back and play thats important
8610880 hes a good young hitter i never thought about pinch hitting for him or anything like that hes a big part of what were doing
8610881 when youre scuffling you just try to feel that swing easley told him
8610882 then what you do is you just try to unhook that train youve been dragging for along the whole time
8610883 i cant believe were finally able to leave for medical treatment
8610884 i missed the start of the berlin wall coming down by just a few days but now i know how people felt when they tore down those first few bricks this has been a huge victory of people over power

8610886 weve taken a unit of work and linked it all together
8610887 our aim is to make it make fun engaging and educational
8610888 my favourite experiment was the hovercraft where you use a balloon with a cd and they spin
8610889 our class has actually been doing science for some time
8610890 you have to sticky tape metal to metal and then the lights comes on like this
8610891 it really lets the kids construct their own understanding and age is no barrier to what they can do
8610892 its kids teaching kids and how to learn in kids language
8610893 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
8610894 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
8610895 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
8610896 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
8610897 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
8610898 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
8610899 with people who have a lot of gifts its hard for people to identify with them
8610900 barack obama is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8610901 there are so many things about our candidate that are different that the challenge that we have is to give people a confidence that despite all these things that feel different okay i get what hes about personally that his family is like every other family that your kids go to school with
8610902 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8610903 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8610904 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8610905 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8610906 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8610907 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8610908 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8610909 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8610910 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8610911 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8610912 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8610913 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8610914 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8610915 i went to philadelphia and all i got was shit for not attending the conference they sent me to
8610916 the long answer is well ive lived in the philly area for most of my life and i know it well maybe too well so i figure nows my chance to get to know somewhere else l a is sunny and theres good vegetarian food
8610917 not only because people seemed to really appreciate it but because talking to farmers was like some kind of therapy so nice and relaxing made me want to quit journalism and become a farmer
8610918 im hoping california is like one big headhouse market everywhere you look fruits and veggies even if its not that way im going to have a little yard out there and i plan to start a garden so i will send you a tomato and you can decide
8610919 the next six months are going to tell the story
8610920 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8610921 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8610922 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8610923 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8610924 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8610925 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8610926 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8610927 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8610928 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
8610929 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
8610930 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
8610931 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
8610932 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
8610933 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
8610934 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
8610935 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
8610936 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
8610937 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
8610938 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
8610939 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
8610940 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8610941 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8610942 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8610943 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8610944 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8610945 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8610946 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8610947 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8610948 if george w bush was seeking re election wed be 20 points ahead
8610949 in arizona the only way to get around is by small private plane
8610950 we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states
8610951 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8610952 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8610953 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8610954 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8610955 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8610956 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8610957 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8610958 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8610959 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8610960 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8610961 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8610962 kami meminta pihak kpu tidak bertele tele dan tidak berbuat adil terhadap calon independen pihak kami jangan dipersulit dengan adanya surat suara yang hilang dan kami meminta seluruh berkas dukungan diserahkan pada kami

8610967 most of the people living in this area are squatters
8610968 most of the violence has been directed at mexico residents who are involved in drugs and there have not been many incidents involving innocent people or americans
8610969 however the danger is there over 800 persons have been killed so far this year
8610970 we have about 40 families in the colonia that are regularly involved in the mission it is reportedly the second largest church in the area of juarez
8610971 one of the most impressive things that is happening is that the colonia families save some of the food that is donated to take to families who are more needy
8610972 theres been a big change a revolution is going on in this area
8610973 everywhere we go people want to know who we are where we came from we are the veterans iraq war veterans antiwar veterans pissed off veterans
8610974 hey hey uncle sam we remember vietnam we dont want your iraq war peace is what were marching for
8610975 look at al the barriers everywhere they spent 15 million on them just so people like the iraq veterans against the war couldnt deliver a very diplomatically written letter to barack obama
8610976 that someone will throw a pie at nancy pelosi for being so spineless

8610980 we are extremely excited at the prospect of bringing beach polo back to poole
8610981 sandbanks fabulous beach is a great venue and we are very happy to be staging the championships in poole until 2013
8610982 this years event attracted a lot of local interest and promoted sandbanks and poole on the national stage
8610983 we hope the event goes from strength to strength over the next five years
8610984 friends and family of the deceased should not be expected to opt out from attending their loved ones funeral or burial service
8610985 nor can funeral attendees simply avert their eyes to avoid exposure to disruptive speech at a funeral or burial service the mere presence of a protestor is sufficient to inflict the harm
8610986 dr kings 1963 words yet ring powerful and prophetic 40 years after his voice was tragically silenced in 1968
8610987 the power of the words lies in their hopeful urgency
8610988 one of the criteria not being accepted in his own land marks the response of many christians and sad to say many baptist christians to king
8610989 that of putting history and the future into perspective as a key to understanding the
8610990 far too many people who quote king had no sympathy or commitment to his cause either in 1963 or 1968
8610991 far too many people including too many leaders in business religious life government and in neighborhoods quote dr kings 1963 words as if they were his last about racial justice
8610992 like anybody i would like to live a long life longevity has its place but im not concerned about that now i just want to do gods will and hes allowed me to go up to the mountain and ive looked over and ive seen the promised land i may not get there with you but i want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land
8610993 if we are serious about developing the tactics and strategies to bring about real change after the election we have to first know if barack obama is even with us
8610994 oh no we cant spend any money for training or spend money for development tools or technology platforms or anything different than free

8611006 our special teams practices are just as hard as our regular practice and it was a little bit of a shock when i first got here
8611007 i played special teams in college but we never practiced it much
8611008 i think coach reid does a great job of putting emphasis on special teams
8611009 we have the first meeting of the day every morning and even at training camp the first meeting at night is special teams those last about 40 minutes
8611010 kickoff return for example some teams use a three man wedge and some teams use a four man wedge a lot of that has to do with your returner and the kinds of schemes you run off that
8611011 a lot of four man wedge teams are clearly a middle wedge and outside directional wedge concept where its more of a downhill running back who breaks tackles a three man wedge is a little more versatile where you can set double teams at the point of attack

8611013 the arrest of kevin cogill is great for the recording industry related to our online investigations we are very pleased with the fbis interest and the u s attorneys offices aggressiveness in pursuing this investigation
8611014 we think well see more and more of these pre release cases
8611015 i always said that the more that axl and geffen jerked around trying to figure out how to release this finally finished album that weve all been waiting over 13 years for the greater the chances would be that it would slip out of a pressing plant or office somewhere and wind up in the hands of some asshole with a blog
8611016 so remember when we let you guys listen to some allegedly ha new guns n roses songs we got our hands on
8611017 well either way the fbi sure does theyve been investigating and talking to me about that event ever since if there are any lawyers out there horny for some high profile copyright law battle drop us a line
8611018 in the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine
8611019 youre trying to give them a realistic look at what they can expect in a game
8611020 probably the biggest thing is doing it fast and at full speed
8611021 thats been my role the last three years and i want to do it the best i can
8611022 they told me when we played the patriots to just be real physical with the cornerbacks and safeties
8611023 they told me to be almost overly physical maybe even trying to get away with offensive pass interference like he does
8611024 we must talk and make clear to iran that it must change
8611025 hey look barack obamas plan is the same as george bushs
8611026 its a little too early to tell what the trends are
8611027 it is the worst proposal i have ever gotten from management very very severe and very very anti union

8611030 great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds
8611031 an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last
8611032 affirmative action is something the good dont need and the bad dont deserve
8611033 the men who create power make an indispensable contribution to the nations greatness but the men who question power make a contribution just as indispensable especially when that questioning is disinterested for they determine whether we use power or power uses us
8611034 the problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities we need men who can dream of things that never were
8611035 i love america more than any other country in this world and exactly for this reason i insist on the right to criticize her perpetually
8611036 hold fast to dreams for if dreams die life is but a broken winged bird that cannot fly
8611037 attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference
8611038 dreams are true while they last and do we not live in dreams
8611039 nothing in the world can take the place of persistence
8611040 never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake
8611041 for evil to triumph it is only necessary for good men to do nothing
8611042 war begins in the minds of men and it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must first be constructed
8611043 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders the country is the real thing the substantial thing the eternal thing it is the thing to watch over and care for and be loyal to institutions are extraneous they are its mere clothing and clothing can wear out become ragged cease to be comfortable cease to protect the body from winter disease and death
8611044 patriotism is to support your country all the time and your government when it deserves it
8611045 the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man
8611046 the power of accurate observation is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it
8611047 democracy is a system ensuring that the people are governed no better than they deserve
8611048 if we dont believe in freedom of expression for people we despise we dont believe in it at all
8611049 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
8611050 when the people fear the government you have tyranny when the government fears the people you have freedom
8611051 they were democrats through and through mostly catholics struggling to square their church with their party and they were encouraged by the pro life language that for the first time made its way into the party platform to be adopted at this weeks convention if they can somehow square that circle it truly would be a monumental achievement

8611077 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8611078 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8611079 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8611080 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8611081 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8611082 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8611083 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8611084 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8611085 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8611086 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8611087 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8611088 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8611089 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8611090 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8611091 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8611092 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8611093 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8611094 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8611095 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8611096 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8611097 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8611098 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8611099 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8611100 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8611101 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8611102 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8611103 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8611104 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8611105 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8611106 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8611107 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8611108 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8611109 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8611110 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8611111 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8611112 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8611113 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8611114 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8611115 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8611116 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8611117 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8611118 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8611119 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8611120 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8611121 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8611122 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8611123 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8611124 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8611125 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8611126 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8611127 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8611128 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants

8611143 fixing the criminal justice system is obviously an important goal for any society yet we realise that it alone will not make us a safe society and that unless we significantly reduce the demand on the criminal justice system it will never be able to deliver justice for all
8611144 we recognise the need for a practical and an achievable vision of a safe south africa a vision that encapsulates an ideal safe society
8611145 we know that realising this ideal will be a lengthy process and commit to working innovatively cleverly and with resilience to realise the capacity funding and structures to achieve this

8611154 short term precipitation deficits as much as 6 inches over the past 60 days also continued to grow across large parts of minnesota and wisconsin thirty day precipitation totals less than 25 of average and 7 to 28 day usgs streamflow below the 10th percentile led to an expansion of d0 and d1a conditions reflecting the deteriorating conditions an area of moderate d1a drought was established in northeastern wisconsin and along the border of the upper peninsula of michigan and the arrowhead of minnesota areas affected by moderate d1a drought also expanded southeastward from the twin cities and in northern minnesota in the area of the headwaters of the mississippi river

8611192 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8611193 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8611194 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8611195 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8611196 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken

8611202 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8611203 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8611204 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified

8611225 the department proposes to define abortion as any of the various procedures including the prescription and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
8611226 this definition would allow health care corporations or individuals to classify many common forms of contraception including the birth control pill emergency contraception and iuds abortions and therefore to refuse to provide contraception to women who need it

8611230 isnt it far fetched district authorities blaming a particular outfit within minutes of arriving at a crime scene
8611231 in december 2007 the area witnesses some of the bloodiest violence orissa has even seen after the swami was attacked by christians the state might have wanted to avert a repeat of the communal clashes and therefore could have pinned the blame on the maoists
8611232 elections are coming in a matter of months the state has failed miserably in tackling the maoist insurgency a government that has been terrorised by the maoists may in turn be trying to terrorise the people in the name of the maoists
8611233 the central committee authorises the killings and the outfit issues statements owning up to the murders they commit so many days after the murder there has been no statement from the maoists
8611234 the five attackers who the locals caught and handed over to the police are not maoists they are from the region
8611235 moreover i see no reason why the maoists will spare the policemen on duty
8611236 they see themselves as revolutionaries they never care about whether they are seen or not in fact i would say they would very much want to be seen
8611237 chances are very less he was working for the welfare of the tribal people and against forced conversions in the region there is nothing that suggests the maoists would see him as a class enemy
8611238 one day last year i was talking to the swami on phone and that time there was a lot of concern about his security so he said dont you people worry the maoists are not a threat to me in fact some of them are here with me
8611239 the best way this could be phrased is we do not rule out the involvement of the maoists
8611240 after the december 2007 clashes even the hindu outfits agreed that the maoists are working in tandem with militant christian outfits
8611241 a lot of maoists were converts to christianity and were involved in the december violence but this attack does not look like their work
8611242 there is a high possibility that this is the handiwork of militant christian outfits how they got such sophisticated weapons is something for the government to figure out
8611243 the governments responsibility to bring those responsible to book increases when you take into account the fact that the swami received an anonymous threat only a week before he was killed the local sp did not even register a case after the swami lodged a formal complaint they have to answer a lot of questions or this issue will snowball into a bigger issue than the december violence

8611268 diese noch nicht gekl rten punkte k nnen ein zusammengehen von dresdner bank und commerzbank durchaus noch zum scheitern bringen
8611269 eine einigung mit der commerzbank macht f r die allianz am meisten sinn da sie bei einer fusionierten bank ihre versicherungen ber mehr bankschalter verkaufen k nnte
8611270 wenn eine chinesische bank die mehrheit h lt bedeutet das zwar f r die allianz die chance einen st rkeren zugang zu dem chinesischen markt zu haben aber gleichzeitig ginge damit auch die gefahr einher die kontrolle zu verlieren
8611271 dies w re bei einer einigung mit der commerzbank ganz anders

8611287 nach bekanntgabe unserer investment pl ne bei der bankverein werther ag haben uns euphorische stimmen von aktion ren erreicht scheinbar haben die aktion re genug von jahrelangen experimenten
8611288 die unterst tzung unserer pl ne durch die aktion re auf der morgen stattfindenden hauptversammlung wird ma geblich sein wir vertrauen auf die unterst tzung der aktion re denn unsere strategie wird zukunft und wert des bankvereins nachhaltig sichern und so auch die kurse wieder steigen lassen
8611289 die zeit der experimente ist vorbei man muss sich beim bankverein werther von den jahrelangen behelfsm igen versuchen auf dem r cken der aktion re verabschieden der freitag ist wohl die letzte chance dazu
8611290 unsere ziele sind einfach werte erhalten und zwar durch fokus auf ein traditionsorientiertes kerngesch ft in dem aus unserer sicht viel potenzial schlummert von riskanten und unausgegorenen konzepten wie einer beteiligung der net mobile ag und den damit zu erwartenden riskanten operativen schritten halten wir herzlich wenig

8611294 unternehmen untersch tzen h ufig den aufwand und die komplexit t die mit einem gro projekt verbunden sind au erdem ist oft falsch verstandenes kostenbewusstsein ein ausschlaggeber f r eine nicht der komplexit t und dem anspruch angemessene projektmanagementstruktur
8611295 wir sind gegen ber jedem der als investor zu uns kommen will sehr aufgeschlossen
8611296 obwohl ein einstieg von staatsfonds bei siemens auf den ersten blick als positiv zu werten ist kann dies dem kurs nur kurzfristig helfen aus diesem grund sollte man die ank ndigung des managements nicht berbewerten
8611297 they are completely beside themselves he is terrified by the prospect of going to america
8611298 the offences for which our clients extradition is sought were committed on british soil and we maintain that any prosecution ought to be carried out by the appropriate british authorities
8611299 our client now faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot
8611300 man this little son of a bitch is pretty lucky imagine having megan fox as a babysitter
8611301 jeg vet ikke hva h brekke har utrettet for norsk kvinnefotball
8611302 i dont know how far ahead they planned that we obviously revealed our drum kit much earlier than they did
8611303 ive a feeling there was a oh s theres cymbals how can we put cymbals on our kit that would be the easiest way without having to rewire everything and re engineer the entire circuit board
8611304 my understanding on that drum kit is the cymbals are dual mapped so its just another way to trigger the exact same thing you can trigger on the kit
8611305 we have a lot of expandability you can plug in any drum kit and play it if you want to use a keyboard and play the right notes for drums you can do that you can use one of those hand sonic drums you can use any input device that transmits on midi channel 10 in our game to trigger the drums it could be a power glove
8611306 you can easily run a double bass pedal on our game
8611307 we have future expandability for high hat control pedals it would also be very easy for us to add other cymbals via the midi interface with the midi jack we can expand it to as many drums and cymbals as humanly possible theres just only so many that the casual consumer can take
8611308 our high hat control would not just be another way to trigger the high hat it would be a completely separate interface thats mapped differently and that correlates differently in game
8611309 it might just look like more songs but really the technology that were pushing forward and some of the features weve added its not just a title update it really is a new game with a lot of really great stuff
8611310 we actually have expansion ports on the back of our drum kits that let you attach three cymbals to your drum set
8611311 at harmonix we really are musicians first and game people second my drum set has three cymbals on it i dont know how many drum sets youve seen with two cymbals on them i guess thats a question for other people
8611312 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8611313 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8611314 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8611315 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8611316 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8611317 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8611318 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8611319 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8611320 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8611321 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8611322 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8611323 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8611324 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8611325 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8611326 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8611327 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8611328 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
8611329 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
8611330 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8611331 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8611332 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8611333 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8611334 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8611335 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8611336 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not
8611337 what i havent heard about gas going to 4 a gallon
8611338 is the world a safer place upon his her departure fromt the world stage in all tests gwb is and will always be a great world leader
8611339 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8611340 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8611341 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8611342 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8611343 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8611344 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8611345 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908
8611346 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes
8611347 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention
8611348 i will put my trust in the promises of god and since i am trusting him what can mere man do to me they are always twisting what i say all their thoughts are how to harm me
8611349 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
8611350 no my life is not better off in fact it is worse
8611351 i dont use liberal talking points i excrete liberal talking points
8611352 i dont use liberal talking points i create liberal talking points
8611353 he also says listing to his one sided rhetoric that comes to you via radio station filled with one sided propagandist looking to get rich by blindly riding off his coattail
8611354 calypso you speak like a true mind numbed liberal i am going to address your point bullet by bullet
8611355 you talk of how the cia tortures prisoners and yet say nothing of how our people have been tortured and murdered i guess it is not ok to merely waterboard a terrorist who by the way is not subject to the protection of the geneva convention but it is ok to be beheaded by a rusty and dull sword
8611356 do our people get that and what about abu graib do you know what those photos look like saturday night and ted kennedys oh the poor terrorist had to wear panties on his head boo hoo
8611357 show me the proof of the thousands upon thousands of dead civilians that were murdered by saddam just because some code pink moonbat says it doesnt mean it is true please provide any credible report
8611358 an excess mortality of nearly 100 000 deaths was reported in iraq for the period march 2003 september 2004 attributed to the invasion of iraq
8611359 i take it then you were for the surpeme court decision to upholding the decision to negate the dc ban on handguns i mean hey they were protecting the second amendment
8611360 at this point in the war name me all the people affected by the patriot act that were unfairly targeted by the patriot act i bet if bill clinton had wanted the patriot act youd have loved it
8611361 and what is that other than the fact that you hate bush
8611362 force may be used only in a truly just cause and solely for that purpose correcting a suffered wrong is considered a right intention while material gain or maintaining economies is not
8611363 just war conduct should be governed by the principle of minimum force
8611364 were you for or against the war in kosovo and why
8611365 when did this happen i mean in the last ten years bush never did this
8611366 show us the proof why this was pure conjecture there is proof that the military votes were infringed according to the fec
8611367 was that bushs fault what did he do or not do what did the local people do or not do did you know that there was a plan to reinforce the levees and when it came time to do so the environmentalists filed a lawsuit against the army corp of engineers and won thus repventing any more work from happening did you know that instead of using the federal money they got to improve the bilge pumps new orleans officials built a casino the locals had ample changes to either help prevent problems or get people out and they did nothing and they are democrats one and all
8611368 ahhh the swift boat attacks oh boo hoo i have yet to see john kerry sue any of those men for slander or release his military records compared to some of the filth i have seen posted against bush i would say kerry had it easy he could dish it out but he couldnt take it please do find a single thing the swift boat veterans said that wasnt true and post back
8611369 who cares i do give a crap if he unites us or not i want him to follow and implements the republican platform i take it the messiah will unite us wioh that extremely liberal racord fat chance
8611370 what science global warming that isnt science they have proven nothing there is no proof just conjecture they used phony data and no scientific method to prove their claims just alot of bullying tactics alternative energy has been around for 30 years and is has gotten no where nuclear is alernative energy can we use that
8611371 so what he has kept us and you safe id rather have him than some phony who reads a teleprompter well but has no orgininal thought

8611429 this is one experimental case that is indicative but there are many others
8611430 there is the possibility of creating designer drugs with this newly discovered information
8611431 these are models that conform to the point of view that the structures have been designed to exert very strong control of their motions
8611432 those motions correspond closely to the motions needed for their function
8611433 we need to make sure our prevention messages are comprehensive
8611434 in addition to talking about avoiding transmission health communication efforts should promote testing as well
8611435 one of the best ways to find college students is on facebook since thats where they meet and interact with each other
8611436 we found that two thirds of our participants were recruited online either through facebook or through e mail
8611437 studies show that if you have higher perceived knowledge you tend to be tested more
8611438 and that may partially contribute to the higher testing observed among black students in the study
8611439 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8611440 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8611441 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8611442 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8611443 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8611444 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8611445 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8611446 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address
8611447 because few interventions in critically ill adult patients reduce mortality to this extent the results of this trial were enthusiastically received and rapidly incorporated into guidelines
8611448 these recommendations have led to worldwide adoption of tight glucose control in a variety of intensive care unit icu settings
8611449 given the overall findings of this meta analysis it seems appropriate that the guidelines recommending tight glucose control in all critically ill patients should be re evaluated until the results of larger more definitive clinical trials are available
8611450 possible explanations for the discordant results of the study by van den berghe et al and the meta analysis by wiener et al are that the meta analysis is flawed the studies that form the basis of the meta analysis are flawed or inherently different or the findings of the study by van den berghe et al occurred due to random chance or as a result of another unique factor interacting with tight glycemic control
8611451 those investigating tight glycemic control should take a step back and address the fundamental questions of defining quality standards for tight glycemic control finding affordable methods of frequent and highly accurate measurement of blood glucose in the icu and conduct multicenter efficacy studies to determine if tighter glycemic control can reduce mortality under optimal conditions if tighter glycemic control can be proven effective in optimal conditions determining how to make that benefit available to millions of critically ill patients in both developed and resource poor countries around the world would be a truly worthwhile challenge there is no simple or clear answer to the complex problem of glycemic control in critically ill adults at present targeting tight glycemic control cannot be said to be either right or wrong
8611452 coccidiosis in broiler chickens identification epidemiological aspects and evaluation of gross intestinal lesions of infected birds
8611453 arsenic poisoning is behind many instances of ill health in southern asia including a rising number of cancer cases developing a low cost method of decontaminating ground water that is laced with high levels of arsenic is a key challenge for sustainable agriculture there
8611454 while there are some techniques available for treating relatively small quantities of water there has until now been no viable technology available for decontaminating groundwater on a large scale that can ensure safe irrigation and potable water supply
8611455 this project developed by queens is the only method which is eco friendly easy to use and deliverable to the rural community user at an affordable cost
8611456 from its inception we have had the vital support of indian based stakeholders such as village councils and local financial institutions this has been vital as they are the authorities who monitor the water supply and distribution in rural areas and provide micro credit to the local farmers
8611457 with their help we now have a solution which is transferable to many areas in need across asia
8611458 there have been a lot of complaints about rec procedures from researchers in recent years they often find the process onerous and bureaucratic however this study is the first time anyone has systematically analysed what recs are saying about cancer trial proposals
8611459 recs are looking for evidence that researchers are sensitive to ethical issues in particular to participants interests and that information given to potential participants explains the trial fully and truthfully researchers can improve their chances of success at ethical review by really good preparation
8611460 we have studied this in mice but it has naturally been difficult to do so in humans now we have had an opportunity to examine such transplants in an individual with type 1 diabetes
8611461 we previously know that amyloid production is a symptom of stress that leads to cell death in type 2 diabetes perhaps the same thing happens in a transplant when cells are exposed to great stress
8611462 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
8611463 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8611464 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
8611465 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
8611466 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy
8611467 there could be a way to stimulate growth of nerve cells to fight depression for example
8611468 what you really want is a missing cell type one that is not functioning properly to be derived from something else but you only want that cell type so i think this is a really important step forward in exercising what people really wanted and showing how well it can work by this gene over expression procedure
8611469 provides exciting new insights into yet another aspect of cell plasticity that was not appreciated previously and that offers great potential therapeutically direct reprogramming represents a more straight forward strategy to treat diseases involving loss of function of specific cell populations than approaches requiring an intermediate embryonic stem cell
8611470 more than a little surprised to find that we could use a combination of just three transcription factors to reprogram one cell type into another
8611471 combined a systematic approach to identifying the relevant transcription factors hard work and a bit of luck
8611472 by asking what genes you have to have turned on in the cell for it to become a beta cell
8611473 if you want to do reprogramming it doesnt take great insight to figure out that the key genes are transcription factors the proteins that bind dna and tell cells which genes to turn on and which to turn off
8611474 and the locks are transcription factors we asked which ones are present in the beta cell and that gave us 1 100 transcription factors to choose from eventually we learned that of the 1 100 only about 200 are actually expressed in cells that are involved in forming the pancreas
8611475 we decided that of the 200 we only cared about the ones that are expressed in the key part of the pancreas where the beta cells are and that got us down to about 28 then we did some lineage studies
8611476 and we got it down to nine joe said my best guess is its these nine and he were right it was a messy experiment mixing all nine and injecting them into the pancreas then we found out that it got better and better as we removed one gene at a time from the nine and eventually we found that it actually works best with three transcription factors that six of them arent that important and thats the fun of science
8611477 if it hadnt worked with those nine wed probably have dropped the experiment and gone onto something else there would have been just too many possible combinations of transcription factors to wade through
8611478 were intrigued by the possibility that this approach which has worked for pancreatic insulin producing cells could be more widely applied to many kind of cells especially those that are lost in disease or following injury
8611479 and at the same time we are exploring the possibility of using this general approach in a clinical context to make new beta cells for patients
8611480 unfortunately we have to state that attempts are being made to secure certain interests using force not the principles of strict observance of international law and denial of confrontational bloc thinking
8611481 a fine example of such irresponsible criminal actions is georgias aggression against south ossetia
8611482 ended the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe
8611483 what we would like to obtain is a political signal that the future of ukraine lies with the european union
8611484 expanding the group would realize russias goal of turning the sco into an anti american anti nato counterweight

8611488 prior studies have indicated reduced bone density in hiv infected patients but little was known whether fracture risk increased in this population
8611489 these data are the first to suggest that there is a clinically significant increase in bone fractures among hiv infected patients using data from a large healthcare system
8611490 hiv patients with risk for low bone density should be assessed and potentially treated to prevent fractures
8611491 further research is needed into the mechanisms of bone loss in this population

8611494 recent estimates indicate that if trends continue the way they are developing countries will face a 75 increase in the number of cervical cancer cases because of growth and aging of the population in the next two decades but it doesnt have to turn out that way
8611495 the discovery of hpv as the cause of cervical cancer has shaken a field that was stagnating and we are now in a new era where developing countries no longer have to be left behind
8611496 efforts are needed now to adapt the current price of the vaccines so they meet what individual countries can afford the solution may be tiered pricing according to gross national income per capita and according to the scale of country efforts
8611497 the models provide a useful roadmap for testing promising strategies in the field more research is needed to determine an efficient combination of these new approaches and each country will have to decide which is best for them but we are confident we have provided a valuable starting point for going forward
8611498 this new era of cervical cancer presents many opportunities and challenges ahead there is now realistic hope for controlling this disease where the toll is the highest and we have to seize this opportunity we in the cervical cancer community will be stepping up all our efforts to help developing countries get this disease under control

8611619 audio podcasting is almost uniquely suited to this application consider that podcast listeners spend tens of minutes not tens of seconds with your message when delivered through an audio podcast that means you can develop and convey more than a sound bite unlike traditional and online media audio podcasting is perfect for a multitasking world you can listen to an audio podcast while driving something i certainly hope you wouldnt do with online video even if you could take it with you in the car and you can take it with you you can listen to a lifestyle show or professional development seminar while walking on the beach in california riding a mountain bike outside scottsdale or hiking through central park deeper content adapted to multitasking portable in both time and space sounds like a winner to me

8611630 while demanding that we renegotiate his contract and pay pedro more than the 6 million signing bonus to which pedro agreed mr boras has contended that the contract we reached with pedro was consummated after the august 15 deadline
8611631 this claim was not raised on the evening of the 15th when we informed mr boras that major league baseball had confirmed that the contract was submitted in a timely fashion mr boras asserted this claim several days later after all of the draft signings had become publicized
8611632 in the 2006 round of collective bargaining the players association agreed to establish an august 15 signing deadline for drafted players with remaining collegiate eligibility
8611633 within hours after this years august 15 midnight deadline passed the players association learned from several sources that the commissioners office had extended the deadline for negotiating and reporting signings with drafted players this was done without notice to or consultation with the players association despite a firm deadline having been established through collective bargaining
8611634 i have read the statement issued by frank coonelly president of the pittsburgh pirates regarding pedro alvarez
8611635 moreover based on information gathered to date by the association franks statement is inaccurate in a number of respects while the association will not respond specifically through the press we are confident that at hearing the panel will agree that the commissioners office acted improperly when it unilaterally changed the terms of the deal it struck with the association in 2006

8611658 the best public policy is to have the price go up so people stop using oil
8611659 we have an oil problem in the world and its called depletion
8611660 i am not surprised for one second that the price of oil goes up constantly
8611661 this high oil prices is an incredible bonanza for this country we dont have a problem the world has a problem
8611662 people just see pump prices go up but when the price of your raw material goes up everybodys getting squeezed
8611663 canadas precious fresh water resource belongs to the people and cannot be bundled and privatized at the whim of government and corporate interests
8611664 water is a fundamental human right and any attempt to divert or export it whether to the u s or saudi arabia must defer to whats in the broad canadian public interest
8611665 in a pre election cycle theres great pressure from corporations to allow the export of fresh water if quebec went ahead other provinces would have to follow
8611666 my bill was intended as a safety measure before a water crisis blows up ill bring it back if theres an election but 90 per cent of canadas fresh water is under provincial control and that complicates things
8611667 we began the study months ago and it is a follow up to the one we did last year on the privatization of hydro qu bec we dont really know how much fresh water we have or whether exporting it would make economic sense but weve got to think about it and be ready if the issue comes to the boil further down the road
8611668 they are politically charged of course and i dont see the government acting at present
8611669 i think the mei is trying to spur an ideological debate between right and left with the issue of commercializing fresh water alongside the controversy over private healthcare
8611670 water must be above politics and exports would pose grave environmental risks
8611671 itll be interesting to see i expect that some countries may object
8611672 i think it ultimately is in everybodys interest to ensure there is some kind of authority in the area some kind of environmental and commercial authority
8611673 these measures will send a clear message to the world canada takes responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8611674 my expectation would be that we will have another minority
8611675 i think thats the reality of the current political environment i think anyone getting a majority in the current political alignment that we have in canada would be unlikely
8611676 what it does quite simply is that it gives the government a fresh mandate and i think that will give the government another couple of years to proceed
8611677 the polls do indicate that the next election will in all likelihood bring a minority one way or the other
8611678 were going to have to judge how the parliamentary agenda is unfolding i think weve had a productive two and a half years i do think that that has slowed somewhat in recent weeks
8611679 its step 1 but its a pretty good sign that step 2 3 and 4 are on the way
8611680 while funding for 227 spaces sounds low when you multiply that over several years its a significant increase in capacity
8611681 they dont tell you why you didnt get in so you can know what to improve on

8611684 its important because the type of turtle that was found is a very primitive variation on modern turtles and tortoises it can tell us more about living turtles inherited traits relating towards egg laying and nesting

8611686 there was apparently a miscommunication about when that boom was allowed to be over the tracks
8611687 there was supposed to be a verbal ok to start work
8611688 i just heard a smash and everybody was lying on the ground
8611689 but because the operator started early the train was going at full speed
8611690 im going to be looking for if there was indeed a miscommunication how that could possibly happen
8611691 people were swerving all over trying not to get hit
8611692 is reserved for collectors of my original paintings and i have kept the site semi private so that there is some sense of intimacy
8611693 collectors sign up and post the paintings they own make comments about paintings start forums about say framing or artists and collectors
8611694 they each have a page where they can if they choose say a little something about themselves
8611695 they are really wonderful interesting people who happen to be connected by the fact that they have an affinity for what i paint
8611696 id thought it would be great if they had a community where they could meet each other i had thought of doing this years ago but didnt know how to go about doing it then i discovered ning and voila
8611697 it was harder emotionally than i thought it would be going in
8611698 now i am faced with having to say goodbye to him
8611699 and its going to be very difficult i feel like im grieving im grieving the loss i had a baby and now im not going to have a baby
8611700 as sad as i am i dont regret doing it i forever will have a special part in his life ill have a special bond with him forever
8611701 once i started thinking about it it was like a ball hurtling out of control
8611702 i have a very kind and wonderful husband he was on board from the very beginning
8611703 i think its a wonderful thing she has done im very proud
8611704 she just called me on the phone and said you need to sit down
8611705 this was probably the easiest out of the four i only gained 17 pounds it was like someone was looking out for me being very kind
8611706 some aspects were hard because that should have been me having the baby
8611707 seeing pregnant people isnt easy for someone who cant get pregnant
8611708 its amazing how someone could do this for another person
8611709 i just think everyone deserves a baby if they want one

8611753 es war das erste rennen auf dieser neuen strecke deshalb konnten die teams ihren benzinverbrauch nur anhand der freitagsdaten analysieren den daten aus einer halben stunde training und einer weiteren halben stunde qualifikation
8611754 da dieser kurs f r alle neu war auch f r uns haben wir mit den teams ber alle technischen aspekte des rennens gesprochen auch ber den benzinverbrauch
8611755 alle teams wurden am freitagabend dazu befragt und alle haben gesagt dass es okay sein sollte auch wenn es knapp wird
8611756 w hrend des meetings das wir immer mit allen teilnehmern ein paar stunden vor dem rennen abhalten haben wir noch einmal klargestellt und best tigt dass das gp2 reglement eindeutig erlaubt und es immer getan hat dass in der boxengasse noch einmal aufgetankt werden kann bevor die autos auf die startaufstellung geschickt werden
8611757 w hrend des rennens waren die rundenzeiten schneller als erwartet weil mehr gummi auf der strecke war und die fahrer auf der f r sie neuen strecke mehr selbstvertrauen hatten
8611758 zudem war die lufttemperatur niedriger als im qualifying das hat in kombination mit den schnelleren rundenzeiten dazu gef hrt dass der benzinverbrauch h her war als alle vorher errechnet hatten vielleicht erkl rt das warum manche teams sich dazu entschieden haben vor dem start in der boxengasse noch einmal aufzutanken w hrend andere lieber riskiert haben es nicht zu tun

8611760 i have cancer and i saw leroy on the discovery channel
8611761 the cancer patient who gave all of us the words to talk openly about cancer
8611762 in the first half it showed that we were the better team when we moved the ball around
8611763 but we did not have the best game the ball kept bobbling up us on and i dont know if it was because it was a slick pitch or if it was a new ball or guys who werent ready or it was nerves that took over
8611764 i think a 1 0 result isnt a great result especially at home
8611765 we feel we should have done a lot better we gave up the ball in the second half way too many times and we couldnt get a rhythm going
8611766 obviously 1 0 is good for us because it forces them to come at us and try to score against us i didnt really think there was much threat tonight except for one or two chances that we made mistakes on that could have cost us a goal
8611767 i think going into honduras if we play well defensively theres no reason why we should not come out of this stage
8611768 a 1 0 score is actually better than it seems because it forces the opponent to try to win and if we can score away we have a huge advantage
8611769 we could have had more goals but this is what we were capable of today but like i said it puts them on the back foot as far as getting a three point result in honduras
8611770 when i called she said umm which dog are we talking about again

8611793 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8611794 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8611795 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8611796 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8611797 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8611798 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8612000 our evaluation of obamas sms service leading up to his vp announcement demonstrates the inadequacy of the sms technical infrastructure to support large scale marketing campaigns
8612001 as mobile marketing increasingly becomes a key channel for campaign managers and marketers interested in communicating with voters and consumers a solution for testing and monitoring common short codes is needed to ensure the delivery of critical information and reliability the obama event underscores the absolute need to monitor the performance of common short codes used in high impact marketing or sales initiatives in which actual delivery of the message to the consumer is important to the overall success of the campaign
8612002 keynotes unrivaled expertise in measuring and monitoring the quality of the mobile end user experience from the web to sms can help businesses select mobile services providers and realize the return on their mobile investments

8612005 we believe that fda approval of onsolis tm and its u s commercial launch should add considerable value to bdsi based on the aggregate 30 million in approval and launch milestone payments sales based milestone payments and double digit royalty on sales which provide the means to accelerate development of our pipeline in addition the outcome of the onsolis tm nda review validates the bema tm drug delivery platform and should immediately enhance the value of other bema tm products in development particularly bema tm buprenorphine our second pain product we believe that the future of bdsi continues to be very promising
8612006 we have been working over the last several months with meda ab our partner for the commercialization of onsolis tm to prepare for a potential rems requirement these activities have put us in a position to respond rapidly to fdas request depending on fda review time approval could occur as early as the first quarter or as late as second quarter of 2009
8612007 with respect to our financial position we have managed our cash prudently over the course of 2008 and have a few months of cash in reserve
8612008 we have a financial plan that includes several choices to bridge the gap to approval and the receipt of milestone payments from meda totaling 30 million importantly we will seek to only raise the capital required to reach the anticipated approval with little or no dilution to our stockholders it should be noted that the costs associated with finalization and implementation of the rems for onsolis tm will be the responsibility of meda

8612096 you have a wonderful personality develop it be yourself dont imagine that your perfection lies in accumulating or possessing external things your perfection is inside of you if only you could realise that you would not want to be rich ordinary riches can be stolen from a man real riches cannot in the treasury house of your soul there are infinitely precious things that may not be taken from you and so try to so shape your life that external things will not harm you and try also to get rid of personal property it involves sordid preoccupation endless industry continual wrong personal property hinders individualism at every step
8612097 you should give up private property it hinders you from realising your perfection it is a drag upon you it is a burden your personality does not need it it is within you and not outside of you that you will find what you really are and what you really want

8612109 on the other hand i will never hear him sing again so it was definitely an emotional thing last night
8612110 we talked and laughed and all kinds of things the night before
8612111 we wanted to get every minute in and nobody wanted to go to bed and then all the sudden its 6 a m and were at the hospital
8612112 mostly because i expect sounds and they are not there
8612113 she teaches me and i teach her we have the same text book so we learn a little then sign a little and then learn a little more and laugh about how neither of us can get it right

8612116 after carefully assessing the situation the bureau of the organising committee for the fifa world cup today decided that the preliminary competition match between georgia and the republic of ireland will take place at a neutral venue due to the current unrest in georgia
8612117 although the georgian football federation gff had hoped to host this match at home in tbilisi it will now be played in mainz germany on the originally scheduled date of september 6 2008 with georgia acting as the host association
8612118 its good i have a connection to charlton and im also going to be close to my family

8612131 with rising gas prices and whatnot i thought its good for the environment you get a free bike and it saves them parking
8612132 i think it says theyre innovative and changing with the times
8612133 the problem with that is how does it discourage you from bringing a car

8612201 franks conclusion was pretty sceptical about whether the fact that former jihadi scholars are now issuing theological condemnations of al qaida would have much short term effect on the ground in britain or elsewhere

8612238 the fans are brilliant when they are behind us and they have to realise the effect it has when they are not behind us it can all change at the weekend
8612239 football is a bit like this you go through periods like this it has happened to other managers and happened a bit last year
8612240 the disappointing thing is the players are the ones that have to go out and perform
8612241 you cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today
8612242 its very hard to take yourself too seriously when you look at the world from outer space
8612243 it was a very good victory for the supporters although we would have preferred not to have conceded that goal in the last minute
8612244 we didnt want extra time because our fans had traveled so far but we had to do it
8612245 it was great to play in an english cup tie for me and it was obvious how important it was to our fans
8612246 we were happy to show them we feel the same way by getting the result in the end and getting into the next round
8612247 we thought we had done enough to win but coventry came back at us and we had to start again
8612248 but we did it again and we have to be happy to be into the next round now
8612249 but i want to play and will play in any position
8612250 my manager wanted me to play there so of course i agreed
8612251 if it means doing a job for the team i am more than happy to do so

8612256 reducing health inequities is an ethical imperative social injustice is killing people on a grand scale
8612257 there is no good biological reason why this should be the case
8612258 these health inequalities are preventable they arise from the circumstances in which people are born grow live work and age the social determinants of health
8612259 taking action to deal with preventable causes of illness means taking social action a toxic combination of poor social policies unfair economic arrangements and bad politics is responsible
8612260 the commission considers health care a common good not a market commodity
8612261 the commission advocates financing the health care system through general taxation and or mandatory universal insurance the evidence is compellingly in favour of a publicly funded health care system
8612262 we are distressed by the reports we see of healthcare simply being unavailable to people because of inability to pay and we see that throughout lower and middle income countries
8612263 not for me to tell one of the richest countries on earth how it should organise its health care system
8612264 its not perhaps the best use of money thats being spent there are a lot of people who feel that and would actually like to see coming out of the current presidential campaign in the us proposals for a universal health insurance
8612265 there is no nato naval build up in the black sea as russian authorities are claiming in the media

8612270 the presidents confirmed their commitment to the principle of respecting the historical and cultural traditions of each country and efforts aimed at maintaining the unity of states and their territorial integrity
8612271 i am sure that the united position of the sco member states will have international resonance
8612272 and i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression

8612287 as i have reflected on the great issues facing this generation in the life of the church i have become more and more convinced that the answers are to be found through a prayerful faithful and creative engagement with the deposit of faith presented in the documents of the second vatican council and its great summary the catechism of the catholic church
8612288 the vision of fit for mission church is the vision of the second vatican council
8612289 however the questions and challenges that the council fathers saw in embryo we now face in full force such as the challenge of secular humanism the question of moral values in a scientific technological culture and the increasing tensions caused by reason sundered from faith
8612290 all catholics who love the church and care deeply about the future of catholicism in our country
8612291 i know that many of you share my sense of pressing responsibility to foster and promote an authentic catholic identity resisting the pressures to compromise even abandon the truths of our faith
8612292 the majority of our energy and charisms as the people of god are focused on being gathered through the sacraments
8612293 lay liturgical ministries are well developed in most parishes though there are exceptions there is a good deal of collaboration between most clergy and laity in service of the liturgy
8612294 though we are strengthened and healed by the lord through his word and sacraments the majority of us are not responding to our lords call to go out on his mission of hope in particular mission in the parishes with families and young people are undeveloped or underdeveloped with a few exceptions
8612295 part two of gaudium et spes goes on to identify five urgent problems that caused major anxiety in the 1960s
8612296 forty years on i believe the same five areas cause equal anxiety among most people marriage and the family culture social economic life political life war and peace
8612297 just as the council fathers before me i want to encourage you all to attempt to read the signs of the times in the light of the gospel the council and human experience
8612298 there are some things in life which are so important that to dissent from them is to lose the whole meaning of life
8612299 i have written this document in the hope that through our far reaching fit for mission review in the diocese of lancaster we may realize with joy the great gift with which we have been entrusted
8612300 when we all hold true to the beauty and truth of the church established by jesus for the glory of the father in the living presence of the holy spirit then the true glory of gods church will shine out for all to see

8612384 if you guessed it had to do with my father then you guessed right
8612385 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame
8612386 semester hasnt started na so he is here to talk to us
8612387 both but mostly the people across the road time to be nice to them especially since grant money is drying up everywhere
8612388 yes yes we love the finn but when the time comes we shall suck up to bill he has the money after all
8612389 of course i do but sometimes his stuff is not fit for our purpose for the kind of work we do he understands that
8612390 i am sure he does not fit for purpose is that why you con poor housewives to switch to linux
8612391 oh that is not our fault we dont con people to do anything people try different things and they choose it is a free world
8612392 i could have told him that years ago how did he reach this conclusion now
8612393 well not just me people like me with the recession and all there is no grant money no support no new people needed anywhere so no jobs esp in the states
8612394 nothing much really stick around here for a while do more post docs in other places travel
8612395 dude you just told me its alright it is a good life
8612396 well i trust you if you say its a good life i am sure it will be

8612398 oh i thought your firm pays for your us trips
8612399 because i fly to other places on personal trips and i might not be working with the company anymore
8612400 because of the good life we are going to have
8612401 but i thought you wanted me to do my dissertation
8612402 as a stepping stone to a real job yes but as you are anyway unemployable i dont think it matters
8612403 okay if thats how you see it i can look at other options
8612404 that too but also other jobs which pay slightly more
8612405 like you know in the city be a banker or something
8612406 no but if are absolutely sure you want me to have a real job i can consider being one
8612407 you do realise i could say yes and you will be in trouble
8612408 see this is the problem the jobs i can get i can never get because you dont like them
8612409 yes thats why you are not a banker because i dont like it you have always wanted to be a banker all your life your true calling

8612416 i hope the fans get behind me as i know this is the game they are looking for the team to do well in
8612417 i have obviously come back here in special circumstances and i always knew people would oppose the move
8612418 with that said i think this game is one where people need to back the whole team and hopefully i can get a goal and change a few minds
8612419 for sure i received calls from england to ask me about my situation in september
8612420 i just spoke with my agent luis aparicio and saying i did speak with wigan or whatever other club is a lie
8612421 that was my first start but fitness wise i think i really proved that i am game and up for it
8612422 as much as it is not my position out wide because i am an out and out striker i do feel that i do give a little something else whether that be in terms of attacking or defending or whatever

8612516 hes assured us hes going to work very hard this summer his body has grown so fast that maybe his muscles havent kept up with his bones hes got a real good stride had about the quietest weekend of any team at the 2008 nhl entry draft viktor kozlov a big guy that skates well and moves the puck well his maturing level is at 24 25 years old when he gets there he might be at 230 240 pounds
8612517 he probably thinks he needs to get back and get stronger
8612518 hes realizing hes not far off his dream you can tell how badly he wants it his determination is good hes got such good all around hockey skills hes a smart poised player hes not a flashy player but hes in the right place hes got incredible hockey sense
8612519 in the organizations mind hes going to need some seasoning in the american hockey league
8612520 but he made great strides last summer so who knows what hes capable of
8612521 were not going to send him back to junior as an over ager
8612522 he signed last fall he was that impressive in training camp we envision him probably starting the year in wilkes barre and getting some seasoning
8612523 with dustin he needs to work on his quickness and his overall strength
8612524 those two things are whats probably followed him around the last couple years we just saw too much skill and too much hockey sense to overlook his quickness improved and we dont think hes near the peak of what his skating will be the next couple years
8612525 i think casey has to improve his quickness and learn to play at a higher pace be on the move more often he played a couple years in tier ii which was a little slower and he could control the pace hes very good at protecting the puck but he really didnt have to turn his feet over like he would as he climbs to various levels
8612526 casey is behind the curve a little bit as far as the plan that was kind of mapped out for him
8612527 if he has a good summer and impressed in the fall hell be eligible to play in wilkes barre
8612528 i think casey has to improve his quickness and learn to play at a higher pace be on the move more often he played a couple years in tier ii which was a little slower and he could control the pace hes very good at protecting the puck but he really didnt have to turn his feet over like he would as he climbs to various levels
8612529 for him the issue coming out of college minnesota was getting stronger
8612530 i think hes addressed that or hes showing that he can compete for a job at the strength he has right now but after going through a whole season plus playoffs in the american hockey league hes realized he has to get a lot stronger hes an exciting talent pittsburgh really covets him hes a guy thats knocking on the door
8612531 he was drafted with a bit of offense to him but hes projected to be an all around defenseman
8612532 puck decisions getting his feet quicker in the defensive zone thats where were looking for him to improve hes got size hes not piling up the points in college but hes making strides
8612533 its what role does his coaching staff envision for him in the next couple years
8612534 in college a player has to wait until his junior or senior year if he does have those offensive capabilities hes got to wait for his opportunity i envision him having some more development time in college
8612535 what really jumps out with brian is leadership capabilities and determination
8612536 he does a lot of things well not one thing exceptionally well just does a lot of things well everywhere hes gone hes been a quality teammate his leadership and work ethic rubs off on other people
8612537 its just time for him to improve a little bit of everything
8612538 get a little quicker puck decisions but hes a solid defensive defenseman were still wondering if theres a little bit more offense under the surface than hes shown so far
8612539 but when we see the end product he could be a guy playing at 225 or 230 hes got a good work ethic he doesnt get beat one on one he has good puck skills i dont envision him being an offensive defenseman but his passing is above average
8612540 we liked his skating ability his tenacity he moves the puck pretty well
8612541 the issue with him is strength and maybe develop his offensive game
8612542 hes a guy that hoped to have a better season this year
8612543 he had a solid career at notre dame maybe its going to take a bit for him to find his way but we still consider him a prospect
8612544 our evaluations on him have been really really good all year just because of where he comes from and the ambiguity in that situation hes another guy that we thought might fall to us and when it got to the fifth round we said were not letting this guy go any further
8612545 our evaluations on him have been really really good all year
8612546 just because of where he comes from and the ambiguity in that situation hes another guy that we thought might fall to us and when it got to the fifth round we said were not letting this guy go any further
8612547 hes a good athlete and hes quick that along with the size we think this could eventually come together he has a chance of really developing
8612548 als we het dit jaar weer niet nodig hebben ga ik er wat van zeggen
8612549 boekhandels kopen de boeken van uitgeverijen als wij van hen bijvoorbeeld 25 procent korting krijgen kunnen we natuurlijk niet datzelfde percentage doorberekenen aan de school dan zouden we er niets meer aan verdienen het is alsof we met coca cola de strijd moeten aanbinden over het leveren van hun colaflesjes
8612550 het is alsof we coca cola beconcurreren over het leveren van hun flesjes
8612551 en wij schoolboekenleveranciers zeggen kom maar op met die tienduizenden pakketjes
8612552 een uitgever gaat echt niet persoonlijk praten met mevrouw jansen als er bijvoorbeeld een boek ontbreekt ik ben in tien minuten op school als er wat mankeert malmberg natuurlijk niet
8612553 maar wij hebben prima contact met venlo ook wij kunnen het oplossen als er iets ontbreekt

8612600 has traced the origin of the funding of 9 11 back to financial accounts in pakistan where high ranking and well known al qaeda operatives played a major role in moving the money forward eventually into the hands of the hijackers located in the us
8612601 on the eve of the publication of its report the 9 11 commission was given a stunning document from pakistan claiming that pakistani intelligence officers knew in advance of the 9 11 attacks
8612602 pakistan gave tens of thousands of dollars through its lobbyists in the united states to members of the 9 11 inquiry commission to convince them to drop some anti pakistan findings in the report
8612603 pakistan has never indulged in the illegal activity of bribing or buying influence anywhere in the world
8612604 a possible isi role in the 9 11 plot remains unclear

8612645 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial
8612646 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8612647 esta situaci n se alan sucede porque carabineros act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8612648 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8612649 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche que result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta situaci n desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8612650 emplazamos al general de carabineros de la ix regi n a que informe objetivamente sobre el origen de los balines que afectan a su personal
8612651 muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche
8612652 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches
8612653 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos

8612657 the leaders of the sco member states welcome the signing in moscow of the six principles for regulating the south ossetia conflict and support russias active role in assisting peace and cooperation in this region
8612658 the sco member states are deeply concerned over tensions around the south ossetian issue and call on all sides concerned to peacefully resolve existing problems through dialogue
8612659 send a serious signal to those who are trying to justify the aggression that was committed
8612660 it is well known who connived with the georgian authorities and even goaded them on in pursuit of their own selfish goals in these extreme conditions we stayed calm and continued a responsible and predictable line of policy
8612661 the importance of this task has now grown to achieve it we must avoid confrontational thinking while strictly keeping to the principles of international law
8612662 the west has ignored the attack by the georgian military on tskhinvali i believe that is how it all started
8612663 we all believe that the subsequent actions by russia were aimed at protecting this long suffering people
8612664 we are confident that the position of sco member states will produce an appropriate resonance through the international community and i hope this will give a serious signal to those who are trying to justify the aggression that was committed
8612665 a georgian drone was flying from south to north over tskhinvali at 00 10 moscow time 20 10 gmt south ossetian military units opened fire at the uav and shot it down

8612699 patent expiries are challenging times however following the recent approval of cimzia for crohns disease in the u s and the positive opinions for neupro for rls and vimpat for epilepsy in europe the time is now to take action to shape ucb for the future and become a specialist company focused on successfully delivering our new medicines to patients earlier this month we announced the shape project which aims to re allocate eur 300 million within the next three years towards increased investments into ucbs core cns and immunology business areas while also seeking to improve ucbs competitiveness

8612704 we were pleased with the significant interest shown in retigabine and we have selected gsk as a collaborator because we believe they are ideally suited and strongly committed to the continued development of this important compound
8612705 gsks development expertise and strong commercial infrastructure will be critical to maximizing the worldwide potential of retigabine we believe this collaboration will strengthen our ability to bring this medicine to patients suffering from epilepsy and a variety of other conditions
8612706 gsk is looking forward to working with valeant to provide important medicines like retigabine to the medical community and to the patients we serve
8612707 there is a significant need for novel anti epileptic drugs as almost one third of patients with epilepsy continue to experience seizures despite treatment with currently available medications we believe that retigabine could potentially play a significant role in improving the management of epilepsy and is a welcome addition to gsks portfolio
8612708 these results showing the beneficial impact of alpharadin in terms of pain palliation are important as improved quality of life alongside increased survival are the two key goals of anti cancer therapy of patients with skeletal metastases
8612709 these results build on the positive phase ii clinical data package that we have already assembled with alpharadin the highlight of which was the significant survival benefits that we have already reported in patients with hrpc based on our clinical trials to date i am very confident that alpharadin has the potential to become an important new therapy for patients with prostate cancer this view has been reinforced by the enthusiastic and positive response we have received from key opinion leaders around the world to our unique approach to treating hrpc

8612739 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8612807 that is the mandate that he mugabe was given by the sadc southern african development community regional bloc and he is not going to stop forming that new cabinet the mdc are not serious at all
8612808 you will be killing the talks once you form a government forget about talks it is a disaster and an act of insanity to think that mugabe can go it alone
8612809 once he does that forms a new government then he has put a final nail on this dialogue so what in fact you are doing is you are making people suffer and therefore declaring a war on the people
8612810 formally we are going to write a letter to the facilitator about the breaches that have occurred
8612811 i am not aware of that our hope is that all parties to the conflict in zimbabwe will abide by the agreement and finalise whatever outstanding issues that need to be finalised and signed

8612813 may be a strategy to arm twist the mdc to accept the deal that is on the table
8612814 the formation of a new government sends a message that talks my have collapsed

8612823 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8612824 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8612825 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8612826 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8612827 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
8612828 one of the benefits and pleasures of being an actor is having the opportunity to travel around the united states to travel overseas i began traveling to europe and asia when i was about 20 and the respect that our country had the regard that our country had throughout the world was so tremendous the embrace that youd receive just for being an american was extraordinary and over the last eight years during my travels ive seen that love for our country become so compromised that i dont know how well ever regain our stature in the world
8612829 if you go overseas you see how much theres an excitement that a country that the rest of the world felt got so lost suddenly is on track enough to make a change this dramatic not only an african american but a man whose name is barack obama theres so many different elements of it that suddenly make i think the rest of the world feel like hey maybe theyre not as insane as we think they are and that to me is primarily what i keep seeing
8612830 keep moving on my vocation so that i will be ready as soon as his will becomes clear to me
8612831 many competent men who are called to priesthood often end up doing one of the many other things that they are capable of instead of following their true vocation
8612832 in souls that are striving to rise in the service of god our lord it is characteristic of the good spirit to give courage and strength consolations tears inspirations and peace
8612833 it is characteristic of the evil spirit to harass with anxiety to afflict with sadness to raise obstacles backed by false reasonings that disturb the soul thus he seeks to prevent the soul from advancing
8612834 a clue that they are not from the good spirit god
8612835 despondency is a form of desolation and just as the holy spirit normally guides a person in consolation the evil spirit normally guides during desolation
8612836 though in desolation we must never change our former resolutions it will be very advantageous to intensify our activity against the desolation
8612837 this idea of acting against agere contra is very important in discernment
8612838 the false reasonings begin to melt away and what previously seemed heavy and burdensome becomes light and a joy
8612839 will god begin to make the next step clear and the obstacles will be seen for what they are false reasonings
8612840 the first step is the hardest and god always gives much more in return than what he asks of us
8612841 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen

8612852 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8612853 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8612854 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8612858 the first time we called the list it was tough the second time was tough but weve gotten some commitments
8612859 right now we have five or six helping after the convention we hope to have many more
8612860 indicate that unity is not just a one way street but a two way street and enable certain people that have not yet been able to become involved to become more fully engaged
8612861 should be the poster child for how clinton donors and obamas finance team get along

8612867 they did indicate last monday they would like that discussion to reopen you are hearing a strong reaction from us on that front
8612868 one of the reasons that discussion was initiated was to prevent some of the actions that are being considered now in this plan
8612869 the company indicated in terms of the numbers they are dealing with that a number of those people might be eligible for early retirement
8612870 what they have put before us is much more extensive and much more serious than anything we have contemplated up to this point

8612915 iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and that the program remains frozen
8612916 the hands of a terrorist organization or an unauthorized state
8612917 the wider nuclear network has been monitored for many years by a joint anglo american intelligence effort but rather than shut it down investigations by law enforcement bodies such as the fbi and britains revenue amp customs have been aborted to preserve diplomatic relations
8612918 not named since obviously our officials are ashamed of admitting to these relations
8612919 could be used in manufacturing enough enriched uranium to produce 7 nuclear weapons a year
8612920 im not supporting turkeys nuclear energy program anymore because im not clear about what the real intention is lets put it that way

8612935 i am concerned about where our country is headed you see more and more socialism
8612936 in terms of state spending in relation to the gross state product oklahoma state government is one of the smallest in the country state spending in relation to personal income is lower than it has been in the last 25 years tax relief proponents will always have a strong constituency but we must also watch over our states long term fiscal health
8612937 with an expected state surplus now is the time to reduce the tax burden on oklahomans
8612938 i believe this position can be defended scientifically far more effectively than the pro abortion position that life begins at birth
8612939 i believe that the state of oklahoma has a responsibility to enforce the laws currently on the books in regards to immigration
8612940 i support hb 1804 i believe that immigrants should go through the proper channels and obey our laws
8612941 i support english as the official language of oklahoma and i therefore stand in support of sb 163 my opponent has said that he voted for this bill but the truth is that he voted to send it back to a conference committee knowing full well it would not make it out for a floor vote before the end of this years legislative session if elected i will work for initiatives in support of the english language and american values and i will be honest and above board in my official actions i will fight against the operation of trucks of foreign registration and questionable condition here and work to prevent abuses of eminent domain
8612942 ive started writing a lot of riffs on synthesizers and theres a lot more electronics samples and drum loops on it
8612943 i have a room in my apartment that is my office studio space
8612944 my own studio my dream come true its a spare bedroom in our house when we first saw this house last year i was amazed that one of the bedrooms had good light a cathedral ceiling and was pink obviously it was waiting for us to come along and buy it its filled top to bottom with all of my stuff a lot of storage drawers a small jewelers bench a table in the middle of the room so that everything is convenient and within reach in a word i must say that having a room of my own is pure bliss
8612945 since i mostly have been needlefelting lately i grab enough roving needles wire and whatever i think i need for a project for the day and hit the cafes sidewalks and parks needlefelting is a mysterious temptress that lures in the passerby my studio is the den officially but my work and supplies linger in several spots i have a pinata closet and also bags boxes and bins of supplies in the den spare room and laundry room the dolls i create are quite demanding and they jump out of the roving and tell me their tales i always have an idea of where im going but sometimes i take a detour
8612946 we have not found willing partners on the other side of the table
8612947 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8612948 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8612949 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business in iraq but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else then thats where we need to be
8612950 is proposing to use the government to remake economic policies in a way that hasnt been seen in washington in decades
8612951 under any scenario were going to see more nuclear power because its just going to be more cost effective once theres a price on carbon
8612952 the first question is how do you do a tax cut and fight a war which is what george bush did
8612953 she never really answered the key question is he obama prepared to be president
8612954 issue she put out there rather dramatically during the primaries
8612955 are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8612956 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8612957 let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8612958 prompted a mccarthyite denunciation by the house un american activities committee
8612959 like his friend paul robeson and others davis perceived the soviet union as a staunch foe of racism as he later put it in his memoirs and at one point he joined the communist party
8612960 by the time they obama and davis met davis had been out of politics for decades and mentor may exaggerate his role in the young mans life still its clear that obama did seek advice from the old man and that what he got was undiluted
8612961 stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8612962 god has given us each of us a free will and a responsibility to answer for our actions
8612963 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8612964 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8612965 saint augustine wondered about the stages of human development before birth how this related to the question of ensoulment and what it meant for life in the kingdom of god
8612966 quite clear on the immorality of abortion as evil violence destructive of the very fabric of human bonds and society
8612967 we expect to see that kind of thing in myanmar not on the streets of denver
8612968 the denver police department is committed to looking into each and every allegation of unnecessary force
8612969 one instance with the media shouldnt paint the entire event
8612970 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8612971 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8612972 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8612973 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8612974 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8612975 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8612976 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8612977 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8612978 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8612979 im going to be vice president of my fantasy football league
8612980 the process in selecting a v p is one that john mccain is keeping very close to his chest
8612981 hes a person i have a lot of confidence in i think hes going to do the right thing
8612982 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8612983 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8612984 tell me what democracy looks like this is what democracy looks like
8612985 i just cant imagine driving through my neighborhood at home and seeing a security checkpoint
8612986 its pretty neat we can still do this in this country
8612987 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8612988 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8612989 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8612990 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8612991 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8612992 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8612993 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8612994 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8612995 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8612996 i ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years
8612997 t he job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and to restore american leadership in the world
8612998 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8612999 joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding instincts and insight america will have the national security leadership

8613020 all of the services provided are nhs services and we have ended the ability of the private sector to apply spot pricing 40 higher than nhs rates by imposing a single tariff which means that the operation costs the same irrespective of where its carried out
8613021 we have no predisposition towards the private sector but gps and pharmacists have always been private contractors to the nhs and there is no socialist principle being abrogated here our focus must be on outcomes

8613023 the commission had to penalise the officials since they were not quick and prompt in providing information as sought by the applicants
8613024 normally the officials heckle the applicants and feel it demeaning to respond to the applications of the common men this is sheer mockery of rti ion bihar

8613663 what we have discovered is more extreme and akin to saying that all metro areas even those that are barely visible at night to the aliens have a population of about 10 million
8613664 we are excited because these galaxies are virtually invisible yet contain a tremendous amount of dark matter
8613665 this helps us better understand the particle that makes up dark matter and it teaches us something about how galaxies form in the universe
8613666 in december 2007 i was offered the position of investigator to focus on an unsolved double homicide from 1999
8613667 our chief of police darryl griffis read an internet article about dr bonds work at the university of leicester and northamptonshire police in developing latent prints on fired casings and it was decided that we should attempt to have our casings tested
8613668 we contacted dr bond and were invited to bring the evidence to northampton for processing in the hope that that with the leicester process a latent fingerprint might be located on the actual casing s itself which would help to bring more evidence against a possible suspect
8613669 this will be my first visit to the u k and i look forward to meeting with dr bond his staff and the members of the northamptonshire police
8613670 your process was one of many avenues located on the internet which showed promise towards assisting us on this case
8613671 weve made movies to show this traffic jam as a function of energy at some energies the traffic is moving and at others the electron traffic is completely blocked
8613672 it has been a frustrating and embarrassing problem to explain why this is the case
8613673 its like taking some cars off the highway during rush hour all of a sudden the traffic starts to move
8613674 in essence the research shows that what is believed to be required to increase the superconductivity in these systems stronger magnetic interactions also pushes the system closer to the quantum traffic jam status where lack of holes locks the electrons into positions from which they cannot move its like gassing up the cars and then jamming them all onto the highway at once theres lots of energy but no ability to go anywhere
8613675 we need to look for materials with such strong pairing but which dont exhibit this mottness or quantum traffic jam effect
8613676 our hope is that they will have less traffic jam effect while having stronger electron pairing
8613677 this is a promising new lead in the search for biological pathways that contribute to obesity
8613678 this finding may eventually lead to the development of new drugs to regulate appetite in people who have not had success with other treatments
8613679 to whom the fat rolls im tired of books where a self loathing heroine is teased to the point where she starves herself skinny in hopes of a fabulous new life
8613680 this riveting book can awaken humanity it reveals the simple power of four phrases to transform your life its all based in love by an author spreading love you should get ten copies of it one for you and nine to give away its that good
8613681 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
8613682 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
8613683 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
8613684 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
8613685 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable
8613686 i dont have money to buy food or pay for the utilities
8613687 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8613688 they showed significant stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and the tissue itself was more inflamed than in our lean patients
8613689 to whom the fat rolls im tired of books where a self loathing heroine is teased to the point where she starves herself skinny in hopes of a fabulous new life
8613690 it basically means he has no regard for human life
8613691 hes very dangerous and we want to get him off the street
8613692 garden amp gun attracts men and women who embody the active outdoor lifestyle and have an eye for beauty an ear for fine prose a passion for the southern landscape and waters
8613693 you know what the world really needs a magazine for the hunter who likes to match his venison with a really fine bordeaux
8613694 ive shut up about this long enough samantha is using my daughter
8613695 people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay
8613696 lots of tourists want to visit the house i have to tell them to get a partner of the opposite sex in order to get in
8613697 my family finds it regretful that the hong kong government has not done much for my brother i urge them to buy the residence and convert it into a museum
8613698 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8613699 but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing but it was just the best way to go
8613700 many states have moved to doing portfolios where students show what they know rather than taking a test to show what they dont know
8613701 i really want to work on getting into my chosen career
8613702 i was held up for years just trying to get into this profession
8613703 this was something that had really hurt my life or set me back and not just set me back but other students so thats why i decided to fight
8613704 these are the donors who we will need to raise money for sen obama
8613705 youve seen the numbers on the donor side which are nowhere near the potential that could be achieved from the clinton side
8613706 the first time we called the list it was tough the second time was tough but weve gotten some commitments
8613707 right now we have five or six helping after the convention we hope to have many more
8613708 indicate that unity is not just a one way street but a two way street and enable certain people that have not yet been able to become involved to become more fully engaged
8613709 should be the poster child for how clinton donors and obamas finance team get along
8613710 we have a level of trust and history that allows us to do it
8613711 there has been no reaching out no deep gestures of appreciation and respect
8613712 im miffed by this and shes working her heart out for him
8613713 pami o alinie jest pami ci o niej jako aktywnej i wra liwej na krzywd i b l w tym pomaganiu ludziom w nieszcz ciach bardzo si anga owa a
8613714 a few days ago i was speaking to a group and one young lady asked me what do you think dr king would say about
8613715 i think my most emotional moment came the night of south dakota and montana i was thinking about all those times i was telling people be what you want to be when you grow up and hell i didnt believe it its a big moment and with these sorts of things you usually dont expect to see the day
8613716 i dont think it will draw out latent racism because of the characteristics that define barack obama he is not a traditional he is a combo of african american and white i think america is at a place today where it is ready to move knowing that with its population balance shifting it is no longer about dominance by any particular one race
8613717 i think after iowa for the first time a lot of black people said wow this could happen
8613718 the reality is obamas not alone theres a wave of african american leaders who just excite i see in my own city people in their 20s who are just incredible just like the foray of blacks into baseball yeah there was a but after him there were dozens of players who changed the game there are glass ceilings that will be shattered in statehouses and party leadership positions obamas been a game changer
8613719 what this does for so many people of so many people of different colors and strides and stripe and genders is that if barack obama can do it anybody in this country can do it
8613720 i think that while it doesnt mean weve gotten to heaven we are on our way as the old song goes we are on the highway to a racial justice or at least towards eliminating race as a factor for putting people in political office in high places
8613721 its been a spiritual experience for me personally and i think its a spiritual movement that has taken the whole country
8613722 i was born in 1954 and in 1954 we would not be having this conversation so the fact that we have come to a place in our society where there are enough people willing to endorse through their votes financial support and a black male candidate is very significant in terms of how society has evolved
8613723 i dont think anyone looks at and thinks that this guy is speaking for black americans theres a danger that white people will say that the fact that barack obama is president means any black person can be president without any further reform of the system thats a big fear that his success will be used to reduced sympathies for those who did not succeed
8613724 as we mature in the political process we are developing a whole cadre of a new type of politician who wants to appeal more broadly to an entire society theyve got to appeal across the board thats just a sign to me of the maturing of the african american politician in this country
8613725 in spite of the fact that i might disagree ideological or politically i think its helpful for my daughter my 8 year old daughter asked me during my second term when we were getting sworn in she asked me daddy do you have women congressmen so i think there is a psychological benefit it is good to see an african american nominee for major political party now its not going to shock us as much no more than to see the female reporter or black quarterback or black republican or the hispanic head coach
8613726 barack obama is like the first african americans who ran for mayors of major american cities hes an extraordinary candidate
8613727 his candidacy is a reflection of its a fruit of the civil rights movement but the civil rights movement doesnt own him we may co own him we are maybe shareholders in his success
8613728 im 76 years old and i have participated in one aspect of the struggle or another since i was a teenager in high school after i grew up i understood that this wasnt an effort that you accomplished in one lifetime or one great magic movement as we held in the 1950s and 1960s it was long range project you know that you have to keep pushing and you know that you have to keep struggling and you dont know exactly how it will come out but you believe the struggle is worth it because you know there is more decency in the country then the status quo has it well i never back in the 60s i never pushed with the idea that sometime in my lifetime a black person would get to be it never occurred to me
8613729 barack obama has never been a black leader he is a leader that happens to be black he has never carried the black agenda the responsibility for african americans will be as if not more paramount to address these issues than before his campaign began
8613730 the country really has evolved and thats a wonderful thing who would have though four years ago that an african american man could be the nominee of the his nomination means it can happen and will happen likely in our lifetime

8613749 our balance sheet continues to grow stronger each quarter with improving cash flow lower inventory levels and reductions in debt
8613750 you want to have as much trust built with the community as you can so having people who are objective talking about what happened is very helpful
8613751 when we convene a commission or we ask don stern to look at a situation theyre trying to gather information afterwards and we think it would be helpful to be proactive and have people there at the beginning so the information couldnt be questioned
8613752 the public is better served by access to events as they unfold
8613753 even if the military is firmly in charge of pakistans nuclear programme where is the civilian component in decision making
8613754 ultimately there will have to be evidence of a strong civilian oversight for the world to accept that we are moving in to a new and more reassuring phase maybe after president musharraf politicians gain enough clout in time that they become full partners in managing and securing the nuclear programme
8613755 there is no indication that the military does not exercise full control over pakistans nuclear assets
8613756 in my own life nothing that has happened nothing that can happen compares with the strangeness of a single summer

8613763 our primary findings suggested that smoking physical inactivity and obesity are inversely associated with awareness of the psa test these risk behaviors are linked with higher prostate cancer morbidity and mortality
8613764 the results concur with our initial hypothesis that men who adopt unhealthy lifestyles may be less concerned with health and less aware of preventive measures like the psa test
8613765 the mean brain volume in preterm infants with abnormal blood flow distribution was 45 millilitres smaller than in other preterm infants
8613766 we examined tissue samples from preterm placentas and classified them according to the amount of inflammation found in microscopic examinations inflammatory reactions were seen in 45 per cent of the placentas
8613767 a genotype causing strong inflammatory response increases the risk of placental inflammation but on the other hand protects the child against inflammation our preliminary findings suggest that genetic regulation of interleukin 6 is also associated with the volume of the deep gray matter of the brain
8613768 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother

8613773 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8613774 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet
8613775 sometimes loving your country demands you must tell the truth to power
8613776 these are the donors who we will need to raise money for sen obama

8613791 it the rule of law does not mean drivers licenses for illegal aliens nor does it mean that states should be allowed to flout the federal law barring them from giving in state tuition rates to illegal aliens we oppose amnesty
8613792 amnesty has to be an important part of any immigration solution because there are people who have lived in this country for 20 30 or 40 years who have raised children here and pay taxes here and are not citizens that has to be a component of it

8613812 our focus has been lets not worry about whos the starter lets just get both of you ready to play
8613813 well find out a lot about them when we put them in a game situation our goal all along was to get them both ready to win hopefully theyre both ready and we can play with both
8613814 theyre really very similar other than steve is a little taller and nick may run a little faster
8613815 but their skill sets are very similar so were running the same plays with both of them
8613816 youre so worried about do they completely understand its like we have 105 freshmen
8613817 theres the mystery or the curiosity or the unanswered questions
8613818 ive tried not to think or have our players think too much about what has gone on in the past because its really not relevant
8613819 youre going to get butterflies and be nervous if youre not you shouldnt be coaching or playing
8613820 jake was the only guy who we thought was prepared to go into a game and play
8613821 the biggest thing is that he has improved in all phases
8613822 whether you want to talk about him throwing the football or knowing the offense or just being more confident
8613823 he just looks like a guy who belongs on the football field now whereas a year ago i couldnt really say that he has grown and hes a viable candidate
8613824 it was really tough to get a good judgment on jakes ability last year
8613825 its not like we have guys on the shelf that we could just insert
8613826 the kids have a lot of confidence in them but i still dont want to go into the season with the idea youve got a two quarterback or three quarterback system
8613827 i wish i were clairvoyant where i could tell you exactly what is going to happen
8613828 hey just go in there and enjoy it its your club right now go get em
8613829 ill encourage the other two kids hey as soon as i get a chance to get you in there and the opportunity comes up youve got to be ready
8613830 hes going to give us the best chance at least in theory to go out and do what we need to do offensively
8613831 that not only involves preparation but that means managing the game managing the time clock managing the audibles on the line of scrimmage anything we need a quarterback to do he gives us the best option
8613832 allan is pretty good on the decision part of the process
8613833 the part that he struggled with early on was understanding where we wanted the football to go after a first or second read
8613834 we hope that terrelle gets a chance to get into this football game
8613835 typically what we have done at the beginning of nearly every season is that weve tried to have multiple quarterbacks play in the first half we do the same thing with our offensive line just to get their noses bloodied a little
8613836 no question we have a lot of older players we have over 40 guys entering their fourth or fifth year
8613837 certainly we have some name recognition and excellent talent at a lot of positions the key is the phraseology of the watch list now we get to watch and find out if theyre the best
8613838 i think the towns a great town and i like working here
8613839 he is going to a larger department and i think that hes making a good move
8613840 previously addiction to benzodiazepines has been explained by reference to negative rather than positive reinforcement in other words the thinking has been that the reason people continue to use the medicine is that it helps to alleviate their distressing withdrawal symptoms and general discomfort rather than because it provides a sense of reward
8613841 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8613842 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8613843 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8613844 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8613845 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8613846 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8613847 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful protection zones in the wrong place to prevent coral reef collapse
8613848 these new findings have several clinical implications besides the impairment of sexual function in these young men
8613849 the lack of testosterone during these critical years may lead to diminished bone mass and the lack of development or lose of skeletal muscle in addition these patients may gain more weight with an average body mass index of 38 they already were obese and become more insulin resistant
8613850 also patients with low testosterone and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high concentrations of c reactive protein
8613851 which increases their risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease above and beyond the risk associated with diabetes
8613852 while obesity contributes to the association of type 2 diabetes and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism hh the association is not dependent entirely on obesity
8613853 in our first study of diabetic men we found that 31 percent of lean type 2 diabetics also had hh so it is likely that factors other than obesity contribute to hh possibly insulin resistance
8613854 whether obesity or insulin resistance is the major determinant of hh has to be addressed in future studies and the pathogenesis of hh needs to be defined

8613869 in our culture we dont even let girls sit with their male cousins and this guy is a teacher why is this man who has said we are not even allowed to chat with a boy doing this

8613872 within the islamic community the family has such a high status that everyone is worried about compromising ones honor and dignity people are also afraid to give islam a bad name especially in the current climate
8613873 when i talked to the former student we realized it was almost the same story for both of us
8613874 as far as marriage and divorce that has never been there not even islamically not even from the religious point of view
8613875 marriage is just a term that we were using but we were never considering it a marriage really even she knows

8613894 hay que enfrentar de manera diferente esta problem tica que incluso se escapa del manejo de las autoridades por ello es necesario modificar el art culo 34 de la constituci n

8613896 ellos har n la socializaci n para el reasentamiento de la poblaci n impactada
8613897 nos mantuvieron aqu en un empobrecimiento inmenso porque no pod amos hacerle reformas a las casas
8613898 porque yo vivo arrimada en una casa y a mi no me dan casita
8613899 queremos hacer un proyecto altamente participativo y vemos que hay una predisposici n muy positiva
8613900 sabemos que es una comunidad con serios problemas sociales pero de acuerdo con los lineamientos de las empresas del proyecto se buscar mejorar las condiciones de vida
8613901 este proyecto no es solamente un cambio de vivienda para quienes est n en zonas de alto riesgo es un cambio de ciudad
8613902 lo vemos como un proyecto de alto desarrollo tanto para las familias como para la ciudad y el pa s porque nos conectar con urab
8613903 habr acompa amiento persona a persona familia a familia vamos a trabajar de la mano con las organizaciones comunitarias
8613904 espero que esto pueda generar fuentes de empleo y desarrollo para mejorar las condiciones de pobreza extrema de estas comunidades
8613905 son muchos los a os que nos han mantenido en esta incertidumbre y que han tenido esta comunidad empobrecidos a la espera de que ya nos iban a reubicar ahora las cosas ya son reales esto nos va a beneficiar mucho porque podremos tener una mejor calidad de vida

8613907 hay un dicho que tienen los gringos no parking no business aqu no hay parqueaderos no hay negocios y creo que a la administraci n le ha faltado trabajar en ello lo mismo que en la recuperaci n comercial de la zona aqu no se ve la promoci n del cambio
8613908 muchos est n recurriendo a los pagadiarios para pagar deudas lo peor es que eso se convierte en una ruina para muchos

8613915 akash was a great guy the instructors said he showed a lot of enthusiasm
8613916 you would think with how much air space there is what are the chances that two planes would meet in the sky at the same time
8613917 its one of the many aspects we will be looking at communication covers a wide range of issues such as if there was miscommunication misunderstanding and other issues
8613918 por eso en febrero llev al concejo el proyecto de acuerdo 013 con el fin de derogar el ltimo acuerdo el 049 de 2006 que contiene dicha exoneraci n pero lo hundieron con el argumento de que colanta es generadora de empleo
8613919 colanta ha monopolizado el municipio desde que lleg hay una resistencia porque no soy de su equipo pol tico alas equipo colombia la arbitrariedad en los 23 a os ha sido contundente tienen el voto amarrado de los empleados y sus familias
8613920 pero adicionalmente del grupo de 13 hay cuatro concejales que son empleados de colanta y otros tres tienen a sus parientes laborando en esa empresa
8613921 se neg la recusaci n porque el proyecto que el alcalde quiere derogar tiene un car cter general impersonal y abstracto nada tiene que ver el hecho de que estemos vinculados a la empresa no se beneficia a una persona o una empresa en espec fico sino a la comunidad como yo estaba recusado no pod a negarla o aprobarla
8613922 los primeros cuatro concejales son empleados de colanta y los tres ltimos tienen a sus parientes laborando en la empresa o con v nculos en ella as miguel avenda o a su hermano ren luj n a su esposa dora avenda o a un hermano asociado y a su sobrina adri n p rez a su hermano asociado y carlos avenda o a su hermano
8613923 hay una persecuci n pol tica por parte del alcalde hacia los concejales de alas equipo colombia echeverry mar n afirma que teme por su vida
8613924 a veces me llaman a decirme que me cuide hay un ambiente delicado
8613925 l alcalde est confundido y confunde a la comunidad y se neg a contestar si con el dinero que deja de pagar colanta podr an resolverse los problemas financieros del municipio
8613926 primero hay que dejar claro que no debemos un solo peso de impuestos porque hemos sido exonerados es contradictorio e injusto cobrarle ese impuesto a una entidad sin nimo de lucro cuya funci n es servir de regulador de precios nosotros pagamos impuestos al patrimonio tambi n de catastro cumplidamente
8613927 pienso que el se or alcalde no ve las bondades de colanta nosotros transformamos los suelos no s lo de san pedro sino del norte de antioquia qu era el norte hace 25 a os unos helechales hoy son la cuenca lechera m s importante de colombia adem s en san pedro hay 1 100 trabajadores directos
8613928 los concejales socios de colanta no son los due os de la empresa son los 14 mil campesinos y los 4 500 trabajadores decir eso es desconocer las normas de la econom a solidaria los concejales no reciben dividendos y no se benefician ni siquiera pol ticamente
8613929 no se necesitan palabras los hechos lo dicen todo pero yo no voy a juzgar a nadie

8613940 we are trying to elaborate a strong text that will show our determination not to accept what is happening in georgia
8613941 the sco states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the south ossetian issue and urges the sides to solve existing problems peacefully through dialogue and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks
8613942 the presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of respect for historic and cultural traditions of every country and efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity
8613943 placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts
8613944 i am sure that the united position of the sco member states will have international resonance
8613945 and i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression
8613946 we understand the complex history and realities of south ossetia and abkhazia
8613947 at the same time reflecting chinas consistent stance on such issues we hope all the parties can appropriately resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation

8613976 si bien fue un buen semestre esto no implica que lleguemos en la misma condici n a final de a o esto principalmente por el impacto que genera el ipc en la base de remuneraciones de correos de mantenerse la proyecci n que hoy arroja este indicador podemos tener un impacto del orden de los 2 800 millones adicionales por concepto de remuneraciones
8613977 tenemos tambi n un fuerte impacto en los costos asociados al transporte ya que correoschile usa una red de transporte bastante amplia a nivel nacional con m s de 400 m viles y ah nos golpea el precio del petr leo y tambi n el d lar ya este primer semestre llevamos acumulado un gasto adicional de 300 millones en el tema de transporte por lo tanto la proyecci n se hace un tanto m s compleja

8614058 for matt and myself itd be nice knowing what the situation would be and be able to move forward with it the way i look at it more than anything the sooner it can happen the sooner we can get past the interviews and media coverage that goes with it and you can prepare for the game
8614059 we know its getting close and you get that anxiety and excitement knowing the decision has to be made soon i am sure coach understands that and hell make the decision as soon as its necessary
8614060 hopefully well get in enough snaps with the first offensive line that both can play
8614061 i just wanted to make sure kurt gets his timing with the ones for this game much like we did in kansas city
8614062 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8614063 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8614064 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8614065 its going to be exciting to see those guys get in there and make plays
8614066 obviously lelie has been out of practice every day so this is a good start were starting to get something going there so its going to be exciting to see him play
8614067 basically the ship received conflicting information on when it was supposed to arrive in the suez canal
8614068 the global patriots arrival ahead of schedule was a significant contributing factor
8614069 we would like to express our sincere apology and profound sorrow for this tragic accident and extend our to the family of mr mohammed afifi
8614070 we have offered financial assistance to the family realising of course that no amount of money could ever compensate his family for the loss of life
8614071 we are reviewing our operating procedures as we cooperate closely with the government of egypt to ensure that such an incident is not repeated
8614072 i can assure you were going to ensure that all ships arrive at the prescribed time
8614073 egyptian ports are not open to those who want to fire shots
8614074 have the right and duty to protect the ship to avoid incidents such as the
8614075 i would like this all to possibly be resolved within the next couple of weeks
8614076 we need to make progress with that transaction as quickly as we possibly can its for the majority of shareholders to come to a view about how they want the future of that company to be addressed
8614077 we are clear that the edf deal is a good one it will allow us to fast track nuclear development
8614078 mediations seven deadly sins avoiding the seven sure fire ways
8614079 we have received lots of complaints from parents about unnecessary money demands in the various government schools
8614080 the states may be the first place to establish a single payer system
8614081 we need a national nurse to inspire and engage nurses
8614082 ive enjoyed coming back so im now back in the selectors hands

8614086 they the family are a massive part of my life and they always come first and ive been criticised for that but that will never change
8614087 but they are fully 100 percent behind me they said go for it and give it your best shot

8614090 it is a shocking and shameful situation the cardinal told toi here on wednesday while referring to the situation in orissa where nine people were killed and 30 churches and orphanages were attacked recently by alleged vhp activists
8614091 i spoke to sister ramya a nun working in the tribal belt of orissa
8614092 the state government and police have failed to build confidence among the minorities he said adding
8614093 the good image of our country is being destroyed by such incidents he pointed out
8614094 it is inexplicable how the intelligence machinery in orissa was unable to foresee the danger and advise the government to take preventive measures he said
8614095 i would appeal to the people to calm down and not make the situation more volatile
8614096 an attack not just on a community but on the democratic fabric of the nation
8614097 if simi can be banned why not these organisations who are spreading terror
8614098 the hostility towards christians is unimaginable we need to kill this hatred he observed
8614099 as a mark of our solidarity with our christian brothers and sisters who have been victims of this spree of killing arson and devastation in orissa and as a sign of protest against those deliberately stoking incendiary communal passions and creating religious hatred and disharmony i am requesting all our educational institutions and schools to remain closed on friday he said
8614100 the final assault was launched late on wednesday night by the special forces of the army and entire family of the house owner including four children was rescued
8614101 the players view can be really simple if i get paid for two extra games ill play two more games
8614102 the fans view is more of the real stuff is better the realistic view is its a way to generate more revenues
8614103 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8614104 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american
8614105 focus on what is happening now and not what should have been done for decades
8614106 social issues that are not in a single delegates control
8614107 other studies mostly just look at one aspect the carbon capture
8614108 this is a first step in trying to quantify the environmental trade offs
8614109 we are not spending one dollar on research and development for compact fluorescents
8614110 previous research has shown that a childs risk of developing asthma is lower if he or she is exposed to bacteria in early life
8614111 its not a question of whether or not well use the natural gas under lake erie were already doing that
8614112 its a question of whether we control our own destiny and harvest our own energy assets to our benefit or continue to leave energy resources in the hands of others
8614113 this recommendation is not a recommendation by the task force that a new nuclear power plant be built
8614114 the beneficiary of some 100 billion in direct and indirect subsidies since 1948
8614115 a federal regulation that continues to have a cost reducing effect on the nuclear power industry
8614116 youve got to say right heres the line in the sand were going to stop it here because its madness to continue
8614117 it doesnt paint a very good picture of the future for carbon emissions but there is no other real choice coal is one of the few fuel sources which has a real capacity to expand
8614118 i dont think in my lifetime i will ever see more than 50 percent of the coal fired plants in china being fitted with ccs
8614119 the companies agreed to reduce this carcinogenic chemical in fried potatoes a victory for public health and safety in california
8614120 other companies should follow this lead and take steps to reduce acrylamide in french fries and potato chips
8614121 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8614122 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8614123 the government has known about this for a very long time but has just refused to face up to it
8614124 there is no way the government can hope to achieve any of its emissions targets without cheating unless it changes its policies on encouraging flying and hoping to satisfy peoples insatiable demands for buying more and more stuff
8614125 the issue of the potential impacts of global warming on recreation and the recreation industry
8614126 i dont want to comment on anything now let there be an official announcement
8614127 the business has performed very well in the first half of 2008 despite a deteriorating global financial and economic background and these uncertainties remain
8614128 in the last few months the industry has reported early indications of weakening growth in some markets
8614129 if lebanon becomes a hezbollah state then we wont have any restrictions
8614130 no sales or supply of arms and related materiel to lebanon except as authorized by its government
8614131 coalition forces picked up two suspected associates of the kataib hezbollah criminal network during operations this morning in baghdads new baghdad district military officials reported during a teleconference with bloggers and internet journalists acting on intelligence tips coalition forces raided the home of a suspected kataib hezbollah propaganda expert who is believed to have uploaded more than 30 attack videos to the criminal rings now defunct web site coalition forces entered the house where they detained two of the wanted mans brothers who are believed to be involved in his criminal enterprises coalition forces have detained more than 15 suspected members of kataib hezbollah in the last two months officials said kataib hezbollah is reported to receive funding logistics and weapons such as improvised rocket assisted mortars from iran the group also is believed to receive guidance or direction from the quds force of the iranian revolutionary guard corps
8614132 but knowing that it happened because of water on the track and for reasons completely out of our own control was even more upsetting after not finishing at daytona and then at california it was just frustrating for myself and the entire team
8614133 no one wants to start a season like that hopefully the weather will stay away from the track this weekend and we get a chance to see what the no 5 chevy can really do out there
8614134 we had a lot of rain in the area that weekend a lot
8614135 the track kept seeping water in certain areas when the race finally started that evening there were a lot of complaints from drivers about the tracks condition so we were aware of the issue we just got in the wrong place on the track
8614136 theres not much control you have over the car when it hits water like that that was just an extremely unfortunate day for all of us
8614137 theres just very little left for them to attack in other areas
8614138 has a responsibility to ensure adequate funding is provided to ensure teachers can do a good job
8614139 weve increased funding to our schools by 52 per cent during the life of our government
8614140 but people always expect us to spend taxpayer funds in the most efficient way possible so were always trying to economise in the way we use taxpayers dollars but the critical thing is we just get more service
8614141 what were seeing is that the money is not going back into our schools its going into treasurys coffers
8614142 were very comfortable with the changes we support the broad direction of the reforms
8614143 the economics are counter intuitive temporarily restrict supply to increase uptake
8614144 this is not what we wanted to find but it has been our solid experience over two years and is a known paradox in economics
8614145 given that wikileaks needs to restrict supply for a period to increase perceived value to the point that journalists will invest time to produce quality stories the question arises as to which method should be employed to apportion material to those who are most likely to invest in it
8614146 i hope it works out and its not a mess it should be fun coming out with the block o itll be cool well see how it works out hopefully we dont take out any band members
8614147 last week when we lost our video photographer shawn coin to a tragic death the first person to call me was my brother to offer his condolences the second was coach jim tressel

8614149 i dont know what to think seems like no mans lifes worth anything anymore
8614150 we can already see progress traffic has increased as there are a lot of trucks and even cars transporting people
8614151 there is a possibility of a second filling station to cater for the increasing volume of traffic especially big trucks transporting cargo
8614152 none of the 10 owners have developed their erven so far and we are in the process of getting legal help to trace these people
8614153 let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless in facing them let me not beg for the stilling of my pain but for the heart to conquer it

8614161 if god could have that little squirrel fall out of a tree onto our driveway and not get hurt and if the cat could have him in his jaws and he not get eaten and if he landed in my yard where god knew i would take him to the vet can you imagine how much god loves that little squirrel can you imagine and if he loves that little squirrel that much can you imagine how much he loves you and will take care of you
8614162 most of us you see think of god as a god of the gaps we dont intend to but we do having been educated in the west there is a deistic twist to our thinking causing us to view a tree as growing by natural laws we fail to see god everywhere god pulling and shaping each leaf each blade of grass even though we may subscribe in general to the notion we are affected by our knowledge of science the god of the bible runs everything he created nature and supernature which are actually all of a piece with no division between them nothing in nature works by itself god works it

8614166 i am glad to be back after a decade i really feel vindicated i feel great
8614167 anwar whatever we think of him and many of us are deeply skeptical is looking more and more like our future prime minister
8614168 there is a mounting sense of inevitability to his impending succession
8614169 we have walked out because they have refused to respond
8614170 so theres no point in staying and participating in this debate
8614171 there will be more media interest in hull city than ever before but we have put down a marker that our coverage will be better and more comprehensive than you can get anywhere else
8614172 this administration is not just anti abortion when it comes down to it theyre really anti sex anti women in every possible way imagine not being able tell someone about contraception that is a rule that in the united states of america that the president has proposed we need a change my sisters we really do they are after us they are after our bodies they are after controlling our lives
8614173 hes always been against reproductive rights for women hes not for equal pay he did not support lilly ledbetter and the work that were trying to do to get equal pay he never supported the family and medical leave act in congress so theres no evidence hes not with us
8614174 restores the longstanding interpretation of title vii of the civil rights act
8614175 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8614176 they need the education and training particularly since more and more women are heads of their households as much or more than anybody else
8614177 and its hard for them to leave their families when they dont have somebody to take care of them
8614178 reducing health inequities is an ethical imperative social injustice is killing people on a grand scale
8614179 there is no good biological reason why this should be the case
8614180 these health inequalities are preventable they arise from the circumstances in which people are born grow live work and age the social determinants of health
8614181 taking action to deal with preventable causes of illness means taking social action a toxic combination of poor social policies unfair economic arrangements and bad politics is responsible
8614182 the commission considers health care a common good not a market commodity
8614183 the commission advocates financing the health care system through general taxation and or mandatory universal insurance the evidence is compellingly in favour of a publicly funded health care system
8614184 we are distressed by the reports we see of healthcare simply being unavailable to people because of inability to pay and we see that throughout lower and middle income countries
8614185 not for me to tell one of the richest countries on earth how it should organise its health care system
8614186 its not perhaps the best use of money thats being spent there are a lot of people who feel that and would actually like to see coming out of the current presidential campaign in the us proposals for a universal health insurance
8614187 we will expand our line up of products with displays at 40 inches or larger as demand for them is on the rise
8614188 bernard is something we wanted to add vertical speed and playmaking after the catch
8614189 besides randy moss he was the next best vertical guy on the market so it was taking a good player from a division rival we were willing to go out and get him
8614190 hes a lot tougher than i gave him credit for
8614191 certainly he is a talented guy who can stretch the field but he has a good feel for shallow crosses and slants too
8614192 before free agency spielman consulted with vikings defensive coordinator leslie frazier he asked frazier if he had to adjust the vikings scheme for berrian when they played the bears the answer was yes vikings opponents will be more reluctant to adjust their schemes for berrian because of the presence of rookie of the year running back adrian peterson
8614193 there is no nato naval build up in the black sea as russian authorities are claiming in the media
8614194 this deployment is routine in nature and has been planned for over a year notification of the requirement to transit the turkish straits was given in june well before the current georgia crisis and is completely unrelated
8614195 we are trying to draw up a strong text showing our desire not to accept

8614197 the sco member states express their deep concern over the recent tensions surrounding the south ossetia question and call for the sides to peacefully resolve existing problems through dialogue
8614198 the presidents confirmed their commitment to the principle of respecting the historical and cultural traditions of each country and efforts aimed at maintaining the unity of states and their territorial integrity
8614199 i am sure that the united position of the sco member states will have international resonance
8614200 and i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression
8614201 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia

8614208 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8614209 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8614210 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8614211 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind

8614261 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder

8614330 and finally christian conservatives are flummoxed by a problem inherent in conservatism itself as a political philosophy it succeeded only because it was predicated upon a culture that still honored the divine order but when that divine order and its articulation of natural law is decisively ignored as has happened in the west then conservatism is shown to be profoundly incomplete it cannot stand as a political philosophy because it relied upon the tacit understandings of natural law to undergird it without that bedrock which has been eroded away the structure of conservatism has toppled and its ruins are populated by genial ghosts like patrick buchanan and mangy louse ridden temple cats like rush limbaugh

8614336 kurtzs argument which oreilly embraces is that when legal rights are accorded to gays through some unspecified process heterosexual couples begin bearing children out of wedlock and refuse to marry when they otherwise would there are many government policies that alter the incentives to get and stay married and thus have direct and unsurprising effects on marriage for instance the availability of no fault divorce leads to more divorces and laws providing the same rights for cohabitating heterosexual couples as married couples lead to fewer marriages as couples make private commitments to each other without seeking the imprimatur of the state but neither kurtz nor oreilly has provided a plausible justification for their belief that extending rights to gay couples harms heterosexual marriage

8614340 i think the vote of no confidence in lawrence summers is a wonderful thing harvard continues to discredit itself with the american public the faculty is trapped if summers resigns this extraordinary example of political correctness will come back to haunt harvard and the entire academy for years but if summers hangs on the faculty itself will have been humiliated checked by the very fact of public scrutiny either way harvard is tearing itself apart so long as the public simply writes of the academy the mice can play but the intense public scrutiny in this case puts the captains of political correctness into a no win situation like the closely watched susan estrich fiasco this battle is doing lasting damage to the cultural left as they say sunlight is the best disinfectant

8614370 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8614371 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the north pole area right now is covered with very thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8614372 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8614373 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the arctic ocean in summer by 2030 or so
8614374 as it turns out our partners are choosing the latter
8614375 this has led directly to a similarly significant increase in monetizable partner inventory as our video id partners are seeing claimed content more than double their number of views against which we can run ads

8614388 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
8614389 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine

8614407 as time went on and people learned about barack obama we began to believe that the u s would truly elect a president based on substance and not on race

8614585 the bulk of obamas tax increases on the wealthy about 500 000 of that 800 000 would simply take away bushs tax cuts the remaining 300 000 wouldnt nearly reverse their pretax income gains in recent years

8614610 it is too early to predict the 2009 situation but seed companies are going into the next sales season knowing european maize seed stocks are at an all time low and demand is likely to be the highest ever limagrain uk as the company will be known here will be better placed than many to supply farmers with a range of maize varieties suitable for most uk growing conditions
8614611 the uk is at the extreme of the geographic range for maize however limagrain uk intend to accelerate breeding improvements and deliver varieties that are early cold tolerant high in starch and highly digestible

8614613 im confident that with an obama presidency we will have comprehensive immigration reform in the first term but its not going to be easy
8614614 an important part of the answer is not to have so many people who do not have legal status
8614615 whole detention system that is wrong and causing lots of suffering
8614616 although desirable i think it would be difficult to include fixing the detention and immigration judicial system in comprehensive immigration reform because it really wasnt a critical part of what came about last time
8614617 it doesnt mean that it shouldnt get done im just not sure if thats the best vehicle for it if the goal is to include these issues in comprehensive immigration reform then we have lots of work to do to make them front and center in this debate
8614618 we knew the senate bill was deeply flawed but we believed the legalization component for the 12 million immigrants was decent and the family reunification provisions could be fixed before the final passage
8614619 we cant wait any more when it comes to demilitarizing and improving enforcement and detention

8614621 you dont have to answer it do you think the fact that biden began life stuttering causes him to compensate by talking a lot
8614622 he picked himself up he worked harder than the other guys
8614623 when i first started my job as a u s senator
8614624 while those who knew me knew i stuttered i was reluctant to be nationally identified with it
8614625 in my anger i got up and did something i never thought id ever do

8614628 i spent a fair amount of time learning how to physically handle myself
8614629 because you can make fun of me but you better prepare to fight me
8614630 the reason i dont stutter anymore is i went to a high school that had twice a week public speaking class everyone had to take
8614631 who will be embraced and believed in who as adults will still stutter and might stutter severely and can still be successful speakers and lawyers and professionals
8614632 thats what i was trying to say dont measure success based upon the degree to which you conquer or meet the standard you think you want to meet to be able to communicate verbally

8614740 i told the president if we want to reach a solution with israel it should be a comprehensive one

8614743 today is the beginning of our gandhian movement to seek income tax exemption at par with sikkimese subject holders
8614744 yesterday we submitted our memorandum to the governor chief minister chief secretary and finance secretary seeking their intervention
8614745 we have stressed that the chief minister has been repeatedly been assuring that the old settlers residing in sikkim before the merger date have been left out of exemption from income tax and that they too would now be given the same benefits under ladakh model in consultation with the union government
8614746 we have drawn the attention of the union finance minster to the difficulties that would be faced in compliance of direct taxes in sikkim if made applicable retrospectively from april 1 2007
8614747 hence the act should not be implemented at once and proper time period should be given to those settled after merger date to be fully prepared the act should be made applicable prospectively from a later date after an extensive awareness campaign is conducted to prepare the people mentally for a smooth and meaningful implementation

8614753 simba attacked one of the ladys dogs that was fostering her so her husband took her to the bedford animal shelter she was put in as an owner
8614754 the shelter will keep her until saturday at 2p m this is a dog with a wonderful side but has shown aggression to other dogs in the household shes fine with other dogs when you are walking her and she has not shown aggression to humans this is such a sad case the question mark is her past we dont know if this behavior can be trained out or not a different breed say no one has responded to earlier pleas to help scuba the dog once saved from drowning in a pool behind an abandoned dallas home we havent had any response to our prior e mail and his time is running out
8614755 his current foster has given us until the end of the week to find him a new home or else he is heading back to the city shelter unfortunately adb does not have the funds to board him
8614756 a wonderful dog great with adults children and other dogs his only issue is that hes cat aggressive
8614757 she is house trained utd on all vaccinations and is very healthy shes been the only dog for 3 years but has been around other dogs and gets along with them as you can imagine shes pretty out of place right now
8614758 she came into the shelter on july 29 the staff has kept her as long as they can and she is likely to be next in line for euthanasia
8614759 isnt that a great face i can imagine her in an obedience class with that studious look leaving the other students in her doggy dust im pretty sure she can country western dance pretty well too just like her namesake from urban cowboy
8614760 scared to death in the shelter he just lays out and wont even come to you but once you get him outside he is so grateful and so happy

8614893 from there obama moved the conversation toward a discussion of how the government could improve the nations infrastructure its backbone of bridges roads tunnels airports and the like much of which has seen better days
8614894 as any chicago school economist would remind you the federal government has made its share of mistakes in this area a recent example being subsidies for ethanol which obama a farm state senator has championed and mccain has opposed but obama at least seems to have learned one lesson from the experience his proposed new infrastructure spending would be overseen by a bipartisan board of unelected officials rather than members of congress

8614911 while there are some notable exceptions many entrepreneurs still see environmental initiatives as representing a cost to the business rather than an opportunity
8614912 the reality is that there are two broad reasons why entrepreneurs should have green issues firmly on their agenda
8614913 firstly environmental factors are increasingly influencing the buying decisions of both businesses and consumers secondly the growing pressure on businesses and individuals to reduce their environmental impact inevitably brings opportunities for new products and services to help them meet this goal
8614914 it is disgraceful that border patrol agents are put in harms way and our government doesnt do everything reasonably within its power to protect us from marauding mexican soldiers and others
8614915 without a forceful response to these illegal incursions an agent will eventually be seriously wounded or killed it is only a matter of time
8614916 the incursions will not stop until the mexican military units and their commanders are held accountable for their actions
8614917 it is a documented fact that the mexican military is corrupt and is involved in protecting drug cartels smugglers and other criminals
8614918 there is an international boundary for a reason and they are to be respected by both governments
8614919 we take very seriously our role in working with our international neighbors to address and resolve these situations
8614920 the fact that the mexican military is operating in such close proximity to the border without any identifiable purpose calls into question its activities and raises concerns about the vulnerability of our southern land border
8614921 when considering the frequency of incursions and the threat these encounters pose to our border patrol agents it is critical that we take the necessary steps to ensure that mexican military and law enforcement personnel do not cross into the u s without our knowledge or consent
8614922 will result in a clearer delineation of the international border
8614923 a reasonable person would conclude that the soldiers knew exactly at whom they were pointing their rifles
8614924 had the agent panicked and fired a shot or attempted to flee in his vehicle there is little doubt the mexican soldiers would have opened fire
8614925 during past incursions the mexican government has denied it had soldiers in the area they have blamed impostors even when military humvees were involved
8614926 time after time they have gotten away with these incursions and time after time our government has not taken a forceful stand against them
8614927 to address the incursion and limit or prevent the likelihood of similar incidents in the future
8614928 we in this country are perilously close to the end the concluding event of a long line of corrections at gods hand will be nuclear destruction

8614937 rex has apologised to sara and darnell understands that his behaviour was not acceptable
8614938 nationwide is usually conservative in its predictions of house price falls so when it tells us there is a big fall we know something very serious is happening
8614939 all the signs are that we are at the beginning and not the end of a very painful process
8614940 while the pace of monthly falls picked up during the month the less volatile three month on three month measure eased very slightly in august to 4 5 per cent from 4 6 per cent in july
8614941 house builders in particular have been reporting significant reductions in site visits and reservations of new properties since this time last year in spite of a big increase in the use of sales incentives
8614942 house builders report that a lack of confidence in the market is the biggest reason behind the drop off in demand although changes in lending criteria are also reported as an issue
8614943 we expect the next move in the bank rate to be down but the extent to which this will revive the mortgage and housing market is likely to be limited while overall confidence in economic and housing market conditions is low
8614944 this is common global practice and would enable the company to enhance its financial flexibility as the company builds its exploration and production portfolio

8614978 gsk is looking forward to working with valeant to provide important medicines like retigabine to the medical community and to the patients we serve
8614979 there is a significant need for novel anti epileptic drugs as almost one third of patients with epilepsy continue to experience seizures despite treatment with currently available medications we believe that retigabine could potentially play a significant role in improving the management of epilepsy and is a welcome addition to gsks portfolio
8614980 we were pleased with the significant interest shown in retigabine and we have selected gsk as a collaborator because we believe they are ideally suited and strongly committed to the continued development of this important compound
8614981 gsks development expertise and strong commercial infrastructure will be critical to maximising the worldwide potential of retigabine we believe this collaboration will strengthen our ability to bring this medicine to patients suffering from epilepsy and a variety of other conditions

8615089 the study results show that current australian guidelines for prescribing antibiotics for pneumonia are appropriate dr charles said
8615090 it shows that australian doctors should resist the push which is occurring in some parts of the world particularly the us to prescribe broad spectrum antibiotics to treat essentially all possible causes
8615091 the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens is one of the biggest threats to australian health care standards and is closely linked to the inappropriate use of antibiotics dr charles said
8615092 by continuing to use more traditional antibiotics to treat most cases of pneumonia australian doctors can limit or delay the emergence of more resistant strains of bacteria
8615093 by using the broad spectrum antibiotics less often we can also prolong the effective lifespan of these drugs
8615094 furthermore in the us canada and some parts of europe they are seeing some serious complications which appear to be related to the overuse of some classes of broad spectrum antibiotics that are frequently used there to treat respiratory infections

8615150 i imagine people will be writing that we have a good chance but we wont win anything because we cant compete with the best sides on the day
8615151 we put ourselves in a really good position to be able to win we genuinely felt that and then to lose against leicester at home you cant expect to win trophies if you cant win those games
8615152 it was the semi final and if we had won that it would have been a final against wasps but it was literally the end of our season after losing that game
8615153 we knew if we lost it was over but there was still a shell shocked feeling surrounding it all we all felt stunned
8615154 it has taken a long time to get over it and that doesnt mean we are all over it now it wasnt an easy defeat to take
8615155 i know it is pointing out the obvious but we have got to learn from it that is vital
8615156 we did things in that leicester game we hadnt done all season
8615157 it is such small lines between the whole success and failure thing we all know that and what happened at the end of last season has reinforced it even more

8615223 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8615224 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8615225 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8615226 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8615227 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8615228 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal

8615267 just a moment ago history was made by this party for the first time an african american is the nominee of a major political party they went through the roll call and then they went to new york and it was up to hillary clinton to move to make the nomination unanimous
8615268 madame secretary on behalf of the great state of new york with appreciation for the spirit and dedication of all who are gathered here with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8615269 a remarkable achievement in what has been a remarkable ascendance
8615270 it was a scripted scenario the outcome never in doubt but when history arrived on the floor of the democratic national convention on wednesday afternoon it came with the full force of emotion
8615271 was the climax of a campaign that intertwined two groups that have spent much of the past 50 years struggling for their place at the table of american politics blacks and women and it came at the hands of the woman who had tried so hard to wrest it from him
8615272 joyous scene on the convention floor as delegates danced to the strains of love train and then broke out in chants of yes we can yes we can when the music finally stopped
8615273 immense pride and wonderment at the thought of obama accepting the nomination coupled with a keen awareness that for many of their fellow democrats beating sen john mccain is the priority the black delegates said that they share that goal with no less intensity but that on this day they could not help but pause to reflect on the history being made
8615274 the case that the senator from illinois is ready to be commander in chief
8615275 his choice of running mate even if it was not his wife
8615276 after months of distance and friction with the obama campaign clinton took the stage to perhaps the longest most sustained applause yet in the three day old convention
8615277 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8615278 directly addressed the issue on which his wife had hit mr obama hardest during the primaries and on which republicans have pounded all summer mr obamas experience
8615279 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8615280 whether you love bill clinton or are on the opposing side on the campaign what you saw there tonight was the gift that so frustrated republicans and made democrats so happy
8615281 at first it seemed it might be all about bill clinton and yesteryear
8615282 it is the most repetitive theme of clintons political life that he always finds a path to redemption when he is down and in many ways he proved that again with this speech
8615283 an effort to fully close out the lingering animosity from the primary season
8615284 he gave the best argument offered thus far on the third day of the convention for barack obama he gave a comprehensive view domestically and internationally it wasnt his endorsement tonight that mattered but what he did do is he set a theme restoring the american dream at home and americas leadership abroad
8615285 i thought the master has arrived crazy bill the red faced rageaholic was somewhere else this was deft political pro bill doing what no one had been able to do up to this point at the convention and that is make the case for barack obama
8615286 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8615287 give his nomination address in an outdoor stadium in front of 75 000 people members of both parties saw it as an inspired stroke of campaign image making
8615288 he landed here on wednesday and prepared to become the first presidential candidate in nearly 50 years to accept his partys nomination on such a big stage the plan seemed as much risky as bold
8615289 has been mocking the setting of obamas speech he is delivering it on the 50 yard line at invesco field home of the denver broncos as well as the stage set which the mccain team labeled the temple of obama
8615290 as a fatuous celebrity not ready to be commander in chief
8615291 in the latest installment of its audacity watch series of press releases on obama
8615292 has gambled on the historic moment by creating a stage that will magnify his performance
8615293 senior democratic officials are expressing serious concerns about the political risks posed by barack obamas acceptance speech at invesco field at mile high stadium thursday evening
8615294 the obama campaign is engaging in a high risk endeavor in an uncontrollable environment
8615295 could cancel out any effort to strike a chord with voters angry at republicans but unsure whether obama is a candidate of substance and not just as republicans have said a celebrity short on experience and ability
8615296 how he differs from john mccain and portraying his republican rival as out of touch
8615297 wont hesitate to express his views on president bush and mccain
8615298 he is going to make a case about the choices that people face he is going to make a respectful argument but i dont think he will shy away from making those contrasts where they are appropriate
8615299 had substantially finished the text but would probably continue to edit it right up until he delivers it thursday night
8615300 said obama had looked to past nominating speeches as models including bill clintons in 1992 ronald reagans in 1980 and john f kennedys in 1960
8615301 when obama speaks tonight the words will be largely his own a personal message to americans about the choice they will make in november
8615302 he knows what he wants and he generally says it better than anybody could
8615303 just one election away from the white house his virtuosity his seriousness his ability to inspire his seeming immunity from the strains that afflict others may be among his biggest obstacles to getting there
8615304 little about him that feels spontaneous or unpolished and many americans say they do not feel they know him
8615305 can seem far removed from the troubles of some voters
8615306 was nominated for vice president wednesday night and declared that the challenges america faces require more than a good soldier in the white house hailing barack obama as a wise leader who can deliver the change the nation needs in a single sentence obamas new running mate complimented john mccains years of military service and slapped his claim on the presidency
8615307 made an unannounced appearance with biden on the convention podium after the vice presidential nominee addressed the convention the presidential nominee said he was so proud to have biden on the ticket
8615308 offered a hint of the pit bull role he will likely play in the fall campaign
8615309 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8615310 when bidens brother and son wanted to buy a hedge fund company two years ago they turned for financing to a law firm that had lobbied the delaware senators office on an important piece of business in congress and in fact had recently benefited from his vote the firm promised james and hunter biden that it would invest 2 million and quickly delivered half of it
8615311 deal eventually fell through and the money was returned but it highlighted the close ties that joe biden and his family have developed with simmonscooper an illinois law firm that specializes in asbestos litigation a multimillion dollar line of business that was under threat in congress
8615312 has made about the arizona senator during the democratic presidential primary and in previous years in an attempt to pre emptively undermine his attacks
8615313 are pointing out the numerous times biden has expressed great admiration for mccain calling him one of my heroes on the senate floor nearly a year ago and at another point telling comedy centrals the daily show that he would be honored to run for president on the same ticket as mccain
8615314 has chosen his running mate and the person will be notified on thursday a senior campaign official said
8615315 had pretty much settled on his selection early this week and it crystallized in the past few days campaign manager rick davis flew to mccains cabin in sedona ariz a few days ago to confer and another meeting about the choice was held with top aides wednesday
8615316 the two believed to be under the most serious consideration minnesota gov tim pawlenty and former massachusetts gov mitt romney used humor to dodge repeated questions
8615317 is known only to his small inner circle of advisers no more than three or four people who have refused all public discussion on the matter
8615318 over alleged ties to controversial figures from chicago developer antoin tony rezko to former radical william ayers senior advisers to mccain say he and his surrogates will turn up the heat on obama by raising pointed questions about the propriety of a real estate deal involving obama and rezko
8615319 will hand over responsibility for the security of anbar province once a stronghold of the sunni insurgency and one of the most violent regions in iraq to the iraqi government as early as monday iraqi and american officials said wednesday
8615320 turnover would be a milestone for american officials who have said that reduced violence in the western province shows that a partnership there with the local forces known as awakening councils has been successful
8615321 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
8615322 remains a dangerous place but the ever growing ability of the iraqi security forces continues to move us closer to seeing iraqi control of the province
8615323 turnaround in anbar is all the more dramatic for what it might mean for afghanistan
8615324 make it likely that a us buildup in afghanistan will follow a drawdown in iraq
8615325 made a strong pitch to send thousands of additional marines or other us troops to afghanistan voicing agreement with us commanders there who have said for years that they have too small a force and have called for as many as 10 000 more troops
8615326 marine units in the united states are stepping up their mountain training in preparation for a possible afghanistan mission conway said
8615327 militant shiite leader muqtada al sadr plans to make a series of short visits to iraq starting within weeks but has decided to make iran his home base for years to come a key aide says
8615328 aide spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not supposed to discuss the subject he is close to the 35 year old cleric and has accurately reported on the sadrist movement for several years the aide would not say how long mr al sadr would stay in iran where he has lived since may 2007 but said it was reasonable to expect he would remain there for five or more years
8615329 iraqs oil minister has revived a big oil deal first negotiated between china and the government of saddam hussein but has indicated that the terms of the contract will be far less generous
8615330 if finalised the deal with china national petroleum corp to develop al ahdab oilfield would mark the first important commitment to iraq by a foreign company since the country nationalised its industry in 1972
8615331 the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff secretly convened a highly unusual meeting of senior american and pakistani commanders on an aircraft carrier in the indian ocean on tuesday to discuss how to combat the escalating violence along the border between pakistan and afghanistan
8615332 offered few details on wednesday about what was decided or even discussed at the meeting including any new strategies tactics weapons or troop deployments the star studded list of participants and the extreme secrecy surrounding the talks underscored how gravely both nations regard the growing militant threat

8615631 live positively drink responsibly making informed decisions around alcohol and sex
8615632 available data from southern africa where hiv is most prevalent show that up to 50 of persons living in the region report current alcohol use alcohol serving establishments such as informal drinking places and shebeens often serve as high risk venues for hiv transmission according to a recent survey conducted by health clinics in south africa these results indicate an urgent need for multi level hiv prevention interventions targeting shebeens and the men and women who drink in these settings
8615633 when one drinks too much one is more likely to engage in sexual activities with someone whose hiv status you do not know much about one is also more likely not to use a condom during sex or may not be able to remember where they put the condoms it is best to stay in control and never make decisions about sexual activities when you are drinking alcohol
8615634 drinking too much alcohol weakens the immune system a weaker immune system will have a hard time fighting off common infections such as a cold as well as aids related infections a weaker immune system also increases the chance that you will experience more side effects from your hiv medication

8615645 the established process for standing controllers down after an incident of that type was not followed
8615646 the consensus in the room was that expediency had taken precedence over the established procedure
8615647 both controllers were removed from from the console and discussed the matter with the traffic manager and the check and standardisation supervisor it was assessed that the controllers responded appropriately to correct the situation and the controllers therefore resumed normal duties
8615648 the staffing shortage is the root cause of these problems whether it be closures of airspace or an inability to stand people down

8615653 efforts of the two countries had in the field of cooperation have registered positive progress

8615655 selfless assistance by the chinese government over the past years and hopes to expand such friendly cooperation in all areas
8615656 chinas cooperation and investment in africa cannot be labelled as
8615657 we african people welcome chinese goods because they are both affordable and reliable we hope more small and medium sized chinese enterprises come to invest in cameroon so that more people can be benefited that such cooperation will not only bring the investment but also technical expertise so that african people can learn to rely on themselves eventually
8615658 taken unawares as chinese traders flooded the streets with what they call
8615659 we used to buy goods from nigeria ghana and other african countries that produce solid goods but now the business seems to be falling since most of our customers rush for the cheaper goods
8615660 chinese products are very unreliable and risky when it comes to electrical appliances this poses a threat to technicians
8615661 i think the cameroon government should invest in the local production industry or better still lay complaints to the chinese government for them to improve on the quality of these goods even if it means increasing the prices

8615670 weve increased funding to our schools by 52 per cent during the life of our government
8615671 but people always expect us to spend taxpayer funds in the most efficient way possible so were always trying to economise in the way we use taxpayers dollars but the critical thing is we just get more service

8615717 the commission considers health care a common good not a market commodity
8615718 the commission advocates financing the health care system through general taxation and or mandatory universal insurance the evidence is compellingly in favour of a publicly funded health care system

8615779 tremendous efforts have been devoted to improve our understanding of the anthropogenic effects on the atmospheric temperature change in comparison little has been done in the study of the human impacts on the subsurface thermal environment the objective of this study is to analyze surface air temperature records and borehole subsurface temperature records for a better understanding of the urban heat island effects across the ground surface the annual surface air temperature time series from six meteorological stations and six deep borehole temperature profiles of high qualities show that osaka has been undergoing excess warming since late 19th century the mean warming rate in osaka surface air temperature is about 2 0 c 100a over the period from 1883 to 2006 at least half of which can be attributed to the urban heat island effects however this surface air temperature warming is not as strong as the ground warming recorded in the subsurface temperature profiles the surface temperature anomaly from the osaka meteorological record can only account for part of the temperature anomaly recorded in the borehole temperature profiles surface air temperature is conventionally measured around1 5 m above the ground whereas borehole temperatures are measured from rocks in the subsurface heat conduction in the subsurface is much less efficient than the heat convection of the air above the ground surface therefore the anthropogenic thermal impacts on the subsurface can be more persistent and profound than the impacts on the atmosphere this study suggests that the surface air temperature records alone might underestimate the full extent of urban heat island effects on the subsurface environment
8615780 the osaka station shows a warming trend of 1 99 c 100a over the 124 year period from 1883 to 2006 more than triple the 20th century global warming rate 0 6 c 100a ipcc 2001 the anomalous urban warming is consistently recorded in the records from the nearby urban suburban stations of which the warming rates are 2 24 c 100a for kyoto 1 45 c 100a for kobe and 1 96 c 100a for nara respectively in comparison the warming rates recorded in the two rural stations are more diverse over its 55 year life span the tsurugisan station showed a warming rate of 0 47 c 100a which is slightly lower than the global average whereas the 82 year ibukiyama record showed a 1 60 c 100a warming rate that is much greater than the global average
8615781 the jma jma 2006 cautions that its regional estimate might be not entirely free of urbanization perturbation based on the records from the urban stations around osaka and the jma regional estimate a conservative estimate of the urban heat island effects in osaka would be in the range of 1 2 c 100a this estimate agrees in general with the early analysis of kato 1996 based on principal component score analysis of monthly mean temperature data for the period from 1920 to 1992 from 51 meteorological stations in japan kato suggests that the maximum urban effects with a population of over 100 000 in 1993 were 1 0 2 5 c 100a in japan kato 1996

8615876 with respondents selecting phelps bolt and the chinese mens gymnastics team it illustrates that the best are recognised internationally especially when their efforts result in outstanding unprecedented performances with a touch of the drama
8615877 the chinese people give credit where credit is due and know quality when they see it this is also reflected in their support for jamaica 30 of respondents nominated this island nation as the one that had excelled the most in the games other than china
8615878 while jamaica was not even top 10 on the medal table that nations achievements specifically those of usain bolt has clearly captured the imagination of chinese sporting fans not surprisingly 44 chose the united states as the highest achiever other than china great britains vastly improved efforts did not go unnoticed either with 12 of respondents giving that team the nod for best overall achievement
8615879 the sportswear brands are top of mind perhaps because they create uplifting advertising and definitely because their logos are all over olympic athletes li ning is already a household name in china and the brands logo was emblazoned on many olympic teams outfits seeing li ning recognised as a sponsor of the olympics was not surprising however it was probably the show stopping torch relay finale with li ning in the spotlight high on the wires which won li ning the pole position among local brands sponsoring the olympics this was celebrity attraction and inadvertent ambush marketing at its best
8615880 the impact of these games on the chinese psyche is more emotional than practical truly a milestone in chinas relationship with the rest of the world
8615881 the chinese are also very aware of the home town crowd advantage as we found that 46 of respondents do not think that china will do as well in london 2012 while 29 expect china to do the same in 2012 as they did in 2008 and a quarter of all respondents are expecting an even bigger medal haul in london
8615882 of course they may be caught up in olympics fever but a massive 21 of respondents even said they would consider going to the olympic games in london in 2012

8615990 we owe it to ourselves and to everyone who is associated with australian rugby to make the most of that opportunity

8616035 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
8616036 the democratic party also strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
8616037 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs

8616039 we have made progress the supreme court had upheld prohibitions against the barbaric practice of partial birth abortion the born alive infants protection act has become law and states are now permitted to extend health care coverage to children before birth we invite all persons of good will whether across the political aisle or within our party to work together to reduce the incidence of abortion to protect girls from exploitation and statutory rape through a parental notification requirement and to oppose sex selection abortions we all have a moral obligation to assist not to penalize women struggling with the challenges of an unplanned pregnancy we salute those who provide them alternatives including crisis pregnancy centers and we take pride in the tremendous increase in adoptions that has followed republican legislative initiatives
8616040 asserts the rights of families in all international programs and will not fund organizations involved in abortion we reject any treaty or agreement that would violate those values that includes the un convention on womens rights and the un convention on the rights of the child

8616095 has broadened the philosophical divide between food manufacturers which generally favor the expanded use of such technology and many food safety and organic food groups that oppose it

8616107 but wilson is no mere shock jock and while her revelations about pop culture occasionally restate the obvious they do so in terms so hilariously biting as to render them almost canonical
8616108 a lot of people say well what do you actors need why are you speaking up youre not people who need anything and its true were very blessed but almost all of us come from real middle class families and because we have the platform that we do it makes it a little bit easier for us to speak up speak out but everyone should really be doing it mostly im just here because im a bleeding heart liberal and a concerned citizen and i cant wait to hear the speeches every election is historic but this one is particularly so and so im so excited to be here
8616109 i dont feel very good about the last eight years and i feel like were in a place where we really need theres a lot of damage that we need to recover from and we need a very strong and inspirational leader to bring us out of this its pretty grim
8616110 i did support hillary rodham clinton in the new york primary because ive been an admirer of hillarys for a long time shes been an excellent senator and of course i was slightly biased by the fact that she was a woman i never thought that in my lifetime i would have the pleasure of voting for a woman for president so i did vote for her in the primary but i always admired barack obama and when it became time for hillary to step aside and for obama to become the nominee i was very pleased to be able to support him and i prayed that he would pick joe biden for his vice president i thought that was the best possible choice
8616111 one of the benefits and pleasures of being an actor is having the opportunity to travel around the united states to travel overseas i began traveling to europe and asia when i was about 20 and the respect that our country had the regard that our country had throughout the world was so tremendous the embrace that youd receive just for being an american was extraordinary and over the last eight years during my travels ive seen that love for our country become so compromised that i dont know how well ever regain our stature in the world
8616112 if you go overseas you see how much theres an excitement that a country that the rest of the world felt got so lost suddenly is on track enough to make a change this dramatic not only an african american but a man whose name is barack obama theres so many different elements of it that suddenly make i think the rest of the world feel like hey maybe theyre not as insane as we think they are and that to me is primarily what i keep seeing
8616113 the situation at our network is about to blow up
8616114 i am honored to be here tonight to support barack obama
8616115 like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8616116 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8616117 sixteen years ago democrats gave me the profound honor to lead our party to victory and to lead our nation to a new era of peace and broadly shared prosperity together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8616119 how desperate mccain is to tell the son of a single mother who chose community service over money and privilege that he doesnt put america first
8616120 candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8616121 i know barack obama i met him when he visited me and other wounded troops at walter reed he came without reporters he wasnt looking for credit he knew that wherever you stand on the war you must love the warrior and he does
8616122 the administration of george bush supported by john mccain every step of the way has let our warriors down
8616123 when our warriors come home they deserve the best va medical care but too often they get bureaucracy not benefits they find inadequate access inferior facilities and infuriating paperwork and now john mccain wants to ration care
8616124 barack obama gets it like many of us barack worked his way up his is a great american story
8616125 but i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8616126 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8616127 the situation at our network is about to blow up
8616128 the situation at our network is about to blow up
8616129 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8616130 i think im more in touch with the american people as far as my policies my proposals and my ideas
8616131 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8616132 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8616133 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8616134 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8616135 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8616136 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8616137 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need

8616208 we know that it will be difficult and that it is a big ask to undo a 3 0 defeat but why not try napoli seem to be a very strong and clever team but i thought 3 0 was a false result from the first leg
8616209 however we must be realistic because in albania we dont have great players who are ready for the big clubs as our athletes cant grow up playing at the most competitive level

8616212 the fall in the housing market has already resulted in the loss of some of suffolks respected estate agents they and suffolks home owners deserve support from the government not dithering and political posturing
8616213 suffolk needs urgent action to kick start the housing market but gordon brown continues to dither the speculation over stamp duty is further undermining the market and causing buyers to wait and see what happens
8616214 before hips were introduced the government ignored warnings from experts that this new red tape would harm the housing market and the economy these warnings have been proved correct
8616215 gordon brown may see the speculation over stamp duty as a distraction from the speculation over his leadership however if he genuinely wanted to help the housing market across the uk and here in suffolk he would suspend hips immediately
8616216 the fall in the housing market has already resulted in the loss of some of suffolks respected estate agents they and suffolks home owners deserve support from the government not dithering and political posturing
8616217 i am pleased that i have obtained this information from the highways agency on behalf of everyone that uses the a14 however their response lacks urgency it has been over a month since this problem occurred and we need action
8616218 it is clear from the letter that the highways agency has yet to close the carriageway and obtain the necessary cores to properly analyse the situation given the recurring problems in this area of the a14 i would have hoped that this would have been treated with the importance it deserves
8616219 the a14 is a key arterial road running through the heart of suffolk and this should be recognised when work is prioritised
8616220 i am delighted that the new carriageway is opening on schedule and on budget it will make an enormous difference to my constituents especially residents of stowmarket and the surrounding villages who have had to put up with disruption for so long
8616221 the quarterly updates i received enabled me to keep an eye on the highways agencys management of the project
8616222 i am looking forward to a smoother journey through my constituency
8616223 closing stowmarket jobcentre makes no sense at all when the demand for their services is likely to rise
8616224 telling job seekers that they must travel to bury st edmunds or ipswich to access the full range of jobcentre plus services demonstrates how out of touch the government is with rural areas if you havent got a job you cant afford to travel to and fro you need services to be provided locally
8616225 neither can it be assumed that everyone can access jobcentre services online the recent post office consultation showed very clearly that many people in stowmarket do not have internet access
8616226 i call on the management of jobcentre plus to think again it is crazy to close stowmarket jobcentre plus just when it may be needed most

8616265 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama

8616267 barack obama is ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8616268 i know you hear that phrase a lot in politics i mean it
8616269 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8616270 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8616271 and president clinton reminded us of what its like when you have a president who actually puts people first thank you
8616272 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8616273 i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8616274 you all sit down we have to get on with the show
8616275 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding instincts and insight america will have the national security leadership we need
8616276 the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam
8616277 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8616278 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8616279 lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks
8616280 what you really want is a missing cell type one that is not functioning properly to be derived from something else but you only want that cell type so i think this is a really important step forward in exercising what people really wanted and showing how well it can work by this gene over expression procedure
8616281 provides exciting new insights into yet another aspect of cell plasticity that was not appreciated previously and that offers great potential therapeutically direct reprogramming represents a more straight forward strategy to treat diseases involving loss of function of specific cell populations than approaches requiring an intermediate embryonic stem cell
8616282 more than a little surprised to find that we could use a combination of just three transcription factors to reprogram one cell type into another
8616283 combined a systematic approach to identifying the relevant transcription factors hard work and a bit of luck
8616284 by asking what genes you have to have turned on in the cell for it to become a beta cell
8616285 if you want to do reprogramming it doesnt take great insight to figure out that the key genes are transcription factors the proteins that bind dna and tell cells which genes to turn on and which to turn off
8616286 and the locks are transcription factors we asked which ones are present in the beta cell and that gave us 1 100 transcription factors to choose from eventually we learned that of the 1 100 only about 200 are actually expressed in cells that are involved in forming the pancreas
8616287 we decided that of the 200 we only cared about the ones that are expressed in the key part of the pancreas where the beta cells are and that got us down to about 28 then we did some lineage studies
8616288 and we got it down to nine joe said my best guess is its these nine and he were right it was a messy experiment mixing all nine and injecting them into the pancreas then we found out that it got better and better as we removed one gene at a time from the nine and eventually we found that it actually works best with three transcription factors that six of them arent that important and thats the fun of science
8616289 if it hadnt worked with those nine wed probably have dropped the experiment and gone onto something else there would have been just too many possible combinations of transcription factors to wade through
8616290 were intrigued by the possibility that this approach which has worked for pancreatic insulin producing cells could be more widely applied to many kind of cells especially those that are lost in disease or following injury
8616291 and at the same time we are exploring the possibility of using this general approach in a clinical context to make new beta cells for patients

8616329 the most significant component of nfs v4 1 is the inclusion of pnfs which represents the first major performance upgrade to nfs in over a decade
8616330 panasas has been a leader in the development of the pnfs standard from the very beginning
8616331 the panasas directflow protocol used in our activestor parallel storage clusters currently provides essentially all of the functionality expected to be available in the nfsv4 1 later this year
8616332 users and application developers can take immediate advantage of the high performance and superior ease of use of the only production proven parallel storage system today the activestor parallel storage clusters from panasas
8616333 we are very excited that the panasas architecture is being adopted as standard by the storage industry as it validates the importance of parallel storage and our vision for the future of file storage
8616334 nfs v4 1 will finally give users a reason to aggressively migrate to the latest version of nfs primarily because of the dramatic performance benefits of pnfs

8616387 we might play two tight ends because were not ready to step out and say its malcolm brandon collins or james kirkendoll its because of inconsistency they play great one day and the next day they dont weve had one of our best camps but in some positions weve had too much inconsistency and thats why we dont have a starter

8616421 the bright yellow larvae are oval shaped with six rows of branched spines the larvae feed for two to five weeks larvae and adults feed on all types of beans and are an occasional pest of soybeans they generally feed on the underside of leaves removing all of the leaf tissue except the clear layer on the upper side of the leaf called the epidermis
8616422 once we sold it to capital radio in 1998 it never really had a clear focus it was pulled left right and centre with different management imposing different visions trying to make it what they wanted it to be rather than what it should have been
8616423 it undermined what we set out to do like any brand if you dont have a clear vision then it is just going to dilute and whither away
8616424 last year it had a lower market share than when we first launched it ten years on it should have had a much more significant presence

8616447 is there not a prophet of the lord here whom we can inquire of
8616448 there is still one man through whom we can inquire of the lord but i hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me but always bad he is micaiah son of imlah
8616449 for the lord will give it into the kings hand
8616450 look as one man the other prophets are predicting success for the king let your word agree with theirs and speak favorably

8616469 in souls that are striving to rise in the service of god our lord it is characteristic of the good spirit to give courage and strength consolations tears inspirations and peace
8616470 it is characteristic of the evil spirit to harass with anxiety to afflict with sadness to raise obstacles backed by false reasonings that disturb the soul thus he seeks to prevent the soul from advancing
8616471 a clue that they are not from the good spirit god
8616472 despondency is a form of desolation and just as the holy spirit normally guides a person in consolation the evil spirit normally guides during desolation
8616473 though in desolation we must never change our former resolutions it will be very advantageous to intensify our activity against the desolation
8616474 this idea of acting against agere contra is very important in discernment
8616475 the false reasonings begin to melt away and what previously seemed heavy and burdensome becomes light and a joy
8616476 will god begin to make the next step clear and the obstacles will be seen for what they are false reasonings
8616477 it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy
8616478 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8616479 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8616480 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8616481 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8616482 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8616483 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8616484 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8616485 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8616486 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8616487 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

8616503 there is pressure on my team to do well in the ipl next year because last year we did not get the results we wanted that was in part was down to players coming and going for international duty

8616516 my session addresses how weve leveraged employee performance management as a critical part of our business alignment model linking individual objectives to organizational goals for improved corporate performance

8616527 one of our central tasks is the creation of the post oil megacity
8616528 we make this mistake when we insist that a word must have the same meaning every time it occurs for example if we are confident that a word carries a certain meaning in seven of its eight occurrences in scripture we might be tempted to conclude that it must have the same meaning in its eighth occurrence yet as darrel bock maintains word meanings are determined by context not word counts
8616529 we can now be as certain as historical research will presently allow that josephus did refer to jesus

8616534 the cooperation between the relevant oil companies from china and iraq is mutually beneficial
8616535 it will be conducive to the economic development of iraq and will meet chinas demands in the oil field as well and is also conducted according to market rules and will not harm any interests of any third parties
8616536 with oil prices surging the global contest for oil resources is becoming ever fiercer many governments have realised this and have become unwilling to sell their oil resources cheaply to the multinationals

8616553 if gareth stays with us for the foreseeable future i will be really delighted it will be a really big bonus for us if gareth is here this time next week i will be relieved
8616554 i would have said only a few weeks ago that i was resigned to the fact gareth would no longer be here around about the time we played reading in pre season and when he didnt come with us to malaga because i assumed everything would be done that week
8616555 but as for the future now lets go one step at a time that is what i would be looking at
8616556 i wouldnt want to be rushing anyone into making decisions or asking anyone to do something that no one is really comfortable with
8616557 gareth will have better days for us than at stoke with a bit of luck but saturday might just have been a culmination of four games in quick succession the lack of any steady pre season build up and all of those things
8616558 i couldnt have faulted him in any of the matches he had played for us before that one and it was just maybe everything getting to him at the one time including maybe that sharpness and fitness that he is still striving for
8616559 is gareth in the right frame of mind i think he answered that with his performances in the games he has played for us
8616560 i will tell you that we are very keen to try to strengthen our side between now and transfer deadline day
8616561 i am sure i could get one or two in anyway but it is just adding the sort of quality that i would want and that is exactly what i will be trying to do
8616562 am i a fan of milner he was nearly here two years ago he nearly signed two years ago but it didnt materialise but i never think anything is done and dusted until anything happens
8616563 so many things have happened to me as a player and as a manager that i would never take anything for granted it was disappointing at the time but it was two years ago
8616564 priscillas background and success in ad sales and marketing in both traditional and online media is a perfect fit for this senior sales management position on the east coast

8616566 if gareth stays with us for the foreseeable future i will be really delighted
8616567 it will be a really big bonus for us if gareth is here this time next week i will be relieved
8616568 i would have said only a few weeks ago that i was resigned to the fact gareth would no longer be here he didnt come with us to the preseason tour of malaga because i assumed everything would be done that week
8616569 we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steven would play in this match with the pain

8616616 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8616617 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8616618 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

8616621 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8616622 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

8616651 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8616652 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8616653 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8616654 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8616655 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8616692 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8616693 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8616694 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8616695 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8616696 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8616697 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8616698 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8616699 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8616700 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8616701 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8616702 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8616703 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

8616707 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8616708 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8616709 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8616710 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

8616718 ye have taken away my gods which i have made and what have i more
8616719 shall there be evil in the city and the lord hath not done it
8616720 hear this o ye that swallow up the poor and the needy even to make the poor of the land fail saying when will the new moon be gone that we may sell corn and the sabbath that we may set forth wheat making the ephah small and the shekel great and falsifying the balances by deceit that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes yea and sell the refuse of the wheat
8616721 the lord hath sworn by the excellency of jacob surely i will never forget their works shall not the land tremble for this and every one that dwelleth therein i will darken the earth in a clear day and i will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation and i will bring up sackcloth upon all loins and baldness upon every head and i will make it as the mourning of an only son and the end thereof as a bitter day
8616722 behold this was the iniquity of thy sister sodom pride fulness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters
8616723 is it a time for you 0 ye to dwell in your ceiled houses and this house lie waste now therefore thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways ye have sown much and bring in little ye eat but ye have not enough ye drink but ye are not filled with drink ye clothe you but there is none warm and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes
8616724 ye looked for much and lo it came to little and when ye brought it home i did blow upon it saith the lord of hosts
8616725 because of mine house that is waste and ye did run every man to his own house therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew and the earth is stayed from her fruit and i called for drought upon the land and upon the mountains and upon the corn and upon the wine and upon the oil and upon that which the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon cattle and upon all the labour of the hands
8616726 i know as john mccain knows the people of pennsylvania are hurting right now
8616727 they are concerned about their jobs they are concerned about the ability to stay in their homes they are concerned about the rising prices of food and fuel and they are concerned about our continued ability to compete in this 21st century economy and thats why i think john mccain will do very well in pennsylvania
8616728 he has put forward a comprehensive plan to get the economy moving again focusing first and foremost on small business
8616729 because small business creates two thirds of the jobs in this country we need to make sure that small businesses can continue to form and grow
8616730 we are going to fight hard in pennsylvania we intend to win pennsylvania

8616736 reducing health inequities is an ethical imperative social injustice is killing people on a grand scale
8616737 there is no good biological reason why this should be the case
8616738 these health inequalities are preventable they arise from the circumstances in which people are born grow live work and age the social determinants of health
8616739 the commission considers health care a common good not a market commodity
8616740 the commission advocates financing the health care system through general taxation and or mandatory universal insurance the evidence is compellingly in favour of a publicly funded health care system
8616741 we are distressed by the reports we see of healthcare simply being unavailable to people because of inability to pay and we see that throughout lower and middle income countries
8616742 not for me to tell one of the richest countries on earth how it should organise its health care system
8616743 we are not suggesting that it organizations stay away from blades blades do address many problems in the data center

8616745 there are positively thrilling glimpses of campbells immense talent for interpreting country pop as he charms his way through the foo fighters times like these
8616746 these arent cheesy lounge renditions or tongue in cheek overstatements reminiscent of tom jones covers of dance hits much like johnny cashs late in life work with producer rick rubin these are serious recordings where campbell locates the emotional thread in meaningful lyrics from those with different backgrounds than his the best cuts his takes on jackson brownes these days u2s all i want is you and john lennons grow old with me own a timeless beauty that bridges generations and cultures
8616747 producer julian raymond who says hes been a campbell fan since age 9 does a fine job bringing the songs to the artists identifiable style rather than painting him into a difficult corner meet glen campbell indeed
8616748 reverence for campbells greatest work is what grounds meet glen campbell as it shows a deep understanding of what made those recordings work as pop records as well as an understanding of what a terrific interpretive singer campbell is at his peak for too long glen campbell has been wandering away from these strengths singing anonymous songs in sterile settings but here he has the right production and an exceptional set of songs all adding up an album that is alluringly out of time caught somewhere between the 60s and the 90s illustrating how enduring campbells sound really is

8616813 what wall street appears to be missing is that since adi has sold off some of its lower profit business units its seasonal sales patterns have changed adi is now again driven by industrial market sectors much more than it was even just last year
8616814 therefore its conservative guidance of flat to up 3 sequentially shouldnt have been a big surprise nor a cause for concern as a matter of fact with its minimal exposure to pc and consumer markets i think flat to up 3 is pretty good
8616815 what wall street would be better to focus on are the operational improvements adi has made in its july quarter adi improved its pro forma operating margin to 26 5 from 26 2 last quarter and again reduced its inventory which sits now at the lowest level weve seen since 2004
8616816 if we look back at last year and include the results from divested businesses its operating margin was only 22 8
8616817 in addition to this adi has nearly replaced all of the low margin revenues from divested businesses with higher margin revenues including divested businesses in the july 2007 quarter adi reported revenues of 680 3m
8616818 excluding those businesses in the july 2008 quarter adi reported sales of 659m a very modest 3 decline however when we look at pro forma gross profit dollars adi generated 403 7m in the july quarter this year versus 391 1m last year if this is bad i want more bad
8616819 in my prior review of the stock i wrote that it was time to hold off on accumulating shares of adi due to the price appreciation we had seen from buy recommendations made earlier in 2008
8616820 acquisitions and cost cuts have accounted for most of ibms growth in recent years in the 10 years ended 2006 sales increased at an annualized rate of less than 2 and the company lost both market share and in uence
8616821 however sales growth has accelerated in each of the last three quarters and per share pro ts have risen at least 23 in each period
8616822 a broad business mix has helped the company keep growing during the economic slowdown ibm may still be best known for its hardware but the companys strength over the last year has stemmed from the services and software businesses which tend to be less economically sensitive than hardware
8616823 hardware accounted for about 18 of sales in the six months ended june while services represented 58 and software generated 20 financing operations brought in most of the last 4
8616824 while the current economic climate has pinched the consumer companies are still investing heavily in new technology
8616825 in the june quarter ibm signed 14 7 billion in service contracts up 12 increasing the services backlog to 117 billion nearly twice annual services revenue
8616826 software revenue jumped 15 in the six months ended june services and software growth more than offset a 2 decline in revenue from the systems and technology unit which produces servers and other hardware
8616827 ibm is also benefiting from its strong presence overseas particularly in emerging markets foreign sales accounted for 63 of 2007 revenue a percentage likely to increase in coming years
8616828 emerging markets such as brazil russia india and china which combined to post a 31 sales gain in the june quarter represent a strong growth opportunity for ibm the company is investing heavily in the four huge countries as well as in eastern europe and the middle east
8616829 management expressed concern about economic weakness in some of the worlds largest developed markets including the u s but that worry has been factored into growth expectations

8616960 because the database offers highly pedigreed information users can count on what they find there its peer reviewed and they can have a high degree of certainty of it being reliable
8616961 bio response data for that material would be sent to our mpmd product developer at materials park
8616962 the information provided would be edited and peer reviewed prior to its release by our editors and the contributors name would be added to an authors table in the database
8616963 this kind of visibility is a tremendous asset in becoming better known in the medical devices community
8616964 being published in the database will be a worthy addition for established professionals and will also be valuable for younger professionals who are looking to build their list of authored papers

8617003 who are open to doing something on the production side

8617015 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

8617198 it was not divided in any way by anybody either by which quarterback to go after or whether to do it
8617199 its a quarterback league and we need to get the best quarterback
8617200 i like his anticipation i just like his clock he plays with a great clock in his head he understands the game he understands the running game blocking schemes pass protections but hes also a good player and statistically speaking his rating if that means anything is as good as a lot of guys who have ever played
8617201 theres a lot of pressure on him to come in here and start in a league with some very good defensive ends and linebackers who are coming his way
8617202 if he was going in the wrong spot and not reading the coverages it would be one thing
8617203 what id really like to see is more consistency with the guys surrounding him and id like to see somebody step up and make a play for us
8617204 id like to see guys get in the right spots so vince knows where theyre going to be if were not in the right spots were not doing the right things were not separating its awful hard to look good throwing
8617205 it learning is gradual im picking up things as i go this whole year im looking at as a challenge to myself to improve on a lot of things and make plays but to me it ultimately comes to having fun and being a football player im excited about where i am and where im going
8617206 its late in the preseason and we have to be careful with what we do from here on in we have to get our guys ready for the opening game sept 7 against seattle
8617207 i need to be around the guys be in the huddle they need to see me practicing and thats what im trying to accomplish right now regardless of injuries as a quarterback for this team you need to be able to practice and be in rhythm with your receivers and linemen tight ends and running backs the more practice i can get before the seahawks game the better
8617208 it really isnt so much about alex smith than j t s performance has been so unusual i think that alex is fine he hasnt done anything to discredit him as a starter or say that he cant play or that were dissatisfied with thats not the issue at all we had the opportunity to give the guys a day off from their arms j t stepped in and did some remarkable things when he got looked at and the more we gave him the better he did and it just took off from there so to say that alex hasnt done well would not be a correct statement
8617209 hopefully well get enough snaps in there with our first offensive line that we will be able to play both those guys

8617271 its because of the respect we have for them and the enormity of the challenge we have in front of us trying to win back to back south african test matches and in johannesburg for the first time in so long that we feel we need to bring in some fresh legs
8617272 last weekend in durban took a lot out of our guys as it did some of theirs we will need the impetus that the fresh legs weve included today will bring
8617273 they south africa have got one more shot at it in this years tri nations
8617274 if they can take it they can park the rest of the tournament and move forward a lot more positively towards their end of season tour preparations ask yourself how youd feel in their position theres no doubt theyll be up for it
8617275 saturday still has huge significance both in terms of momentum in the tri nations but also as far as the development of our group as a whole is concerned
8617276 by winning in durban last weekend we have presented ourselves with an opportunity to win back to back test matches in south africa which is not only rare in an australian context but is also historically significant across the game in general
8617277 we owe it to ourselves and to everyone who is associated with australian rugby to make the most of that opportunity

8617293 im not at all apologetic that we asked for federal support for huge health care needs of this growing community
8617294 he was a crucial supporter of the law in that he paved the way for other democrats to support it
8617295 senator biden provided a lot of political cover for the credit card industry because they wanted to show that the proposal had bipartisan support he aggressively undermined the opposition to the bill
8617296 hunter consulted for five years as an expert on these very same issues at a time of enormous expansion in online banking

8617618 i think what it does mean is that some of the highly confident assertions about where the economy was going in february march and april proved completely wrong i think its clear that the second quarter not only wasnt a recession quarter it was actually a very robust quarter
8617619 the numbers are a bit better than expected on the headlines claims were in line but gdp number is revised higher than expected i think it shows the u s economy in general is performing at a better level than what people probably expected two or three months ago and the u s has the potential to lead global growth in the second half of the year
8617620 gdp came in stronger than what the market was looking for this is positive for the equity markets and anything positive for equity is generally negative for bonds
8617621 jobless claims fell and the continuing claims rose so those two things offset each other its a mixed result the outlook for the economy is still bleak as consumer confidence remains low and the housing market is still grinding lower
8617622 the outlook for third quarter gdp is less than 1 percent so i still have a negative outlook
8617623 the market is gaining increasing confidence the strain in the financial markets and high oil prices will not tip the economy into a recession

8617636 the avma believes proposition 2 standards for confining farm animals is admirable in its goal to improve the welfare of production farm animals however it ignores critical aspects of animal welfare that ultimately would threaten the well being of the very animals it strives to protect
8617637 proposition 2 may have negative impacts on animals consumers and the industry if its passed
8617638 we fully agree that more attention needs to be paid to the behavioral and social needs of food animals and proposition 2 is laudable in that it attempts to address these needs but the standards in this ballot initiative fall short in improving animal welfare because they fail to adequately consider other factors animal welfare is a complex issue and demands that decisions be based on science tempered with compassion and take into account all aspects of welfare changing housing standards without consideration of how this may affect other aspects of animal welfare such as protection from disease and injury will not be in the animals or societys best interest

8617667 john thinks that during the bush years we made great economic progress i think its been abysmal
8617668 at the start of this campaign we had a very simple idea change in america doesnt start from top down it starts from bottom up and that change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things

8617683 rund 240 000 sterreichische haushalte nutzen die sonne bereits f r warmwasser und raumheizung und sparen sich dadurch energiekosten in h he von rund 110 mio euro pro jahr
8617684 die individuellen ersparnisse richten sich nach der energieform die durch die solarw rme ersetzt wird
8617685 mit einer solchen kollektorfl che kann man warmwasser von ostern bis oktober mit hilfe der sonnenenergie gewinnen
8617686 aus einer bundesweiten erhebung der antragszahlen geht hervor dass im zweiten quartal die f rderantr ge in sterreich um mehr als ein viertel gestiegen sind
8617687 die gr nde f r den einbruch im vorjahr liegen wahrscheinlich in einer generellen verunsicherung denn auch die sanierungsaktivit ten waren r ckl ufig
8617688 mit 20 164 antr gen im juni wurden so viele f rderantr ge f r solarw rmeanlagen gestellt wie nie zuvor
8617689 im grunde genommen kann man sagen dass kein kollektor nach sterreich importiert wird
8617690 f r den export bedeutet das allerdings ein deutliches wachstum da viele solarw rmeanlagen aus sterreichischer produktion nach deutschland gehen
8617691 obwohl die schutzgebiete eigentlich nicht als mittel gegen die bleiche eingerichtet wurden gab es gro e erwartungen dass ein gesunder fischbestand dem riff das berleben sichern k nnte
8617692 einige riffgebiete wie etwa die des einsamen chagos archipels den s dlichen ausl ufern der malediven hatten sich rascher erholt als andere regionen schreiben die experten
8617693 die meeresstr mungen haben die riffe offensichtlich auch von abgesetzten sedimentresten befreit diese wirken hemmend auf die wiederbesiedlung von korallen
8617694 f r die erholung der fischbest nde sind diese zonen sehr wichtig
8617695 dringend erforderlich sind in diesem zusammenhang auch reduktionen hinsichtlich der umweltbelastung und dem eintrag an sedimenten
8617696 die politik hat bislang in weiten teilen versagt die regierungen gleichen rzten die dem todkranken patienten ostsee trotz eindeutiger diagnose die rettende medizin verweigern
8617697 das ergebnis ist sehr ern chternd weil kein land die ostsee umfassend sch tzt wir brauchen bundesliga format um dieses einzigartige meer zu retten dass deutschland jetzt tabellenf hrer auf kreisliganiveau ist kann kein ruhekissen sein
8617698 durch das intensive d ngen in den sp tfr hlingsmonaten gelangen allj hrlich gro e mengen von d ngemittel in die meere
8617699 seit geraumer zeit gibt es bereits eine ballastwasser konvention doch ist diese in den meisten anrainerstaaten noch immer nicht ratifiziert unter anderem auch nicht von deutschland
8617700 nur im bottischen meerbusen zwischen schweden und finnland ist die belastung mittlerweile so hoch dass dort gefangener fisch nicht mehr in die eu importiert werden darf
8617701 in der investmentsparte der banken ist das misstrauen untereinander stark gestiegen
8617702 wenn bei pr natalen untersuchungen eine bestimmte chromosomale auff lligkeit ein sogenanntes kleines markerchromosom bei einem ungeborenen festgestellt wird dann entscheiden sich fast 60 prozent der eltern das kind abtreiben zu lassen

8617708 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 20 000 for each eye treated
8617709 but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings
8617710 studies have also demonstrated that patients with visual impairment tend to have longer hospitalisations make greater use of health and community care services and are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes
8617711 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 16 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period our guidance means that patients who are suitable for this treatment will have the same access to it irrespective of where they live
8617712 nices guidance will finally bring an end to a cruel postcode lottery
8617713 those responsible for nice should be aware that during the cumbersome two year review process 152 pcts have individually had the power to decide whether to let patients go blind or to save their sight
8617714 many hundreds of vulnerable patients have been subjected to an appalling emotional rollercoaster ride for the past two years during which many of them have lost their remaining sight
8617715 an innovative approach which shows how pharmaceutical companies can work together with nice and the department of health to ensure patients do get access to treatments on the nhs
8617716 wet amd is a debilitating eye condition that can result in a rapid loss of sight if left untreated
8617717 rapid implementation of the guidance is now needed to ensure that patients receive the treatment they need as soon as possible
8617718 vanessa should have been walking out of that hospital totally healthy
8617719 change the system that killed my daughter to make it a safe system thats the apology i want from reba meagher
8617720 im shocked with the extent of these deaths given the government has denied them is not reporting them is failing to come clean with the extent of problems in our hospitals
8617721 doctors are coming with ideas on how we can reform im pleased to back them
8617722 our doctor shortage is not as severe as some of the mainland states
8617723 ya pokoknya dia baik sangat solehah kalo untuk lebih detilnya saya saat ini tak bisa ngasih informasi
8617724 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8617725 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8617726 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8617727 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8617728 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8617729 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8617730 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8617731 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8617732 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8617733 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8617734 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8617735 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8617736 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8617737 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8617738 no one works for someone we all just work together
8617739 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8617740 i ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years
8617741 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8617742 joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding instincts and insight america will have the national security leadership
8617743 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8617744 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8617745 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8617746 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8617747 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8617748 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8617749 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8617750 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8617751 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8617752 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8617753 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8617754 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8617755 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8617756 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8617757 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8617758 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8617759 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8617760 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8617761 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8617762 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8617763 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8617764 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8617765 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8617766 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8617767 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8617768 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8617769 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8617770 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8617771 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8617772 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8617773 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8617774 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8617775 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8617776 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8617777 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8617778 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8617779 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8617780 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8617781 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8617782 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8617783 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8617784 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8617785 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8617786 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8617787 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8617788 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8617789 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8617790 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8617791 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8617792 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8617793 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8617794 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8617795 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8617796 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8617797 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8617798 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8617799 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8617800 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8617801 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8617802 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8617803 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8617804 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8617805 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8617806 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8617807 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8617808 we always had the problem of where to dump the biological waste of buffalo slaughter
8617809 and we were treated like enemy of everyone but we did not have any alternative to dumping the waste in the river
8617810 for now we neither have tensions over dumping nor do the residents have any complaints about getting affected by the hazardous waste
8617811 now the people no longer have to muzzle their noses with masks
8617812 when the plant becomes fully operational next month it will generate 12 000 liter gas and 3 000 liter liquid compost fertilizer
8617813 the project was conceptualized years ago as i visited various bio gas plants and plant producer companies which were in business simply by the feeding of biological waste of animals
8617814 after that we started to work for the project at the community level
8617815 we always had a problem about the dumping of such waste as it had to be taken care of separately
8617816 listen o isles unto me and hearken ye people from afar
8617817 thou art my servant o israel in whom i will be glorified
8617818 according to the act kmc can regulate parking only in select areas but we have no policy to regulate roadside parking
8617819 we took the initiative on our own though we dont have any policy in this regard
8617820 but we share only rs 100 to rs 200 each because we have to give the rest of the money to bhotahiti bazaar committee
8617821 we are losing a huge amounts of money because of failure to bring all these areas under our control
8617822 we were overwhelmed by other priorities and couldnt take action on time
8617823 its very difficult for us to manage smooth traffic system due to unmanaged parking places
8617824 you had a distinguished career in the police force and unhappily now find yourself at court
8617825 but a mental disorder is not an excuse to get involved in crime
8617826 when he was first diagnosed he did not accept it he thought it was weak and unmanly to be mentally ill and to have to take tablets and he ignored it
8617827 he got into a situation where his illness was not being controlled and his lifestyle was chaotic he would drink alcohol and this would affect his medication
8617828 he realises now there is nothing unmanly with taking medication and that unless he manages his illness he will get into further trouble
8617829 a long discussion followed in reference to the use of the name voltaire
8617830 when it was discovered to be the name of a great french atheist and disbeliever in revealed theology
8617831 the word admire was chosen and has since been the name of the village and post office
8617832 articles were piled up on smalls meadows as high as a two story house you could find anything there from a clock to a steam boiler and engine
8617833 the latter the grills was created by paul manship who is best known for his work on prometheus at rockefeller center in new york city
8617834 sure i hate the guy but this will help him get more votes
8617835 i want this guy to win i think he is the right guy and i will vote for him but this thing will cost him votes
8617836 and now mccain is promising 200 million in new taxes for big oil

8617853 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8617854 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8617855 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8617856 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8617857 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8617858 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8617859 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8617860 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8617861 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8617862 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8617863 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8617864 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8617865 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8617866 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8617867 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8617868 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community

8617915 i pulled her over because she was driving in the hov lane as a single passenger
8617916 when she saw me coming she moved into the right lane
8617917 she said thats why i dont respect you because you never use discretion
8617918 i entered i66 at rosslyn when the hov time was 4pm and when i came up to the signs i specifically looked for a possible time change and when i saw that it was three oclock i started to move over i used my signal so he should have seen it did you see that i was using my signal to get over im not sure why he is allowed to tell you my thoughts in court because i in fact did not see any police officers and was moving over on my own accord i retraced the route and the signs occur only two tenths of a mile before they were stopping traffic under the overpass i was unable to move over because i was blocked in by the stopped traffic in the second lane i decided not to come to a complete stop in the fast lane and instead slow down until traffic in the next lane started moving again
8617919 the officer did not pull me over in the hov lane because he stopped two lanes of traffic on a five lane highway and nearly gave me a heart attack when i saw him pointing at me from the second lane
8617920 well if youre saying probably then that confirms that my statement is more accurate than yours because you stated previously that it was one quarter of a mile and now youre using the word probably
8617921 you have told us that you thought it was 4clock
8617922 no i didnt thats not at all what i said i exactly said that i entered the hov lane when the time was 4pm and i said specifically that i looked at the sign to see that the time had changed to 3 and so i started to move over at no point did i tell you that i thought the current hov lane was 4 oclock
8617923 shhh shes gonna put you in jail seriously shes gonna put you in jail
8617924 do not mock me did you seriously just mock me
8617925 in a court of law you have mocked me and now youre calling me an idiot in a courtroom hearing for a traffic violation because you dont like not my tone but my style of speaking
8617926 i stopped traffic when i saw her in the hov lane
8617927 this is a court of law we have a legislature and this is not what you see on tv this is not judge judys courtroom and we behave like adults in an adult voice we dont wine and we dont act like children and i need to take a seat and think about

8617938 lloyd following on from your call earlier on to the police please can you contact us if you are able to establish what has been stolen and where from
8617939 at this time were struggling to get the police to attend general area due to other calls for service many thanks
8617940 we were disgusted to text the person who calls and ask them to investigate what had been stolen broken into and who did it is incredible
8617941 it just gives burglars the idea that they can get away with it because the police arent going to send anyone out what message does that send to my neighbours is it just pointless to call police if you see someone breaking into a house
8617942 we went back to bed and were woken at 6am by a text message saying they couldnt get any officers out
8617943 i would have thought they should have been able to catch a man in a white t shirt as there couldnt have been many running around at five in the morning it is complete madness the police are essentially asking us to do their job for them it makes you wonder what we pay our taxes for
8617944 it is shocking to think things have got so bad that police are texting people to ask them to be volunteer sleuths
8617945 due to the number of emergency calls we were unable to send an officer straight to the scene
8617946 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden onto hard pressed british families and businesses
8617947 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8617948 the government is talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut

8617988 i just got off the phone with terri martain from the dep here in boston
8617989 i was very surprised to learn that she spoke with you and bob smith three years ago about the need for elected water commissioners for any municipal water system she told you in no uncertain terms that they are required by law
8617990 also ive learned that without elected water commissioners you are not eligible for state grants

8617992 let me know what ruth has to say i cant wait to read her argument for why hyannis is so special that they dont have to observe state law david still editor of the barnstable patriot also got involved yesterday i received the following email from him
8617993 interesting on the water commissioners it does appear that barnstable is the only municipality without an elected board lowell springfield brockton fall river new bedford etc all have them
8617994 the argument here was always a home rule thing as an entity wholly within the town borders the town is free to determine the best approach as long as the required functions were handled thats the basic argument that i recall

8618056 jane doesnt ring true shes supposed to be a teenage rebel but in this chapter shes shopping at nordstrom while holding a starbucks latte which makes her seem more like a yuppie
8618057 jane doesnt ring true maybe instead of shopping at nordstrom while holding a starbucks latte you could have her crash her moms car through the window of nordstroms while drinking windex then id get a sense of how angry and out of control she is and it will be more believable when she drowns jimmys dog in the kiddie pool

8618059 of the 65 cases that were prosecuted 27 ended in a guilty plea or verdict giving scotland a 2 9 per cent conviction rate one of the lowest in europe
8618060 sandy brindley rape crisis scotland co ordinator said an independent inquiry was needed to ensure every aspect of the system from the police to the courts was no longer failing victims
8618061 a prosecution figure of 7 per cent for rape is extremely low what this means is the vast majority of rape cases never make it as far as court no one can suggest with any credibility that the vast majority of women reporting rape are lying
8618062 rape is a crime which can take a lot of courage to report and it can come as a shock for women to hear that their case is not being prosecuted

8618100 you just lost it you resented the child your dislike of the child came to the surface
8618101 you forcibly banged this childs head against a hard surface as a result of that you caused a fracture to the skull which resulted in death probably instantly
8618102 then you covered it up there was something almost cynical about the way you tried to cover it up
8618103 you told all sorts of lies some of them absurd lies
8618104 youre both the victims of a cycle of depravation but theres nothing in your background which justifies the way you treated this child

8618107 at that conference which took place just six days before rubys murder the decision was taken to place her on the child protection register under the categories of physical abuse and neglect

8618111 we heard most of this evidence for the first time in court and the court also heard that no residents at the hostel where ruby and laura were living ever complained to either us or the police about his treatment of ruby

8618115 the argument has been won that we need stronger local democratic leadership for policing the flanagan review of policing identified police accountability as a key decision for ministers and we are confident that responsibility will not be sidestepped
8618116 but not all forms of local democracy are equally effective he added to ensure that the proposals in the green paper help rather than hinder the cause of local democracy and improved local services we have set our four tests for any new proposals local policing should be more democratic but it should also be efficient joined up and closer to communities

8618124 com isso o c digo da vida se transforma em uma mensagem eterna traduzida ela mostra que as letras do antigo nome de deus est o codificadas como informa o gen tica em cada c lula da vida
8618125 o c digo de deus o segredo do nosso passado a promessa do nosso futuro
8618126 com base em seus valores equivalentes o hidrog nio se transforma na letra hebraica yod y o nitrog nio na letra hey h o oxig nio na letra vav v e o carbono na letra gimel g essas substitui es revelam que a antiga forma do nome de deus yh existe como qu mica do nosso c digo gen tico por meio dessa ponte entre o nome de deus e os elementos da ci ncia moderna poss vel desvendar o mist rio e descobrir um significado ainda maior no antigo c digo que vive em cada c lula do nosso corpo

8618129 mesmo levando em conta essas diferen as o c digo num rico oculto dos alfabetos hebraico e rabe revela precisamente o mesmo valor e produz precisamente o mesmo segredo do nome de deus no nosso corpo com isso o c digo leva a mesma mensagem de esperan a para as tr s religi es que congregam mais da metade da popula o do mundo o juda smo o islamismo e o cristianismo
8618130 seja qual for a fonte do nosso c digo gen tico o alto grau de ordem contido na mensagem diz que existe alguma coisa
8618131 somos o produto de elementos e mol culas que se combinaram ao acaso para produzir o milagre da vida ou somos o resultado de um ato intencional de cria o embora n o se elucide a origem do c digo em nossas c lulas o simples fato de sua exist ncia e a pouca probabilidade de essa mensagem ter se formado ao acaso sugerem que h uma intelig ncia e uma inten o subjacente nossa origem
8618132 h um nome que sobrevive como o nome pessoal de deus yhvh o eterno
8618133 quando substitu mos os elementos modernos pelas quatro letras do antigo nome de deus temos um resultado inesperado primeira vista trocando o h final de yhvh pelo seu equivalente qu mico o nitrog nio o oxig nio e nitrog nio hnon todos eles s o gazes sem cor sem cheiro e invis veis substituir 100 do nome pessoal de deus pelos elementos deste mundo cria uma subst ncia que uma forma de cria o intang vel mas real

8618156 the increased initial download size and hence slower speed the failure to show for increasingly popular webmail clients and the hassle of attachments still seem to indicate that embedded images are not the way to go in most cases
8618157 the topic of what is and isnt allowed under can spam almost always comes up during any discussion about using transactional e mail for marketing purposes while its always a good idea to verify that youre in compliance with can spam laws the good news is that when done properly this potentially lucrative and brand building practice is allowed the key comes down to knowing the law and acting accordingly

8618214 we wanted something completely different for the airport in a style which had not been used before
8618215 when we were looking at the concept we went down to flowcretes headquarters with milligans the manchester airport design team to mix our own colours
8618216 it was a completely bespoke product and we would have struggled to get that level of choice and flexibility together with speed of installation from any other type of flooring
8618217 we are pleased with the end result and fits perfectly with manchester airports vision of a clean simple and inviting environment for terminal 1
8618218 this installation shows just how creative resin flooring can be the new floor looks superb and can withstand all the rigours of a busy airport environment

8618244 i didnt have a clue you could go into 15 000 debt in one night
8618245 when i saw that bill i was just kind of numb
8618246 two thirds of the people who go into medical debt have insurance
8618247 when medical debt hits it hits very quickly its a jolt and its generally not very predictable
8618248 the most dangerous thing people do when they get into debt is ignore the statements and notices

8618250 i had a client once who was charged for a surgery she never had
8618251 another one was charged more than 5 000 for disposable gloves
8618252 people think they have to pay the amount on the bill but doctors and hospitals are very willing to negotiate
8618253 she could afford to pay 4 000 so i told her show them a certified check for 4 000 she did and told them this is all i have in the world and they took it

8618447 mcgraw hill mhp looks like a buy on current pullback to support came to my attention recently through my technical screens of potential bullish breakout stocks i always examine the fundamentals of a stock im considering short term trading to look for possible pitfalls and event risk mhps recent earnings report was mixed but did beat estimates certainly their standard amp poors division is in the spotlight hotseat currently with the credit crisis the company pays about a 2 0 dividend currently they have paid a dividend each year since 1937 and are apparently one of fewer than 30 companies in the s amp p 500 index that has increased its dividend annually for the last 35 years i like the healthy numbers i see for profit and operating margins as well as good roa amp roe numbers according to the data on yahoo finance while the company is commonly known for being a large publishing house especially in education i was interested to see that they also own several very nice brands companies such as standard amp poors businessweek magazine jd power amp associates platts aviation week and also 4 abc tv affiliates and 4 azteca tv affiliates i always feel that any company with such powerful brands is a prospect to unlock brand values in some way and or a possible takeover candidate with a 14 billion market cap and about 1 7 billion in debt again according to yahoo finance a takeover or some other way to unlock brand value could certainly be a possibility in my view do i have any rumors or information that any kind of deal like that is upcoming no but it is always a small possibility in a situation like this and is something nice to have in your favor when taking a long position i like to have the fundamentals daily amp weekly charts all working in my favor when i make trade recommendations to my clients bottom line in this case all 3 are working together to create my overall view that the current pullback on mhp to the 41 42ish area represents a good low risk entry point my first near term target is a re test of the 45 area followed by a breakthrough to the 50 level

8618610 whether it is the thawing of the northwest passage or the suspected resource riches under the arctic seabed more and more countries are taking an interest in the waterways of the canadian arctic
8618611 we will be sending a clear message to the world that our environmental standards and sovereignty are not up for debate if you are in canadas arctic you will be playing by canadas rules
8618612 some countries may object to what were doing on principle on the grounds that they may not recognize our sovereignty i expect that we will get co operation for the most part on reporting because i think it ultimately is in everybodys interest to ensure that there is some kind of authority in the area some kind of environmental and commercial authority
8618613 i think everybody understands that canada has no particular power play here this is in the interests of order and also in the interests of environmental protection

8618676 so a five to 10 minute jog would be ok but 30 to 40 minutes would not be
8618677 when running you can establish a hierarchy and have a dog that is more calm confident and secure
8618678 most dogs i deal with are under exercised and lots of times walking is not sufficient on its own
8618679 if youre an active person its easy to combine your run with the dogs walk
8618680 ideally you should jog with your dog in off leash areas so that he or she can got at his or her own pace and has the option to speed up or rest if needed
8618681 you and your dog may not have the same ideal pace and it may be difficult for your dog to match your stride comfortably or even safely
8618682 start with short distances and build up endurance over time do not force your dog if he or she is lagging behind and wishes to rest
8618683 make sure you and your dog are acclimatized to current temperatures before attempting your regular jog
8618684 even moderate temperatures can be dangerous if you and your dog are not used to them yet
8618685 since the earliest sign of heat stroke is excessive panting which may look a lot like normal panting its always best to avoid running in hot weather and choose cooler times of the day for your jog
8618686 remember each dog is an individual and may not share your love of running

8618694 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
8618695 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
8618696 second human studies where msg was added to the diet have failed to show changes in body weight and third a recently published rat study suggests that msg in the diet actually suppresses body weight
8618697 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
8618698 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
8618699 in the he et al study the average bmi among non msg users versus the highest quartile of estimated msg use was 22 3 versus 23 5 given this small difference the imprecise methods by which msg intake was estimated and controlled human studies that directly conflict with the results of this report the glutamate association statement strongly questions the broad extrapolation made by the authors

8618719 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
8618720 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law
8618721 it did not confer any right or legal status upon any baby not yet born this bill had no legal conflicts with roe v wade born and living survivors of abortion would be unambiguously considered persons medically scientifically empirically they were no different from the many premature babies who are born in american hospitals each year
8618722 this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny number one whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a nine month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place this would be an anti abortion statute
8618723 obama has also voted present again effectively a no vote on requiring parental notification not parental consent when minor children obtain abortions
8618724 i could find no instance in his entire career in which he voted for any regulation or restriction on the practice of abortion
8618725 barack obama is the most pro abortion presidential candidate ever
8618726 the first thing id do as president is sign the freedom of choice act
8618727 this bill would effectively cancel every state federal and local regulation of abortion no matter how modest or reasonable it would even according to the national organization of women abolish all state restrictions on government funding for abortions
8618728 in promising to sign this bill obama is promising to abolish state laws that protect doctors and nurses from losing their jobs if they refuse to participate in abortions
8618729 ive never seen a time when washington has watched so many people knocked down without helping them get back up
8618730 thats the america that george bush has left us and thats the future john mccain will give us
8618731 in the senate john sided with president bush 95 percent of the time give me a break
8618732 as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues
8618733 but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years a philosophy we never had a real chance to see in action until 2001 when we saw what would happen to america if the policies they had talked about for decades were implemented
8618734 obama will be a president who seeks not to perfect the lies of swift boating but to end them once and for all
8618735 this election is a chance for america to tell the merchants of fear and division you dont decide who loves this country you dont decide who is a patriot you dont decide whose service counts and whose doesnt
8618736 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas has resorted to personal attacks
8618737 how pathetic to suggest that those who question a failed policy doubt america itself how desperate to tell the son of a single mother who chose community service over money and privilege that he doesnt put america first no one can question barack obamas patriotism
8618738 ppi for july comes in much higher than expected although electricity price hikes were widely anticipated the shock value of this will come as a timely reminder to the market
8618739 sure lower oil prices are the big hope here that eventually the worst of the pressure will abate but with ppi already at such a high level it is a bit of a gamble that the amount of tightening seen so far will be sufficient and that there will be only moderate passthrough from strong pipeline pressures to consumer inflation

8618782 committed to working with the usw to reach a settlement by sept 1
8618783 that is appalling totally unacceptable it is something that is a slap in the face of our employees and our current and future retirees

8618787 i dont want to pick on any particular department because i think were all in the same bag were in serious trouble in this county and we have to face it
8618788 since the mall came in the late 70s weve lived and breathed on sales tax
8618789 penneys moving didnt help but it didnt really have that much of an impact on us hopefully next year well have something else there
8618790 we must take hold of our departments or we will be laying off people
8618791 thats a blunt as i can put it ive not said that in 32 years but at least 70 other auditors in the state have made that statement it looks like its going to get really bad
8618792 those schools will have to be taken care of somehow
8618793 id like to see the county come up with a five to 10 year plan to address these issues
8618794 well have to sit down and discuss it jefferson county has had a hard time passing their jail levies
8618795 we have worked closely with the auditors office on this project weve met with deputy auditor andy sutek dozens of times but this is the first time weve ever heard of that
8618796 we never once mentioned a jail operating levy i would be vehemently opposed to it thats my position in difficult economic times you dont go ask the taxpayers to spend more money
8618797 we will give all the support we can from the auditors office
8618798 we dont want to see people laid off in the county departments
8618799 we still feel its a little high but if we can run an additional line and pick up another 40 customers it would drive the cost down about 15 per customer per month
8618800 there would be a revolt and we would be crucified

8618829 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8618830 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8618831 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8618832 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8618833 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8618834 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8618835 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8618836 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8618837 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8618838 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8618839 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8618840 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8618841 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8618842 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8618843 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8618844 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8618845 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8618846 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8618847 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

8618889 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8618890 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8618891 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

8618898 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

8618922 yes he can but first we have to elect him
8618923 the republicans said i was too young and inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it wasnt true in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8618931 it is a testament to a lot of hard work by our delegation both clinton and obama delegates to build unity within the party
8618932 the terrorists did come on and our brave soldiers were killed because of their reckless incompetence
8618933 the time for change has come and barack obama is the change we need

8618935 george bush promised to be a uniter not a divider but he divided our nation more profoundly than any time since the vietnam war we cant afford four more years of that
8618936 come next january we will live up to our creed one nation under god with liberty and justice lets go get the job done

8618938 look at carmel and hamilton county he beat hillary rodham clinton in carmel so theres a wider acceptance and its going to evolve
8618939 i know what it feels like to go bed at night not knowing whats going to happen the next day

8618946 i dont think either paper sun times or chicago tribune is going to survive
8618947 to showcase your work you need a stellar web site and if a newspaper doesnt have that you cant be stuck in the 20th century with your old newspaper

8618961 who could well be in difficulties and in dire need of medical attention
8618962 we are therefore asking anyone who believes that they may have any information no matter how unimportant they may believe it to be to contact us immediately
8618963 they may recall noticing a female behaving strangely in the neighbourhood or at work or being absent for a time
8618964 we appeal to anyone who believes they are in possession of information not to assume that someone else will come forward
8618965 we would rather receive something twice than not at all
8618966 whatever the circumstances we appeal for her to come forward as she could be further endangering her welfare if she has not received the correct medical attention
8618967 because of what has happened she may be under stress mentally and emotionally so it is doubly important that we trace her as soon as possible

8618972 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8618973 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8618974 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8618975 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8618976 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8618977 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8618978 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8618979 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8618980 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8618981 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8618982 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8618983 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8618984 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8618985 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8618986 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8618987 we are thrilled to announce our full program of speakers and program participants we look forward to presenting a convention program that will share senator mccains unparalleled record of experience and service with millions of americans
8618988 love of country my friends is another way of saying love of your fellow countryman
8618989 if you find faults with our country make it a better one if you are disappointed with the mistakes of government join its ranks and correct them
8618990 our next president will have a mandate to build an enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom security opportunity prosperity and hope

8618993 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8618994 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8618995 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8618996 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8618997 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8618998 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8618999 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8619000 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8619001 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8619002 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8619003 together with our current fall protection operations sperian will now offer a world wide prevention solution with both collective and individual fall protection product range positioned on the high end of the market
8619004 it will also boost our position in developing territories like the middle east
8619005 the two somali nationals were robbed and then shot by the men abdi ibrahim was fatally wounded while the second man was shot on the leg
8619006 i keep thinking did the army corps of engineers fix the levees is my house going to flood again am i going to have to go through all this again
8619007 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8619008 this sends a message that washington is committed to taiwans defense
8619009 and with some sort of framework for improved cross straits relations under consideration taiwan needs to bargain from a position of strength
8619010 but the fact is unless these harpoons have some sort of magical power anything that costs 90 million isnt going to dramatically tip the balance one way or the other
8619011 my guess is that the administration was waiting until the olympics were over so as not to embarrass president hu jintao and the chinese leadership
8619012 batumi was used because it was the military assessment that it was the best port for the expeditious delivery of the relief supplies
8619013 the question of safety didnt come up we had all the cards on the table
8619014 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8619015 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8619016 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business in iraq but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else then thats where we need to be
8619017 avevo espresso degli interrogativi sulla decisione di giuliano amato di presiedere una sorta di
8619018 if we are not able to meet their expectations in that area they may not feel committed to the position or to the company and so they may leave after some years that is something we need to tackle
8619019 if employers can better understand this group of people with regards to their value system the way they would like to be seen and work the way they want to collaborate with the older generation in the workforce then i think we can better harness ways on what this group of gen y workers can bring to the business
8619020 this was a nasty attack which left a 20 year old woman with a broken jaw
8619021 we will be stepping up patrols in the area and we will work extremely hard to track down who has done this
8619022 i would also like to urge anyone who saw anything to contact us as soon as possible

8619025 out of control i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
8619026 shut the f up current mood bullied i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction i was angry when i first read his attack on me but for me i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him i am not standing in his way i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is his need to throw a tantrum for the whole world to hear is i am not going to go into a play by play defense i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him p s im not the one that is so lost that i need to use my relationship with lindsay to earn a living i am always will and always have been here for her for her not for anything else so i think its safe to say that there is not now and never will be a tell all written by me when does your book come out mr lohan
8619027 the position of the church has not changed in standing by the standard of the church which has been on for time
8619028 all we are preaching is that we need moral conversion because we are having people who claimed to be religious but not conscious of the morality to do the right thing so all we need is moral conversion towards doing what is right and through this we would achieve national growth and development

8619031 our decision to engage was made in the last second as the russian tanks were rolling we had no choice
8619032 we took the initiative just to buy some time we knew we were not going to win against the russian army but we had to do something to defend ourselves
8619033 i got a call from the minister of defense that russian tanks some 200 were massing to enter tskhinvali from north ossetia
8619034 i ignored it at first but reports kept coming in that they had begun to move forward in fact they had mobilized reserves several days ahead of time
8619035 that theyd been called up three days before from places like moscow we had intelligence coming in ahead of time but we just couldnt believe it also in recent weeks the separatists had intensified artillery barrages and were shooting our soldiers id kept telling our guys to stay calm actually we had most of our troops down near abkhazia where we expected the real trouble to start i can tell you that if wed intended to attack wed have withdrawn our best trained forces from iraq up front
8619036 some months ago i was warned by western leaders in dubrovnik to expect an attack this summer
8619037 mr putin had already threatened me in february saying we would become a protectorate of russia when i met mr medvedev in june he was very friendly i saw him again in july and he was a changed man spooked evasive he tried to avoid me he knew something by then
8619038 why should the german be interested in the liberation of the jew if the jew is not interested in the liberation of the german we recognize in judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time in the final analysis the emancipation of the jews is the emancipation of mankind from judaism indeed in north america the practical domination of judaism over the christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the gospel itself and the christian ministry have become articles of trade money is the jealous god of israel in face of which no other god may exist
8619039 i am not and never have been a man of the right my position was on the left and is now in the centre of politics

8619041 there is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved
8619042 i think its inevitable that there will be a lower standard of living than what everybody had always anticipated

8619045 il criterio seguito dalla commissione europea pericolosissimo si individuato il paese europeo che aveva il limite pi permissivo per ogni pesticida e si esteso questo alto livello a tutti i paesi membri ha spiegato francesco ferrante responsabile agricoltura di legambiente i consumatori europei adesso avranno una ben minore protezione rispetto alla loro quotidiana esposizione alimentare alle migliaia di pesticidi presenti sul mercato e una logica inaccettabile almeno i bambini dovrebbero essere sicuri quando mangiano frutta e verdura e dovrebbero poterne mangiare quanta ne vogliono lue deve rivedere questi limiti immediatamente
8619046 lue con questa legislazione ha tradito limpegno di portare i limiti al minimo livello tecnicamente raggiungibile previsto nel regolamento 369 sui pesticidi del 2005 ed a tutti gli effetti vincolante
8619047 in italia ha dichiarato rina guadagnini biologa di legambiente rimane ancora alta al 47 4 la percentuale di campioni di frutta contaminati da uno o pi residui chimici e molto significativi sono anche i numeri relativi alla presenza di pesticidi nei prodotti elaborati come vino e olio con una percentuale di 18 3 dei campioni contaminati da uno o pi principi attivi una normativa efficace e moderna dovrebbe invece considerare la questione del multiresiduo cio la presenza contemporanea anche entro i limiti di legge di pi principi attivi su uno stesso prodotto fenomeno non abbastanza studiato e del quale non conosciamo ancora i potenziali effetti sullorganismo umano e per questo la decisione della ue di aumentare i limiti francamente allarmante
8619048 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8619049 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8619050 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8619051 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8619052 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8619053 its just what i thought about doing at the time
8619054 i dont feel like doing it all the time i never said anything about doing it i just said i felt like it i didnt say i was going to

8619056 een aantal grote indiase outsourcing groepen hebben de jongste tijd de bezem gehaald door hun medewerkersbestand
8619057 daarbij werden vooral medewerkers afgestoten die de er de voorbije jaren waren ingeslaagd om de sector te penetreren zonder dat ze daarvoor de juiste kwalificaties hadden
8619058 maar de integriteit van de recruten is bijzonder belangrijk aangezien ze dikwijls met bijzonder gevoelige informatie van multinationale klanten zoals marktleiders in de financi le sector moeten omgaan
8619059 het vervalsen van kwalificaties en ervaring is altijd al een probleem geweest voor de sector maar het fenomeen is volgens outsourcing giganten zoals wipro infosys of tat consultancy de jongste jaren nog verergerd

8619063 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8619064 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8619065 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8619066 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8619067 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8619068 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8619069 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

8619075 we have a nice group of returners that will give us leadership and a solid foundation to build from
8619076 the freshmen class is a highly talented group and over time will produce the kinds of results that the coaching staff will be looking for as the program gets stronger in the years to come
8619077 liam brings stability to the staff and a vast knowledge of the program and of the competition in the conference
8619078 the biggest addition to the staff is the hire of nelson
8619079 matt brings a vast amount of pro experience with him and his knowledge of goalkeeping is at the highest level
8619080 he will give the players a person to communicate with since he has done what they are going through
8619081 he knows the trials and tribulations of what a student athlete goes through
8619082 the southern conference is a tremendous conference that has a number of quality soccer teams
8619083 the defense will be the key to our success this year
8619084 we have several returnees on the back line and they will need to hold strong so the newcomers up front can get in the flow of the college game
8619085 one thing that we have to work around is our depth pendleton said
8619086 we have the mature upperclassmen with the seniors but not a whole lot in the middle then we get to the freshmen
8619087 we are in a unique situation in goal with nobody having any experience
8619088 nelson will be critical in the improvement of these young men both are highly talented and we should see vast improvement in their abilities rather quickly
8619089 our immediate goal is to win the conference that will be a challenge playing in such a quality conference with our youthfulness each game is a challenge but a challenge we are willing to accept

8619161 fuer jede junge band ist jegliche hilfe einfach extrem wichtig
8619162 die aussicht eventuell den radioaward fuer neue musik zu gewinnen hat eine ziemliche sogwirkung in den vergangenen wochen haben immer mehr bands entweder ein neues profil angelegt oder ihr schon vorhandenes mit neuen songs und fotos aufgefrischt
8619163 das ist ein deutliches anzeichen dafuer dass wir als junge programme in der zielgruppe verankert sind und nach wie vor einen hohen stellenwert bei jungen bands geniessen
8619164 vor allem die bands die bereits mit einem profil auf der plattform vertreten sind fuehlten sich vom aufruf angestachelt sie aktualisierten ihre praesentation und machen jetzt mit frischem inhalt auf sich aufmerksam
8619165 it had to be big enough to have bodies and both cumberland valley and carlisle fit that
8619166 kids would say they were going for a run and then would hide in the bushes
8619167 but i only bring them up gradually and like to keep the gaps between race and workouts to make everything as effective as possible
8619168 the worst i had ever been on was 10th and i was definitely disappointed
8619169 they have been phenomenal from former principal bill brousse to the current ad george null
8619170 i actually feel bad for other coaches because the first thing i found here was tons of people helping at dual meets and the invite they ran on the team or their kids ran on the team
8619171 i wasnt very good but ed said i could be good
8619172 when you train with good people hurston pope and others you dont realize how fast you are then when you race other people youre faster than you think

8619174 ed says shakespeare stole my track season and he may have been right
8619175 if i dont do the play ed will go on stage and be a tree for the play
8619176 i think we could fill the place and it might be worth it
8619177 dan kept saying we miss you out here ed wont email you but he wants you out here
8619178 so you just gained 40 pounds to run cross country
8619179 ed taught me that injury is sometimes what you get when all you want is to be recognized you have to want to be good
8619180 we didnt expect that much improvement the coaches set goals in our heads and had us dream big they act like 10 year olds when they see track meets
8619181 every school has athletes they just dont know that anyone wants them to do anything id tell my football friends they could be throwers or sprinters
8619182 plus id tell them they could be good 800 runners if they ran cross
8619183 boardman is like a second father he turned me around
8619184 college choices will have to wait we want to be the best we can be and now i really get it there is a big difference between being good and being recognized
8619185 i would be very disappointed if we were not the best team in school history which was 3rd at states were aiming top three and if youre up that high you might as well fight why not
8619186 i guess that was a close encounter of the richard kind
8619187 he didnt say hi to me but you know youve got to be cruel to be kind

8619190 be prepared with the mind and attitude of christ because you are either in a time of trial and suffering coming out of one or just going into one
8619191 god whispers to us in our pleasures speaks in our conscience but shouts in our pains it is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world no doubt pain as gods megaphone is a terrible instrument it may lead to final and unrepented rebellion but it gives the only opportunity the bad man can have for amendment it removes the veil it plants the flag of truth within the fortress of a rebel soul now god who has made us knows what we are and that our happiness lies in him yet we will not seek it in him as long as he leaves us any other resort where it can even plausibly be looked for while what we call our own life remains agreeable we will not surrender it to him what then can god do in our interests but make our own life less agreeable to us and take away the plausible sources of false happiness

8619198 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8619199 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8619200 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8619201 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8619202 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8619216 pensioners young mums with pushchairs everyone uses the higher tonge post office and i am worried the pressure will be too much for the middleton general branch in the town centre if they have to take all those extra customers
8619217 this is my main concern as there is no room to open more counters to cope with the demand so the queues will probably start going outside
8619218 higher tonge has great disabled access and for elderly people and it would be a huge loss if it does not manage to stay open
8619219 the post office is at the centre of the community people just cant understand why the post office would want to close such a busy and popular branch and force them to travel well out of their way to an alternative one
8619220 we may have been put on the list after another post office was saved but we can take note of what they did right with their campaign to remain open and hope we can do the same
8619221 im pleased with my results im going to oldham sixth form now to study german law physics and english language

8619237 a leggere le notizie relative alla vicenda alitalia sorgono spontanee alcune riflessioni accompagnate da molti dubbi
8619238 il governo si appresta a varare lennesimo stravolgimento delle leggi in vigore relative alla marzano e alle norme antitrust per regalare la parte buona di alitalia ad un gruppo di imprenditori che senza rischi se la rivenderanno tra quattro anni ad air france o a lufthansa con buona pace dellitalianita della compagnia di bandiera gli esuberi previsti sono il triplo di quelli che ci sarebbero stati con la vendita ad air france dunque i trionfalismi sembrano fuori luogo infine conclude mura viene da domandarsi se la scelerata norma antiprecari inserita nella manovra economica non aveva come fine proprio quello di riservare un cospicuo numero di posti di lavoro allinterno di poste italiane per riallocare una minima parte degli esuberi di alitalia
8619239 i take issue with those who have argued that the bush ii administrations approach to u s grand strategy its determination to maintain overwhelming u s geopolitical dominance and its muscular idealism breaks sharply with the principles and assumptions that guided earlier u s policymakers nothing could be farther from the truth

8619241 defending the nations core values its organizing ideology and its free political and economic institutions
8619242 is far too deeply entrenched in americas political culture and foreign policy tradition to be dismissed
8619243 but wrights latest round of media appearances have not seemed to me to be any kind of defense of liberalism or the black church or even black liberation theology so much as one mans desire to deny a rival his destiny
8619244 the open door is as much about ideology as it is about economic expansion and the distribution of power in the international system
8619245 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected

8619253 he may feel assured he will meet with no difficulties or dangers excepting in rare cases nearly so bad as he beforehand anticipates in a moral point of view the effect ought to be to teach him good humoured patience freedom from selfishness the habit of acting for himself and of making the best of every occurrence
8619254 this chapter spells out what follows for an understanding of the nature of doctrine from the attempt to rethink the gospel scripture principle and task of theology in theo dramatic terms

8619263 this outstanding success builds on our good news from the a level results last week some of our students have performed out of their socks beating their official government targets by one grade in many cases and in some cases even three grades
8619264 we are delighted to have had a great working relationship with the class of 2008 which had a real sense of community and co operation
8619265 i am very keen on maths i really enjoy it and now i have the grades i will go to college and study maths further maths and chemistry
8619266 i have improved so much and i cant believe how well i have done i hope to become an architect which means i can combine my love for graphic design and maths
8619267 the teachers put so much pressure on us because they really wanted us to do well but i put in the hard work and i am so pleased with the results my dream job is to have a hands on type job with computers
8619268 each year i set year 11 the challenge of beating the previous years record and each year they succeed in doing so
8619269 i have been extremely impressed by the desire of the students to succeed and i am so proud that plant hill is providing more and more students with the level of examination results that can help change their lives
8619270 i am very proud of both the staff and students who have all worked so hard to achieve this level of success
8619271 i am just ecstatic and we are now building a reputation that is beginning to spread as well as producing well rounded individuals who we encouraged to reach their potential
8619272 gcses are not getting easier we are just adapting what we offer to the pupils and the staff areworking hard in different ways to help the pupils to succeed

8619280 this report is a wake up call for action towards truly living up to our reputation
8619281 there is a technical difficulty that is being worked out
8619282 our decision to engage was made in the last second as the russian tanks were rolling we had no choice
8619283 we took the initiative just to buy some time we knew we were not going to win against the russian army but we had to do something to defend ourselves
8619284 i got a call from the minister of defense that russian tanks some 200 were massing to enter tskhinvali from north ossetia
8619285 i ignored it at first but reports kept coming in that they had begun to move forward in fact they had mobilized reserves several days ahead of time
8619286 that theyd been called up three days before from places like moscow we had intelligence coming in ahead of time but we just couldnt believe it also in recent weeks the separatists had intensified artillery barrages and were shooting our soldiers id kept telling our guys to stay calm actually we had most of our troops down near abkhazia where we expected the real trouble to start i can tell you that if wed intended to attack wed have withdrawn our best trained forces from iraq up front
8619287 some months ago i was warned by western leaders in dubrovnik to expect an attack this summer
8619288 mr putin had already threatened me in february saying we would become a protectorate of russia when i met mr medvedev in june he was very friendly i saw him again in july and he was a changed man spooked evasive he tried to avoid me he knew something by then i ask everyone to consider what does it mean when hundreds of tanks can mobilize and occupy a country within two days just the fuelling takes that long they were on their way would we provoke a war while all our western friends are away on vacation be sensible
8619289 if america thinks it is too weak to do anything about georgia
8619290 you should understand how the russians see it how much moscow respects a strong united states or at least a u s that believes in its own strength
8619291 well have to fight with our own members on this

8619297 in dozens of interviews his friends said they could not remember his specific views from that era beyond a general emphasis on diversity and social and economic justice
8619298 i very likely wouldnt be standing in invesco field to accept the nomination from my party
8619299 pride in how much this country has transformed itself in my lifetime i dont think we can shy away from the significance of that
8619300 there is something that i must say to my people
8619301 eyes on the prize americas civil rights years 1954 1965
8619302 recently two men who were on the opposite sides of the debate over the vietnam war came together together they wrote that the consequences of an american defeat in iraq would be disastrous
8619303 when i am president you will be forgotten no more
8619304 with people who have a lot of gifts its hard for people to identify with them
8619305 barack obama is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8619306 there are so many things about our candidate that are different that the challenge that we have is to give people a confidence that despite all these things that feel different okay i get what hes about personally that his family is like every other family that your kids go to school with
8619307 people need to know that the president is awake gets it isnt in some cocoon or bubble somewhere
8619308 as close to street level as possible really identify with these people
8619309 waiting to see that hes angry about that stuff too not just that he thinks its wrong intellectually that hes angry
8619310 i get mad i get frustrated the thought of it makes my blood boil

8619442 anwar whatever we think of him and many of us are deeply skeptical is looking more and more like our future prime minister
8619443 there is a mounting sense of inevitability to his impending succession
8619444 we have walked out because they have refused to respond
8619445 so theres no point in staying and participating in this debate
8619446 in no other country on earth is my story even possible
8619447 is a normal everyday average father and husband in a normal every day average family
8619448 john mccain has a great biography hes been a pow ive got a funny name
8619449 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
8619450 his biography is attractive to young people but its also whys hes behind with seniors
8619451 i dont see him as being the celebrity that everybodys making him out to be
8619452 i was raised by a single parent as well my mother and turned out to be fairly successful
8619453 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8619454 i think im more in touch with the american people as far as my policies my proposals and my ideas
8619455 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8619456 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8619457 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8619458 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8619459 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8619460 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8619461 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8619462 my goal is to go out and do what i can
8619463 its a decision made by shawne and his agent tom condon after weighing all the options
8619464 shawne told me he wants to play and i said ok if he told me the opposite i would have said ok i hope everything works out for you with your surgery were happy to have him because of who he is
8619465 around every corner theres something lurking its how you handle it when you get to that corner there are all kinds of ways to react
8619466 im going to be supportive of what shawne wants to do
8619467 i see him going out and playing on first and second downs and on third downs rushing the passer
8619468 were not going to put him on the field if we dont feel he can perform
8619469 am i expecting them not to chop block because im injured people always point to the person whos going to cause destruction before a play starts and i dont think thats going to change
8619470 if shawnes not playing thats a huge loss to everybody
8619471 im elated he wants to play hes an all pro if he cant play other guys have to step up but can they step up to that level
8619472 he will probably be slapping haters left and right his hand will be covered with hate all over it
8619473 hating is an epidemic in the workplace work just isnt getting done i remember the day when you just hated within your own department hating has gotten so bad its bleeds into other departments accounting hates on communications hr hates on graphic design its chaos
8619474 hating is like a pressure in your head and to relieve that pressure you have to drill a hole and let the spirits out
8619475 we all know there will always be haters out there so all we can do is continue to not hate and just say and well keep an eye out for the haters

8619488 we hebben niet alleen het prettige erudiete stemgeluid van de heer enait in onze tomtom verwerkt maar we hebben ook veel van zijn van onschatbare waarde zijnde kennis kunnen inprogrammeren dus naast alle navigatie informatie zoals bij de volgende rechtsaf slaan of bij de volgende linksaf slaan zal de stem van de heer enait de automoblist al rijdende naar een hoger van niveau van eruditie proberen te verheffen
8619489 om een voorbeeld te geven u moet rechts af de van heutszstraat in dan zal de stem van de heer enait u niet alleen vertellen dat u rechtsaf moet slaan maar ook even een boekje open doen over deze generaal van heutsz dit icoon van de blanke suprematie in het voormalig nederlands indi en voorts zal de stem van de heer enait de post koloniale wittemans bestuurder er aan herinneren dat deze wittemans hegemonie gestoeld op de bekende plantagementaliteit in het huidige strenge islamitische indonesi geheel te einde is gekomen
8619490 we adviseren onze gebruikers van deze nieuwe tomtom echter wel nadrukkelijk om zeer op tijd van huis te gaan omdat zoals we allemaal weten de heer enait dermate veel geestelijke bagage heeft dat hij zo nu en dan lang van stof kan zijn op tijd vertrekken dus anders komt u veel te laat op uw bestemming aan
8619491 dit lijkt op zich een nadeel te zijn maar als we bedenken dat de meeste tomtomers die de stem van kim holland gebruiken halvewege de reis op een afwerkplek langs de snelweg stranden dan valt het allemaal wel weer mee de vertragingen die aan de stem van kim holland worden toegeschreven zijn gemiddeld 2 uur voor de heer enait verwachten we vertragingen van een vergelijkbare grootte en als we bedenken dat de stem van kim holland de meest gebruikte stem is onder de tomtommers is hoeft deze vertraging dus geen enkele belemmering te zijn voor goede verkoopcijfers
8619492 it is clear that the unprecedented cost of fuel and the difficult operating environment will continue to have a significant effect on the financial performance of the business and that there will be sustained fare pressure over the medium and longer term
8619493 even with the reduction in fuel prices over the last few weeks competitive pressure on fares and volumes will continue and we are at best expected to break even in the second half delivering a loss for the full year

8619555 the one thing about it since ive been here you had very few games where you had it under control
8619556 in the fourth quarter you can relax a little and enjoy it and put some other players in the game we certainly had that today
8619557 i felt like it was one of our better victories if not the best
8619558 that game plan was the perect game plan for the system
8619559 if we won in a close game i think everybody would say that it was because we were at home and we were motivated and its just a fluke or whatever
8619560 i think we had to win like this to convince everybody we were for real
8619561 for us to be an effective team we need to run
8619562 fresno state uses that unbalanced t formation and had a lot of success with it between fresno and talking to coach faurot we adopted the three back look
8619563 they just picked us apart in our secondary and with our linebackers
8619564 our linebackers were in chaos a lot and handys got to be given a lot of credit he found every weakness and exploited it

8619571 the results were better than it shows ive been working with rope pride pitching coach john roper in the bullpen on staying back

8619574 were not going to mail it in we want to win some games going out just because were not in the playoffs doesnt mean were going to fold it up and let everybody win you know what i mean weve still got some pride
8619575 i just went by on his way to the third base coaching box and told him he blew the call
8619576 and he couldnt let it go i ran by i wasnt showing him up he had to say something back which is fine but thats what ticked me off

8619578 the aim for 2012 is to be in a position to win medals in every class

8619608 harry reeders gifts of communication and leadership are legendary his new book is not only a source of spiritual wisdom but a manual on the practical application of the principles of biblical leadership within the church this book is a must read for anyone serving in or desiring to serve in church leadership as it reflects the hands on experience of one of the most effective senior pastors in america today
8619609 harry reeders concern for leader development is much more than a jeremiad against pop theories of vision casting and profit driven pragmatism his urgent call to develop biblical leaders who are courageous compassionate and selfless is a battle cry to rescue our nation our culture and our churches from the suffocation of self gratification he urges leaders to rise above idols of success and to discover their true greatness in biblical integrity generational mentoring and service to divine purposes the examples are inspiring and the challenge to change the world by honoring god throbs in the veins of the book
8619610 this book is a call and a challenge to christians it instructs and encourages harry reeder is disturbed by the thought that churches have entrusted the world with defining what it means to be a leader in this book harry reeder tries to take that job back and with it he gives us some specific help in knowing how we can develop and deploy those leaders in the church and beyond
8619611 whether leaders are born or made or both harry reeder is a leader who knows how to develop other leaders drawing on a deep understanding of scripture a lifetime of ministry in the church and a practical knowledge of military history dr reeder lays out clear biblical principles for success in spiritual leadership while at the same time warning against the dangers that constantly threaten to destroy men who serve god in ministry
8619612 harry reeder is a leader more than that harry is committed to developing and deploying other leaders it is important that a book on leadership is written by one who models what he writes this book will be a great help to any who want to produce leaders throughout our churches and the culture with godly character and servant hearts and courageous conviction with compelling and motivating examples and many practical suggestions this book will challenge you to be a leader and to develop other leaders and help you do both
8619613 harry makes the point that the best leadership models are those grounded in gods word we want to develop such leaders who then multiply through mentoring others in this way the church will impact the culture and the world such leaders are desperately needed and harry is gifted at developing them here is the methodology dont miss it

8619647 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8619648 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8619649 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8619650 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8619651 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8619652 experimentation is a very powerful tool and we use it very widely to test potential changes to search at any given time we run anywhere from 50 to 200 experiments on google sites all over the world
8619653 there is a further class of experiments the kind that are hard to miss which introduces fairly prominent features even with these larger features the goal of experimentation always remains the same are we adding something that really helps people or is this just another distraction so features need to stand on their own feet without the help of a careful explanation part of the goal of an experiment is to understand just how a feature will be used which might be quite different from what we initially intended
8619654 at this point i cant say what we expect from this feature were just curious to see how it will be used
8619655 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime

8619763 theres not enough money today to replace the infrastructure that exists today at gold fields
8619764 if you tried to build these mines today you would need a 2 000 price and higher to justify the investment

8619782 here in america and especially here tonight we need to remember two basic truths
8619783 society has an obligation and christians have a gospel duty to provide adequate and compassionate support for unwed and abandoned mothers women facing unintended pregnancies and women struggling with the aftermath of an abortion
8619784 heres the second truth killing an unborn child is never the right answer to a womans or societys problems acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that bind us all into one human family
8619785 planned parenthood is the largest single provider of abortion and family suppression services in the united states
8619786 this facility in this minority neighborhood should offend every african american and latino family and all of us because every child lost to abortion here subtracts one more life one more universe of possibilities and talent from the future of this community the business of planned parenthood is the prevention of the future and business is good and very profitable at the expense of this community
8619787 we believe that when we give the iam our final offer tomorrow our employees will see it as an outstanding offer the best in the industry and will vote to approve it
8619788 where he comes from who hes going to fight for what his change means and the contrast with john mccain and i think if we accomplish those things in some depth it will be a very successful night
8619789 the risks of continuing down the road were on which is plainly what senator mccain is offering and hes going to talk about an alternative path and the kind of future that we can build if we take it
8619790 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8619791 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8619792 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8619793 if he had his pain he put it aside and talked about how america is suffering
8619794 ive never heard him talk so compassionately about a candidate other than his wife
8619795 known and been friends with john mccain for 22 years
8619796 candidate mccain now supports the war time tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral
8619797 candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote are you kidding me folks talk about being for it before youre against it
8619798 i pray for this higher is smoking something and what the republicans want us to say very hard to do
8619799 if the hillary renegades come aboard they will get this bounce
8619800 but it wont last very long with the gop convention starting on monday by the end of the gop confab obama will have a small lead
8619801 four to six points in some states say colorado less in others that are polarized along racial lines say most of the south
8619802 conventions dont get the attention that they did in the past and if he gets a bump it will be small
8619803 we are in middling times the base vote represents about 45 percent support at any given time leaving a relatively small percentage of truly undecideds big swings are not realistic no matter the drama of the conventions
8619804 piggyback conventions and mccains pick of a vp on friday will keep the bounce down
8619805 this race has become quite polarized quite quickly id be surprised if there was a bigger bounce than this
8619806 five points of obamas bounce disappears after the gop convention well be back to a dead heat by mid september
8619807 the choice between obama and mccain is so stark that most people have made up their minds and that puts a cap on the size of any bounce
8619808 the days of big convention bounces are over smaller television audiences and back to back conventions cancel out the potential of a big bounce
8619809 the race is already fairly locked in with limited room for movement and the republican vp pick and convention will serve as an effective bulwark to arrest any significant momentum
8619810 there has been little movement in the race overall and the timing of the republican convention will likely offset any significant gains during the democratic convention
8619811 the republican pit bulls have already framed the democratic candidate going into the convention and will further undermine him with a barrage of ads that appear to make it difficult for the convention to move many voters
8619812 there just isnt much time for a bounce the republicans start pounding on obama on monday in prime time and that will take a short term toll
8619813 historic how late and close together these conventions are taking place not much room for bumps
8619814 the convention is already a success but it ends on thursday and then mccain will name his veep and then the gop convention takes place
8619815 everybody needs a place to rest everybody wants to have a home dont make no difference what nobody says aint nobody like to be alone everybodys got a hungry heart

8619817 this is a very real tragedy and our condolences go the family of claire

8619820 a 21 year old male arrested in connection with the incident has been released on police bail whilst further enquiries are made to ascertain exactly what happened
8619821 ill be alright i just wish people didnt have to be so cruel and careless
8619822 ive lost everything i ever wanted will you be okay
8619823 so a five to 10 minute jog would be ok but 30 to 40 minutes would not be
8619824 when running you can establish a hierarchy and have a dog that is more calm confident and secure
8619825 most dogs i deal with are under exercised and lots of times walking is not sufficient on its own
8619826 if youre an active person its easy to combine your run with the dogs walk
8619827 ideally you should jog with your dog in off leash areas so that he or she can got at his or her own pace and has the option to speed up or rest if needed
8619828 you and your dog may not have the same ideal pace and it may be difficult for your dog to match your stride comfortably or even safely
8619829 start with short distances and build up endurance over time do not force your dog if he or she is lagging behind and wishes to rest
8619830 make sure you and your dog are acclimatized to current temperatures before attempting your regular jog
8619831 even moderate temperatures can be dangerous if you and your dog are not used to them yet
8619832 since the earliest sign of heat stroke is excessive panting which may look a lot like normal panting its always best to avoid running in hot weather and choose cooler times of the day for your jog

8619954 over the past years this initiative has passed a long evolution from the idea of establishing peace and confidence in the asian sub region and all way through the practical mechanisms of collective diplomacy two cica summits were held to usher in new mechanism for maintenance of international safety on the continent the institutionalization phase in the forums evolution is complete now
8619955 it would be expedient to take practical steps towards establishing and strengthening cooperation in military and political dimension which in a long run should become one of the major dimensions of the confidence building measures catalogue

8619960 consider the choice between the immediate cost of building thicker roads in the first place and the long term cost of repairing thinner roads as they wear down an economic calculation would have suggested much thicker interstate highways even ignoring the cost of disrupting traffic with repairs but the interstates were built relatively thin in part because of political pressures to get the system spread everywhere as quickly as possible now theyre wearing out and money must go for repairs that investment while necessary is inefficient and yields a relatively low return

8619965 as an american my heart is full tonight when i consider how far our country has come in nominating an african american
8619966 that said it is important not to merely get swept away in the moment but also to consider senator obamas record
8619967 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8619968 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely

8619977 the clock for the german labour market is literally ticking it is only a matter of time before the economic slowdown will be felt

8619999 we know that realising this ideal will be a lengthy process and commit to working innovatively cleverly and with resilience to realise the capacity funding and structures to achieve this
