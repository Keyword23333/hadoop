3600009 it is not every day that 1 600 of your fellow compatriots are killed in cold blood
3600010 i think that its too early to make any final judgments because we are talking about a complicated situation
3600011 the aggressor has been punished and his military forces routed
3600012 i think russia is getting more nationalistic and i think its been strengthened in this reasserting of sovereignty
3600013 is what is at stake when russia engages in behavior that looks like it came from another time
3600014 is as much interested in the relations with russia as russia is in the relations with the united states
3600015 when were trying to negotiate a resolution with the russians
3600016 russia wants membership of the wto but it needs to play by international rules
3600017 europe and russia want a wideranging partnership and co operation agreement
3600018 but this needs all sides to play by the rules business as usual is not compatible with russian aggression in georgia
3600019 a lot more to lose than the soviet union did in 68

3600021 after the euros plunge on friday the aussie and kiwi opened on monday with a huge gap down forcing margin traders to cut positions
3600022 there has been a buildup in their leveraged positions so unless there are buyers on dips there may be deep adjustments in these currencies
3600023 the dollars recovery remains vulnerable as its rise has been dependent on developments in external markets such as oil and stocks while there are still few reasons to buy the currency
3600024 market players are unsure how long the dollars rise will last against the euro and how much more oil and commodities prices will fall the dollar may quickly reverse course and start falling as soon as oil and commodities prices resume their climb
3600025 people need to call and police need to react to that call otherwise these people will think this is a heyday for us well just go and keep on doing it and thats whats been going on up until now
3600026 a good 14 year old boy from a good family
3600027 we need information from the public particularly those that live in and around the house
3600028 we would also like to hear from anyone that may know who these offenders are or what the motive for the attack may be
3600029 you can try everything you can but numbers are limited resources are limited and you cant predict what someones going to do
3600030 we should be searching out the people who are delivering this stuff weve got the most beautiful country in the world the greatest country in the world being destroyed by drugs
3600031 i am anxious that we may be facing another situation where an innocent person is the victim of a violent crime

3600036 limiting sonar use in breeding grounds and other key habitat areas is essential for the conservation of whales dolphins and other marine mammals
3600037 this agreement protects both national security and our most treasured natural resources
3600038 we get some areas to train and they get some areas that are off limits
3600039 the chinese are keen to show they are in control they dont want to spoil the olympic party but there is no doubt this is a significant escalation
3600040 it is not just the quantity but the quality of the attacks that has changed they are becoming more dangerous
3600041 security should not become in any way a cover to try and deal with dissent
3600042 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3600043 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3600044 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3600045 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3600046 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3600047 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3600048 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3600049 in true hollywood style with lots of action and magic
3600050 i always believe you work hard and you play hard and i think this will inspire everyone to work hard
3600051 i will not go on vacation i will not leave the state i will not do anything until i have a budget
3600052 they have been very busy working on hundreds of different bills that have nothing to do with the budget
3600053 if the governor feels like he can go to the border governors conference and still negotiate the budget then go ahead
3600054 i think the reason the governor is frustrated is because he actually has to sit in the building and figure it out with us
3600055 the more hes out of the capital or out of the state the more his critics can say look arnold is traveling all over while california workers are being asked to take a huge pay cut

3600061 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3600062 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3600063 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3600064 when it is slow like this i cant help but think of the past
3600065 you have got to stop thinking about him darling thinking about him will not bring him back plus someone is doing some heavty revenge for you
3600066 all the members who sentenced gears to his grave were all killed tonight the murders happened within a few seconds of each other the weird thing is that the murderer is mechanical it is like someone is programmed to do this very thing
3600067 but no one knew vincent like i did no too many people are that inventive to make such a machine plus no one gave a damn about him but me
3600068 be very careful they may pin you as the accomplice to the murders since you are the only one so close to gears im just saying
3600069 how else would the police react to this eight bodies found in one night them finding the name too is madness
3600070 the media has been updating this event all night as soon as something happens they are there asking questions grabbing as much information as possible i swear to god vikki that they are just as bad as some computer viruses
3600071 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3600072 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3600073 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3600074 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3600075 they had an understanding of the times to know what israel ought to do

3600077 we continue to successfully develop our network brands on the internet online advertising revenues were approximately 20 1 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared with 19 3 million in the second quarter of 2007 year to date online advertising revenues were 36 4 million in 2008 compared with 34 7 million in 2007
3600078 each time a person stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance
3600079 did i ever think this would happen naw not in a million years this is beyond my imagination
3600080 if we can stabilize some of these costs we can provide good jobs for the future of these young people
3600081 with this increase the number of those using a search engine on a typical day is pulling ever closer to the 60 of internet users who use e mail arguably the internets all time killer app on a typical day

3600088 was not hillarys supporter never not ever not for a day
3600089 that may be by the time he got through working on it that was probably true
3600090 thats easily to be understood from his comments and i just beg to differ with that because the fact of the matter is all the stuff that i saw reported were reports on things the president said from his own mouth
3600091 most people thought that the most telling thing back in january was the equation that the president made of jesse jackson having won south carolina caucuses 20 years earlier and compared that with obama winning the south carolina primary theres a big difference in a caucus and a primary
3600092 and so a lot of that irrespective of what the president may have meant by the statement a lot of people interpreted that as having a racial connotation and jim clyburn didnt speak on that issue at all
3600093 i dont know that ive done any surveys to determine whether or not the president former president has ever damaged himself or not
3600094 my gut tells me that some things i ought to keep to myself
3600095 a nightmare is much more intense than a bad dream it can arouse feelings of fear horror and distress it replicates our deepest fears and can reflect the different types of stresses we face in our waking world
3600096 nightmarish thoughts such as losing your job being homeless falling and being chased are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3600097 for example dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life the attacker or falling in the dream represents the emotion of fear and anxiety
3600098 its no wonder gordon brown and alistair darling are making a special appearance in our nightmares at the moment both symbolise the fears we are facing in todays economy
3600099 just shake it off thats all you can do shake it off
3600100 this is a most serious game of military brinkmanship with major nuclear armed powers that have profound objections to the neo con grand strategy and to western control of all of the middle easts oil supply
3600101 the controversy over the georgian surprise military attacks on south ossetia and abkhazia on 8 8 08 makes a closer look at the controversial georgian president and his puppet masters important an examination shows 41 year old mikhail saakashvili to be a ruthless and corrupt totalitarian who is tied to not only the us nato establishment but also to the israeli military and intelligence establishment
3600102 barack obama as the candidate promising change is revealing his true colours much to the despair of anyone actually expecting any change
3600103 a totalitarian governmental system led by a dictator and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism militarism and often racism

3600105 send the guard into our streets during a public health emergency terrorist attack or other condition
3600106 the president and his lawyers now claim the authority to designate any american citizen he chooses as being an enemy combatant
3600107 the president can designate people enemy combatants and detain them for whatever reason he wants there are no charges and prisoners have no lawyers no family visits no court reviews no rights to anything and no right to release until the mythical end to the war on terror
3600108 he was blindfolded his ears were blocked he was manacled and then put into solitary confinement for 76 days forbidden mail television or anything to read except the koran his family was not allowed to visit him his lawyers were told he would face execution but within six months the u s government had dropped all criminal charges against yee
3600109 aggressive men who have no clear accountable relationship to the government or the party seeking power

3600112 valued for their expertise in kidnapping torturing and killing defenseless civilians
3600113 we should worry about the men held at guantanamo because history shows that stripping prisoners of their rights is intoxicating not only to leaders but to functionaries at every level of society
3600114 established a network of illegitimate prisons where torture took place
3600115 a sharp increase in u s citizen groups that are being harassed and infiltrated by police and federal agents often in illegal ways

3600123 at a point in both mussolinis and hitlers takeovers citizens witnessed a stunning series of quickly escalating pronunciamentos or faits accomplis after each leader made his bids for power beyond what the italian parliament and the german reichstag allowed him each abruptly started to claim all kinds of new rights that were extra parliamentary the right unilaterally to go to war to annex territory to veto existing laws or to overrule the judiciary
3600124 the piper matrix fills a niche in the market that hasnt been truly addressed until now to date our entire first year of production is sold out and market demand continues to be very strong
3600125 we should take into account white kids who have been disadvantaged and have grown up in poverty and shown themselves to have what it takes to succeed
3600126 finally i have all the time in the world to do this

3600128 i felt a little sick last night but i was up for the challenge and tried to get the best out of myself
3600129 its something that i dreamed about for a long time its the ultimate goal ive put a lot of effort into the preparation for this race
3600130 it was so great for me to have them pushing me along it got the best out of me
3600131 it hasnt really sunk in whats happened im trying not to think about the end result before i finish swimming but im happy with what ive put into this meet and happy with what ive achieved
3600132 its a big surprise its a new event any medal at an event that is not on your program is gear

3600138 i sold most of my stuff on the way up and thats my style
3600139 people that understand and know my strategy very well would not be surprised to hear that because my strategy is always to put the most money in my best idea in terms of risk reward today
3600140 they are having a field day i hope the short sellers enjoy themselves because this is very short term thinking
3600141 it is an old very wise thing that in commodity markets you shouldnt be short its dangerous
3600142 clearly our production will vary from month to month but we are targeting to ship 2 000 metric tons in 2008
3600143 so far management has been unable to provide evidence that high production volume in the 1 000 tonnes range can be achieved concomitant with high purity and low cost
3600144 weve been under such scrutiny i was afraid it might have gotten into the wrong hands
3600145 we took a short term hit for the long term health of the business

3600154 coach bob bowman said to me after the 200 freestyle youre tied
3600155 whether the heats or the final are in the morning and the afternoon does not matter to us in terms of performance
3600156 i think in this day any loyalty is very lacking in sport and i think that often money talks too loudly
3600157 i just think when it comes to issues like that there are certain traditions that need to be followed
3600158 i hate to lose getting third in the 200 four years ago when i lose in circumstances like that it motivates me even more in the past four years ive been able to make some pretty significant drops in the 200 especially underwater i was watching my kick outs and thats all i can ask for
3600159 ive been eating a lot of pasta and pizza a lot of carbs

3600164 the scope for future monetary policy easing may be more apparent
3600165 the data is likely to show a further rise in unemployment the figures will confirm that we are entering a crucial stage when the decisions taken by the bank of england and the government will have a major impact on how many jobs are lost as the slowdown bites in 2009
3600166 the bank of england needs to address growing expectations of recession across the economy by cutting interest rates to boost business and the government needs to put more money in the pockets of public sector workers to raise flagging consumer confidence
3600167 the labour market data should show a faster pace of rising unemployment
3600168 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3600169 and if they think also that somehow its all going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3600170 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness then you count me out i think it will be an absolute disaster
3600171 eventually you break the backbone of the polymer chain to the point where its not useful
3600172 we have materials that are competitive today with existing nano filtration and some of the brackish water membranes
3600173 we are now pushing the chemistry to get further into the seawater area which is a significant market wed like to access
3600174 if were successful well have the possibility of basically making these membranes on the same equipment that people use today
3600175 this work is among the most innovative and interesting research on membrane materials in the past decade
3600176 while the chlorine tolerance exhibited by these membranes is impressive the basic separation performance is not yet where it needs to be for these materials to be touted as immediate replacements of commercial seawater membrane technology

3600199 pure coincidence but there was a stack of color action photos of dunn on bruces shelf and that was no coincidence
3600200 he gave em to me and i just decided to bring em
3600201 im absolutely going to miss dunn even more so than ken griffey we had a relationship before i got to the big leagues working out together in texas during the offseason and he worked his tail off
3600202 were still going to be friends but this place is a lot different now
3600203 were moving forward and we have to accept it for what it is and the way it is you cant give up just because people are gone you have to move forward nothing stops for anyone in this game the show must go on
3600204 what we have now are three center fielders jay bruce in right corey patterson in center and rookie call up chris dickerson in left
3600205 and hes better than last year and thats exactly what i like to see a guy improve
3600206 right into the fire tonight getting called up i expected it
3600207 i played center most of the time but the past couple of years they emphasized me moving around i played left a lot when jay bruce was at louisville and he played center we rotated and got our fair share of experience
3600208 dunner made it clear to some of us in the clubhouse that his asking price is 120 million to 125 million
3600209 thats it theyre saying they are not going to build a strong team here
3600210 if they keep the pitchers they have now well be all right i think theyll go out and sign some hitters if we didnt have a veteran manager like dusty baker i might be concerned but im not
3600211 felt like a whirlwind for the first couple of innings
3600212 i was almost relieved with the five pitch walk to start the game then i stole a base and that relieved the pressure
3600213 and it was like a thousand pounds came off my chest
3600214 it was an exciting first couple of innings especially with those balls in left field
3600215 best play i ever made in the big leagues yes
3600216 the way weve been playing i was not going to let that ball get past me i was going to do everything possible to stop it
3600217 we played a good game tonight offensively and defensively edinson threw a great game and thats where it starts it got hairy in the seventh but javy made a great play down there
3600218 that one play won the game plus he hit a home run off me on a pitch i placed perfectly down where the catcher wanted it and he whacked it
3600219 he was throwing strikes but he was a little bit more wilder than he was the last two times when he didnt pitch as well
3600220 he threw a lot of strikes the last two performances so maybe he needs to be just a little wild
3600221 may be if i have a game like that ill be happy to be a little wild

3600246 i do not think this is the time to be holding onto foreclosed homes and hoping for a better day
3600247 current severities are rising much faster and in probability will be higher than the mid 1990s peak
3600248 in the last five months there has been a dramatic increase in sales which correlates to the decline in prices

3600251 we just basically give him a little training and try to just keep him happy
3600252 but it could have an effect later in the week
3600253 thats my job im trying to think about my plan and are we on it
3600254 i think one of the reasons ive been able to be like this is because ive been there before

3600270 the new series is in the very early stages of development and will encompass storylines in both sydney and melbourne a nine network spokeswoman said
3600271 weve gone through a fairly extensive process over the last month and we had an excellent range of candidates and were very pleased to secure guy
3600272 were starting to put the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle together weve had our first year signings with the kids and now they can see who their coach is its starting to take shape
3600273 our expectations are that in the next two years he will put together this young list
3600274 the development of the players both individually and as a team will be his prime focus but were just as much leaning towards wanting the type of person with the leadership skills to really build the culture for a young club
3600275 as we all know in footy a lot of this comes from leadership driven by the coach and we saw bluey as someone who possessed those leadership skills sort of had a strong character about him and someone with a wealth of experience of coaching and development so we thought he ticked all the boxes
3600276 if youve got any heart drop them off they are like gold medals to us

3600278 i opened the door and he pushed me from behind
3600279 i said why are you doing this what do you want
3600280 its been a hard 18 months this is the last thing my mum needs
3600281 he could have taken them all so long as my mum was ok

3600285 i see that it takes a lot of practice and one day i sort of want to be in the olympics
3600286 we had a couple of walk ins yesterday that saw parts of the olympics
3600287 just be aware this is potentially toxic to cats as well as dogs
3600288 im not going to be part of the olympics because of chinas involvement with darfur

3600290 youre supposed to put 3 rolls of quarters and that is 30 there
3600291 awaken their child at the same time each morning and reduce afternoon naps
3600292 i mean one of these days were going to be right the odds are just with us on that but im trying to remain optimistic and patient with this because waiting on wainwright and carpenter well actually getting them back thats huge but were definitely walking that fine line now because we dont have a hell of a lot of time left
3600293 you get in a game a guy goes down here a guy goes down there and you need to have that insurance
3600294 if somebody can play offense and maybe a little defense and be a contributor on special teams thats just more value
3600295 hes such a great athlete and has played the position before
3600296 it was a lot easier then than it is now
3600297 and the more things you can do the better its definitely a positive thing i know its not like im going to come out here and be a starter
3600298 it felt good to be back out there with pads on and hitting a couple of people
3600299 im just focused on getting all the way back healthy so that when the season opener comes around im ready to go full steam
3600300 youve got to be able to trust all your limbs all your muscles if theyre going to perform the way you need them to when called for
3600301 im pretty sure i can run it just as fast without
3600302 those two guys have done things a lot of people have never done before
3600303 that would have been on my mind the whole time
3600304 not as many guys run on me but i feel off
3600305 thats why im doing my stuff every day to work on it i feel strong just out of whack
3600306 yadi is smart enough to know the difference he sees he has to rush and that gets him out of his groove
3600307 it was something i never thought id get a chance to do play in the olympics represent my country and win gold
3600308 we had a lot of pride when we played and we were all amateurs there wasnt a pro guy in it we could all have gone to pro ball we sacrificed that for the olympics none of us negotiated contracts during that time to be a part of it
3600309 i felt like i was driving the ball pretty good
3600310 well work him for a day or two get an eyeball on him for ourselves
3600311 at some point soon hell be activated we want to take a look at him
3600312 i dont know what theyll do but i would bet theyll temper his play early and he wont be a 30 carry guy on opening day if hes back by then
3600313 weve got to adjust our preparation once he gets in sooner than later obviously would be better we do have a plan for it and that plan will be ever changing based on when he does come in
3600314 carl peterson did a study for the kansas city chiefs
3600315 hes one of the most experienced presidents general managers in the national football league
3600316 hes been there since 1989 and hes done studies as to holdouts not only in kansas city but all through the league he says theres a much higher correlation or a chance of getting injured after holding out regardless of position
3600317 we had a lot of injuries last year and we had everybody in camp
3600318 a lot of thats bad luck in a lot of ways i think as long as jacksons training and we do a good job of training him getting him ready to be honest with you that really isnt a concern
3600319 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race

3600321 the republican party today was assessing the potential political fallout
3600322 revealed wednesday that he was repeatedly molested by an unnamed republican congressman in the late 1990s
3600323 authorities have not acted on haggards allegations saying that republicans are often accused of wrongdoings simply because so many of them lead secret gay or criminal lifestyles
3600324 republicans who have leaned enormously on the vote of conservative christians in recent years already reeling from a series of congressional scandals
3600325 top house republicans knew for months about e mail traffic between representative mark foley and a former teenage page but kept the matter secret and allowed mr foley to remain head of a congressional caucus on childrens issues
3600326 convinced the relationship had become romantic some of his top advisers intervened to protect the candidate from himself
3600327 to his advisers even the appearance of a close bond with a lobbyist whose clients often had business before the senate committee mr mccain led threatened the story of redemption and rectitude that defined his political identity

3600335 we have roughly half a million samples in the dna database in florida those get uploaded into codis which is a national system
3600336 once the dna sample is collected from the convicted offender it is processed at the database lab in tallahassee they receive approximately 10 000 samples every month
3600337 every profile you add into this collective system you enhance the odds ultimately of solving some crime
3600338 once that dna profile is entered into the database it is compared against all the other profiles that have been entered into the database and these profiles are searched every week
3600339 since 1992 weve solved roughly 9 000 crimes as a result of hits made in the database
3600340 in the early 90s it was two three four five hits per year to last year in florida we solved i think 2 193
3600341 without that we might not have solved this crime we certainly wouldnt have solved it today
3600342 i will never deny training to our teachers they need all they can get but i do question where were sending them

3600349 well thats what your son said he said you couldnt come to the phone because you were still sleeping
3600350 i was not sleeping i was upstairs and they were downstairs and they were too lazy to come up and hand me the phone i was wide awake
3600351 oh by the way my two cents aka susan my dear friend in california called and wanted you to call her back

3600355 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3600356 that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3600357 we believe some animals were left behind that were not fed and some of the puppies got to him
3600358 not intentionally attacked him but used him as a food source theres just not a nicer way to say it
3600359 they just didnt know any better and he was on the floor incapacitated for a couple of days and became a victim of that
3600360 any problem with record keeping and documentation in aircraft maintenance is a concern because thats one of the things that underpins the safety of the plane
3600361 is it just a maintenance documentation problem or was there a failure to do any maintenance work
3600362 we understand that we are young we understand that we dont have the experience thats all we hear
3600363 thats understandable and its true because we havent done anything in this league yet
3600364 you feel bad for bobby but its the nature of the business other guys get the opportunity to at least show what they can do show their potential
3600365 thats the way we looked at it thats the way bobby looked at it
3600366 theres no pressure added just go out and play football
3600367 we all realize that its now a great opportunity for a lot of receivers and with the situation were in now it kind of magnifies a little bit more
3600368 but our approach is to stay calm try and stay relaxed and not to think about added pressure
3600369 i honestly thought i was going to play defensive back thats what the coaches told me and what a lot of the guys wanted me to do but when i got there they were having a lot of receiver problems
3600370 thats all i remember is them saying were going to give you a shot at wide receiver and i was like ok i was just happy to be there
3600371 hes got great skill hes fast i mean his athletic ability is special

3600375 he gave us inroads he showed that only people with the community in their soul were the ones who could be effective
3600376 i dont even like to stereotype and say gang members i say theyre disenfranchised youth
3600377 they dont really have all the tools to make the right decisions thats necessary in todays society and they dont fully understand the system
3600378 bo would tell his personal story of being a former gang member who would not let gang life trap him into a sense of hopelessness and despair
3600379 and he talked about working hard and not making excuses
3600380 you dont find many in the gang intervention world who can be effective in the street effective in the courtroom effective at city hall and effective in the prisons he could calm everyone down and make us work together
3600381 he helped bridge that divide by setting the example of partnership

3600388 it was ricky who helped make history in the house of pain
3600389 personally i think ricky has proved himself as south africas leading scrumhalf
3600390 is it fouries world cup status that now elevates him above ricky in my view fourie has done nothing to justify a place in the starting lineup

3600392 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3600393 the georgian government has accepted the elements of a peace agreement that the russian government previously said it would be willing to accept
3600394 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3600395 it is time for russia to be true to its word and to act to end this crisis

3600414 my vision is for the next generation of australian businessmen and women economists accountants lawyers architects artists film makers and performers to develop language skills which open their region to them
3600415 we were satisfied with some of the things we set out to do but obviously we never get so excited by a score like that as it tends to mask things that you dont do that well
3600416 we are definitely happy with the guys performance but we will go back tonight and look at what we did and what we can improve on for the next game
3600417 when you get a lot of opportunities like that you like to put in a few more of course you wont get that many opportunities against probably a dutch side or a spanish side
3600418 we do the same amount of homework as we do for the dutch teams like that south africa you dont play very often and sometimes you have to do a lot more homework

3600427 we see that hizbullah has been receiving many rockets including anti aircraft rockets and un resolution 1701 the ceasefire that ended the second lebanon war is not being implemented
3600428 the very fact that we are training with live fire and with every soldier fully equipped and in an officers training course
3600429 is part of a vital process led by the chief of staff this past year and a half that will bring about a change from the very foundations in our readiness and ability to carry out these operations during actual wartime if and when this is forced upon us
3600430 returning to its right values to the right training and it is our obligation as a government to make sure that the necessary means are available to carry out these exercises intensively and correctly
3600431 they have been receiving modern weapons including anti aircraft rockets and the ceasefire is not being implemented what are we supposed to do its no coincidence that we are training here in the golan heights not far from lebanon so intensively and on such a large scale
3600432 we are doing what we are supposed to be doing regarding the rest i prefer not to talk about it but rather if and when the need arises simply to do it
3600433 but also with the help of heavier warheads some that can reach beer sheva dimona and the negev thus that from this standpoint the entire country is in their range
3600434 our country is one in which our security is comprised not only of tanks and planes but also of the pursuit of excellence dealing with soldiers as individuals education welfare and the like life and security come before quality of life and in a country like ours we do not have the luxury of cutting our defense budget

3600593 i feel its insulting to women to remove a vulva because of somebodys attitude

3600618 we australia do stand to render any assistance if that will help in terms of ceasefire and also in terms of humanitarian assistance because we do have regrettably very many displaced people
3600619 we will give serious consideration to anything we can do on the humanitarian front

3600625 but this is a case where on the surface it looks like we have tried to use the system to obstruct entry of new zealand apples

3600641 i guess you can no longer sit back and allow communist infiltration communist indoctrination communist subversion and the international communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of your precious bodily fluids

3600650 you know there are three styles that businesses want traditional contemporary and one other thing
3600651 uh huh this is really just a basic resume which i used for generic jobs
3600652 i see you didnt put a colon after your subject headings what style is that
3600653 which version of word do you guys have in here 2003 or 2007
3600654 thats ok im certified in both so its not a problem
3600655 in keyboarding we always do two thats what im certified in see keyboarding have you ever taken keyboarding
3600656 have i ever taken keyboarding well in between building computers programming them in 6 different languages using them to animate polygon meshes in the millions of vertex range and having a four year degree in a computer dependent field i really didnt see the point nor could i find the time to spend two days a week for an entire semester learning where the enter key was just so i could impress a future employer by telling him her outdated bullshit like putting two spaces after a period
3600657 yeah we did a little of that but we stuck with keywords like pink green red and blue we didnt get into any hexadecimal yet
3600658 well have plenty of colors to work with before we need to do that
3600659 actually html only supports about 25 or so standard colors without resorting to hex
3600660 well theres actually about 6 million colors did you know that

3600664 between making the lineup and challenge matches this can be more nerve racking than trying to get to state
3600665 there are some butterflies because you dont know what the coaches want
3600666 the only way to get rid of them is to play well
3600667 i really want to make sure they understand what i want them to do which for me is serve return and keep the ball in play

3600672 its part of the cost of being able to live here and talk about football and stuff like that all you have to do is watch the olympics to figure out the rest of the world doesnt quite live like we do
3600673 we found out yesterday and to be honest it sucks
3600674 to see this happen to someone who came out here and worked his ass off and wanted it so bad and is a great guy to have this happen to him is unfortunate we loved having him around
3600675 we go out after games together we travel together and have fun together

3600690 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

3600699 you gave up the extra pair of hiking socks because they would add 6 ounces now you want gloves
3600700 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3600701 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3600702 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3600703 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3600704 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3600705 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3600706 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3600707 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3600708 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3600709 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3600710 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3600711 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3600712 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3600713 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3600714 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3600715 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3600716 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3600717 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3600718 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3600719 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3600720 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3600721 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3600722 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3600723 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3600724 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3600725 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3600726 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3600727 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3600728 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3600729 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3600730 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3600731 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3600732 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3600733 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3600734 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3600735 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3600736 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3600737 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3600738 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3600739 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3600740 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3600741 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

3600761 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3600762 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3600763 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3600764 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3600765 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

3600770 this really the state of the art of the state of the art
3600771 i wasnt able to read the eye chart out of the left eye at all
3600772 its made of an array of about a thousand lenses
3600773 and it takes the light and divides it into two pathways and then reconstructs the depth of field image we see
3600774 oh my its amazing i mean im really stunned by this picture
3600775 what was the first thing you saw when you opened your eyes
3600776 there was no veil over the left eye anymore i saw color
3600777 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3600778 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3600779 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3600780 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3600781 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3600782 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3600783 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3600784 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3600785 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3600786 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3600787 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3600788 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3600789 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3600790 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3600791 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3600792 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3600793 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3600794 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3600795 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3600796 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3600797 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3600798 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3600799 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3600800 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3600801 who are open to doing something on the production side
3600802 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3600803 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3600804 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

3600808 im not going to deny that there are issues between us im a primitive man born in todays time i cant fake anything if there is a problem then im not going to deny it weve had problems before also but this time i dont think we can sort them out we are two different people our values and way of thinking are different i dont think we can be friends i think its better to declare that then put on a fake fa ade of being friends and back biting each other
3600809 i am what i am thats the way i am if you like it then thank you very much and well if you dont like it sorry
3600810 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3600811 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3600812 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3600813 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3600814 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3600815 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3600816 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3600817 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3600818 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3600819 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

3600838 its a matter of the parents and the community and the society developing a change in our culture we must advocate for zero tolerance we must work as hard as we can to eliminate it

3600861 the last couple of years its been a good league but one of the downfalls has been the limited number of games in the season
3600862 so it will be good to have a longer season and i guess that helps australian based players in regards to making the national team as well
3600863 if there are more games there are more chances of making the national team as well
3600864 obviously the league had to land on its feet first we all knew when it started that eight wasnt enough but the league had to establish itself and i think its well and truly grounded now
3600865 its ready for another couple of teams and hopefully they get it right
3600866 hopefully theyre financially viable and all very competitive on the field and if thats the case its great news for the league to get another two teams and make the season a bit longer and more aligned with the european amount of games
3600867 i do support expansion but its just one of those things that if they can only have one team and they make sure its a strong one team then thats great
3600868 because at the end of the day you want to have a product thats a good product
3600869 i think we are definitely in a position to bring one in whether thats the gold coast or wherever it may be i think over time well see the league expand
3600870 we have reached the stage where the whole situation needs correcting
3600871 we need the excesses skimming off the top it is difficult to say that without making it appear that we are trying to sanitize everything
3600872 that is not what we are saying at all we want the passion and rivalries what we dont want is some of that blatant disrespect and abuse
3600873 im slightly concerned ill be the first sent to the stands as i was last year for a rather innocuous decision last season
3600874 but i think the ideas terrific to cut out the excesses
3600875 at times and this came into sharp focus last season incidents crop up where the mark is overstepped and player and manager behavior can become unacceptable
3600876 the referees have a responsibility too in forging better relationships with team captains and the other players and by communicating in the right way it will help the players and that will make the game better for everyone
3600877 its unfair to pick one person or player or one club
3600878 i could show you a hundred videos of players committing offenses weve all done it
3600879 thats the past and we move on to make better every club and player who has committed an offense whether that be us haranguing the referees over the last year or so if we dont stand up and take that responsibility we wont move forward
3600880 weve all seen where we want to go and stop surrounding referees the respect is definitely there
3600881 referees have got a tough job and dont have access to replays we realize that

3600908 esta atividade agr cola foi totalmente esquecida nos programas de desenvolvimento rural dos ltimos governos estaduais e este ano foi atropelada pelo o incentivo ao cultivo da mamona promovido pelos governos estadual e federal por m com resultados t o negativos que a petrobras j fala em descartar a mamona do programa do biodiesel
3600909 sendo a maioria deles rendeiros dificilmente encontrariam parceiros senhorios quase todos pecuaristas que permitissem o cultivo dessa oleaginosa em suas terras em virtude desta planta n o ser adequada para alimenta o animal

3600916 the maqasud of the law giver is the fulfillment of the interest of the slaves in their lives and in the hereafter shariah all of it is filled with hikam purpose and with masholih benefit interest in this livelihood and in the hereafter
3600917 all of the shariah are adl justice all of them are rahmah compassion law all of them are mashalih benefit and well being and all of them hikmah wisdom purpose
3600918 therefore any solution to an issue if taken from justice to injustice or from rahmat to lack of it or from benefit to harm or from wisdom to vainness such solution or approach has nothing to do with shariah even if it were to be made so by the power of interpretation

3600965 i took the ferry to governors island and on the way back a thunderstorm came with large gusts of wind the waterfall started blowing onto the island soaking the people waiting for the next ferry
3600966 from brooklyn bridge park you can see the waterfalls at the brooklyn bridge and just north of the manhattan bridge
3600967 i would say that without getting the business background it would have been fairly impossible to take an invention anywhere
3600968 so what we had to do is start teaching entrepreneurship to engineers
3600969 not so long ago if an engineer had a small invention he would just hope that there would be someone on business side that would recognize brilliance and see the application
3600970 most of the time it would have died right there
3600971 to help develop and motivate the next generation of energy entrepreneurs
3600972 what we try to do in terms of the course is to give them the sense that there is a structure in place for how to present your ideas
3600973 we give them a framework for how to approach business situations
3600974 ability to analyze problems in a different way by focusing on a need in the market and working backwards to an invention

3600983 yang lebih memperihatinkan bullying nyaris sudah terjadi di banyak sekolah selama bertahun tahun kasus bunuh diri yang dialami beberapa siswa sekolah sebagian diakibatkan adanya bullying yang dialami anak fakta ini jelas memperihatinkan karena dampaknya sangat luar biasa terutama bagi korban
3600984 tayangan sinetron juga membentuk skema kognitif pada anak yang mengakibatkan mereka cenderung menjadi pelaku bullying cirinya anak memiliki kecendrungan motif dasar agresivitas resa rendah diri yang berlebihan dan kecemasan
3600985 sebaliknya jika sekolah sudah melakukan upaya menghapus bullying orang tua juga mesti mengimbangi dengan memberikan pendidikan yang baik di rumah jangan sampai di sekolah sudah dididik dengan benar di rumah mendapat perlakukan keras dari orang tua
3600986 i really enjoyed this website i got so caught up in reading i for got i was cooking and by accident burned the rice but i dont mind this site is great
3600987 man the winner or winners of this thing are going to be contacted about jobs or writing a book how cool is that
3600988 he looked a lot better than the last couple of times we faced him
3600989 he had pinpoint control we came in to the clubhouse and watched some at bats on tape he was hitting the outside corner and the inside corner
3600990 i just left too many pitches over the plate tonight
3600991 and they took advantage of it i kept the ball down for the most part but when it did get up they hit it pretty hard
3600992 thats the kind of pitching we need from our starters right now
3600993 were in a pennant race and we need good starting pitching
3600994 just a couple of bad pitches and thats the game ups and downs
3600995 you want to play good defense behind him we didnt do that its tough for him because we should have played a lot better defense behind him
3600996 its a play you should make an easy catch but what can you do make excuses no
3600997 it wasnt like really pitching i wasnt even wearing spikes i just got on the mound and threw about 50 percent but what i did felt good
3600998 thats a good sign we see if today it reacts the same way id like to have him available in this series
3600999 the problem is i havent been able to push off
3601000 if i try that and it still hurts ill have to tell them hopefully that doesnt happen
3601001 i know im going to get suspended i just dont know when or how long
3601002 obviously we are very disappointed with the decision victor made
3601003 we educate our players on what supplements are permissible by mlb and our players know the consequences if they choose to use any banned substance

3601009 oh im sure it is have you seen this place
3601010 you should forget the baseball game you have and come with me to the wedding i would rock your world
3601011 did you see all the lights go out when you were out there scary
3601012 when he gets ahead of the count and makes sure hes around the plate this is the type of game you see from him
3601013 i felt like ive been throwing the ball well the last few starts but a mistake here or there cost me
3601014 today i didnt have any mistakes i feel really strong and healthy and we have only two months left important months too
3601015 he found his changeup again which had kind of been gone for a little while
3601016 he had his normal slider and his slow curveball that he can throw with two strikes he pretty much had four pitches going all night
3601017 the main thing to me is how we play tomorrow
3601018 the last two series we face kansas city we do the same thing we win the first game and all of a sudden we lose the series i hope these guys remember that the way i do
3601019 other than the mistakes that he made for the home runs he pitched much better
3601020 theres not a ton of results right now but i think im getting closer to where i need to be to help this team win a lot more ballgames in the future
3601021 i think this teams built around home run hitters i just hope people are on base when we hit home runs
3601022 there were two balls that definitely should have been caught and we couldnt find the handle
3601023 all i had to do was set basically he did the rest
3601024 i dont know why id just rather have it that way of course if im playing poorly its nice to have phil get a serve or two but in general i enjoy that challenge
3601025 its kind of a mano a mano thing i guess
3601026 i am not too tall and it is pretty difficult to try to side out against phil
3601027 just the same as it being humid out here everyone has to deal with that too so its the same for everyone
3601028 gostei deste blog os assuntos s o variados e bem escritos tem um aspecto global bonito e navega o r pida parab ns

3601032 miner good tigers bullpen smells like a bag of weekold doggie doo left in the steamy hot sun
3601033 i feel like a beginner its totally different different gun different pull different everything
3601034 its like a marathon runner switching to hurdles or a swimmer going to diving the similarity is they both use a pool filled with water skeet and double trap are like night and day
3601035 i know its only been two days but im very very pleased they went through a great offseason conditioning program and stuck with it honestly i couldnt be more pleased
3601036 with freshmen included we had 280 kids out there that first day were just ready to go
3601037 but were not in the best shape theyve retained a whole lot and thats sort of a luxury of having a lot of third year players that have been here since day 1 were doing the right things heading the right direction but our conditioning level has to come up
3601038 when you have a year like we did when we struggled at times it becomes a long summer and you can wait to get back on the field and improve its good to get things going
3601039 throughout the 18 years ive been on the coaching staff we usually do have a spring practice i guess last year was abnormal
3601040 even with waiting a week to start now im glad we did it this year we answered a lot of questions early for us
3601041 were concentrating on adding quality depth something we didnt have last year
3601042 one of our weaknesses was what we were doing up front were working on getting stronger on the defensive and offensive lines thats where were targeting
3601043 we evaluate our situation every year and then the coaches get together and decide if we should go in spring or start early in august
3601044 we had it last year and usually do its something well evaluate again after this season we do whatever works best for us
3601045 i feel like you can take that time and get in 18 workouts on a more calm pace more at your own pace
3601046 i think about this time of year you get so caught up in school and a bunch of different things going on
3601047 the kids came back with great retention so far having spring ball has always been the right thing to do for us
3601048 you always have one or two kids that get bigger and grow stronger in the offseason and you need to make adjustments to your depth chart friday will be the first test in pads and from there well look to fill the roles with our team
3601049 the front line looked pretty good but i still think we need to work on our ball control the front line played aggressive and i like that
3601050 they didnt let them have too long of a run and i think the largest lead they had was four points
3601051 that is one thing we are working on not let anyone have too many long runs on us
3601052 they can i know we went down in three games but i see a lot of good things going on out there we are just lacking some communication and i think confidence i think as soon as we gather some confidence within this team and find some leaders have some leaders step up in leadership roles i think we will be someone to reckon with
3601053 so far mr oguin has come in and done everything that weve asked of him
3601054 one thing that we are real pleased about with him is his global view of the student athlete he is especially aware of the girls side of the program
3601055 a lot of the newness has worn off mainly because there is so much to do
3601056 so far our practices have been real intense we are requiring our kids to rise to the occasion in these practices
3601057 both torian and c j were on the sprint relays that went to state last year so they are pretty fast
3601058 c j also finished second in the triple jump at state so he is pretty athletic
3601059 he is a natural leader and a very hard worker
3601060 he keys in every morning before everyone gets here comes in and watches a lot of film he just has those intangibles that you cant teach
3601061 we are going to rely on him taking that slot position on offense and use that 4 4 speed of his
3601062 we are excited about the speed of these two defensive ends
3601063 my son started four games at marshall as a sophomore so he knows how to get in there
3601064 we have a new defensive coordinator and we want to give him the fastest kids that we have
3601065 they are fired up about the season and hopefully that energy will carry on over to district play
3601066 our goal is to make the playoffs but hitchcock is loaded and they are the team to beat danbury has a great quarterback and them along with boling will make a run but tidehaven has responded well to its coach
3601067 so we just hope at the end we have one of those spots
3601068 i think we are ready they are tired of practicing
3601069 i know i keep harping on this but this has truly been a team effort where everybody is stepping up
3601070 one team that sticks out is ohio valley because their team has made it to the world series as 13 year olds 14 year olds and now as 15s
3601071 we look for them to be pretty stout the pacific southwest from california always has pretty strong teams as well
3601072 but our kids are excited about going up there with an attitude about the team and not individuals
3601073 they know that if they play as a team everyone will reap the rewards if they win
3601074 we dont know what pitcher will start but chances are it wont be william easter brandon bergen or manuel hernandez
3601075 but it could be james cantu or alex rankin i dont want to get ourselves in a situation where we fall behind either so they will all be on a short leash up there
3601076 he is our big boy in relief and has just done well when we asked him to pitch for us
3601077 what i plan on doing is keeping a couple of pitchers on the bench and keep them warmed up just in case id rather have them warmed up on the bench than have to pull them from the field and they only get eight warm up pitches
3601078 up to this point ive only had two middle infielders but with eddie back in the fold i can have more options for chad barker and james bennett
3601079 he is still not 100 percent but in certain situations we can use him
3601080 it is all about confidence and he is just seeing the ball real well
3601081 with his vision right now he tells me he is just seeing everything that is coming at him
3601082 defensively we are very strong because we can play several players in different positions
3601083 but we have been concentrating on hitting the ball and we brought in several pitchers to throw at them because we want them to be ready
3601084 your market your revenues your farm system i never felt the pressure to do something that didnt make sense
3601085 the trade of the year if they make the playoffs
3601086 investigation of attempted murder after his former girlfriend was critically injured when she was stabbed more than 20 times
3601087 arrested for actually murdering his ex girlfriend in a fit of rage
3601088 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
3601089 theres still a lot of recovery to come but shes using the help of her friends and family on a scale of one to 10 she is certainly not there yet but she is progressing
3601090 penelope had less facial hair than a guy so it was certainly more pleasant it was better than kissing jonathan rhys meyers in match point kissing him wasnt that bad but he did have to stop and shave in the middle of a scene even though hed shaved that morning the man has really got some beard on him
3601091 i do think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here pointing to her beehive
3601092 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit
3601093 love each other very much and want everyone to know that the matter was completely blown out of proportion

3601095 onshore industrial projects such as lng terminals refineries and plants like the one involved in this contract are more often constructed in remote areas
3601096 to limit onsite construction modular construction is the solution while modules are fabricated at yards in china or korea the massive content of some of those projects adds substantial additional logistic challenges it is here where the capabilities of the dockwise organization combined with the flexibility of its large versatile fleet provide clients with cost effective solutions

3601111 the idealistic impulse toward protecting individuals from overbearing state authority has resulted in a system where we deny people the opportunity to take responsibility for their criminal acts in our system a man or woman who takes responsibility must be crazy
3601112 t here is little evidence that a significant number of guilty people are going free because of the miranda warning the chief reason for this is that contrary to expectations most people under arrest do not keep their mouths shut and do not ask for a lawyer even though it is almost always in their interest to do so
3601113 our citizens confidence in the criminal justice system will be strengthened by ensuring that the rules will be fair to crime victims as well as suspects will protect the public by helping convict those who voluntarily confess their guilt and will promote honesty and accuracy in criminal trials by allowing the jury to hear all truthful evidence a society that beats confessions out of suspects has lost its morals but a society that rejects a suspects voluntarily given confession has lost its marbles
3601114 when people around the world go to the movies they see a bad guy who has just murdered a nun impaled a policeman and blown up a school collared by eastwood or stallone or tommy lee jones what are the first words out of the good guys mouth you have the right to remain silent the viewer has to wonder what kind of political paradise america really is people seeing this in belgrade and harare and kuala lumpur places where the innocent get whacked and beaten and tortured at the whim of the authorities can only be awestruck at a country that treats even its monsters with such delicacy
3601115 who invokes their right to remain silent or especially their right to counsel the usual suspects the hardened criminals the ones who have been through the system many times before or who come into it well heeled and well counseled these offenders dont need the warnings to understand their rights and they are quick to assert them for all the rest miranda amounts to little more than red tape just another part of the ritual of putting on the handcuffs and making the trip to the station miranda does little if anything to protect the most vulnerable suspects
3601116 in the common view miranda was necessary to protect accused criminals from being forced to confess through coercion or torture
3601117 unless miranda warnings are a totally impotent gesture there must be some percentage of suspects who invoke their right to remain silent who would not have done so some subset of that group in turn presumably would have gone on to make truthful confessions that would not have been involuntary in the classic beaten out of him sense and in some subcategory of that subset the confession would have been crucial to building a case against that suspect

3601149 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3601150 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3601151 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it

3601163 the u s is a great place to get sick but its a terrible place to stay well
3601164 heres hoping that americas voters arent as silly as its pundits
3601165 we unfortunately had a previously scheduled commitment on the date proposed
3601166 if we do not i can almost promise you nrg is going to be tired of the city and say were trying to give you some canals
3601167 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3601168 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3601169 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3601170 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3601171 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3601172 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3601173 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3601174 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly
3601175 i get tired of cops always having an attitude right off the bat
3601176 its not like i robbed anybody to have that attitude with me when all i did was cuss
3601177 you just cant go off swearing and hollering you just cant do it
3601178 your market your revenues your farm system i never felt the pressure to do something that didnt make sense
3601179 the trade of the year if they make the playoffs
3601180 all i had to do was set basically he did the rest
3601181 i dont know why id just rather have it that way of course if im playing poorly its nice to have phil get a serve or two but in general i enjoy that challenge
3601182 its kind of a mano a mano thing i guess
3601183 i am not too tall and it is pretty difficult to try to side out against phil
3601184 just the same as it being humid out here everyone has to deal with that too so its the same for everyone
3601185 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3601186 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3601187 an offense report was not written on this situation and an arrest was not made
3601188 however a citation was written and that is not public record under rule 12
3601189 the document is presumed open to the public unless sealed by court order
3601190 grew up with it from like when i was a baby
3601191 the age of the kids is the difference now and their access to firearms
3601192 we have more drive by shootings than we had a decade ago but the most alarming thing is the youth getting in and the violence there we have to address those issues
3601193 its the environment that theyre in that puts them at risk i just think its terrible that youve got 17 year olds killing 17 year olds to me theyre just babies
3601194 we dont mess with anyone for no reason just go up to someone and fight
3601195 our gang is not just about shooting people we got morals no mothers no children but you do what you got to do
3601196 id rather just be doing barbecues and kicking it but its my own fault im in this deep
3601197 when i was a young kid i thought it was cool and stuff you know to be in a gang when i hated my mom and my mom left me when i was a little kid these guys were there for me they put food on the table there was always somebody i could call
3601198 you are in a gang this is serious i guarantee that one of us sometime is going to jail
3601199 we dont want to put no one in the hospital
3601200 if they come out with a broken arm or something theyre no good to us
3601201 i personally dont want to die but im in what im in
3601202 thats the scariest part about the shit that im doing but thats the way it has to be thats one reason i pay taxes to take care of me and my family
3601203 when it happens it happens you just tend to know when somethings going to go down
3601204 who cares whats the point you only live one life what does it matter basically its retarded half my familys hoover halfs blood and were killing each other off
3601205 seattles gang problem is small compared to other cities but it definitely holds its own
3601206 its a bunch of teenagers i would call them delinquents that have adopted a gang name or identity and that identity automatically falls into a structure of rivalries that those members must participate in to these young people their identity as a sure o or a crip or a blood is as serious as someone elses identity conflict over religion like the shiites and the sunnis thats an identity conflict the irony is theyre all the same theyre all muslims youre all young people from seattle
3601207 my friends had to help me home because there was so much blood i couldnt see
3601208 i look at these kids now and think you guys are ridiculous i call them mtv gang members thats what they are to me gangs arent good anyway but now its just a mess
3601209 people might hear its random violence but almost all of these murders are connected its central district versus central district south end versus cd and south end versus the west side its everybody against everybody you have generational affiliations jurisdictional and neighborhood its very complex actually
3601210 we all got to die thats what im saying dont matter if its in a good way or a bad way
3601211 i dont know if ill be around in five years
3601212 i already lived a life you can be through a lot and be really young so if you die you die with knowledge about whats really going on
3601213 its not worth it but if it happens it happens
3601214 if ive got to shoot somebody im gonna shoot em
3601215 we can get these kids focused when theyre here sort of as a captive audience
3601216 when allen got shot i felt real sad but more than sad i just felt like doing anything to somebody who wasnt from deuce 8
3601217 i wish i knew who did it cause i would have did something before i got locked up but thats one reason ive thought about not being in a gang because i didnt want to have to do something cause what i was thinking about wasnt cool
3601218 my dad was the first person who let me smoke and stuff he used to joke about me and my brother being in different sets ones here the others down the block hed laugh about it
3601219 my grandma had died and then when my dad got locked up me and my brother we thought we dont really have much else now im quieting down im not trying to die
3601220 but i got used to it gang life its just something i formed around these are people ive known forever and weve always been this way
3601221 beezle even though hes from a rival gang i dont want to lose him
3601222 but i like to do positive stuff too i dont like to just attack people id rather play football
3601223 i thought they had literature they had rules this was an organization but the truth of the matter is it was the same old thing gangbangers
3601224 our mission was to sell drugs and shoot guys from other gangs i thought it would be different but it wasnt
3601225 theres love in the club i felt love in the gangs love in the streets but its a war mentality
3601226 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3601227 tidak ada satu pun alasan yang bisa membenarkan serangan semacam itu
3601228 georgia juga harus menahan diri untuk menggunakan kekerasan untuk menyelesaikan krisis di ossetia
3601229 it paralyzed him for a little bit but hes walking around pretty good now thats good news thats the only good news we got tonight
3601230 the concern was there and youre hoping for the best
3601231 it hit him good and theres not a lot of meat on those bones
3601232 hes a great competitor and i like the way he goes about his business
3601233 the guys a 300 plus hitter every year for a reason
3601234 i put him in a hitters count and hes not going to make a mistake
3601235 hes a lot like roy when roy first came up
3601236 if he learns to pitch like roy has hes going to be tougher all the time
3601237 we found out there were subdivisions platted many years ago that were not developed
3601238 our intention was to protect people in neighborhoods but our order was far reaching
3601239 when approached by constituents about discussing and considering their concerns involving firearms and bow and arrow hunting i asked that the concern be placed on the agenda like any other concern
3601240 it was discussed and considered and we voted unanimously to approve the order
3601241 i certainly do not mind admitting we may have acted hastily and before hearing public input
3601242 perhaps we were making an attempt to help when help was not actually needed
3601243 if we can make it site specific well revisit this
3601244 he was a tender heart and such a sweet little boy
3601245 im so sad my heart is just broken forever that he couldnt come home on the plane with us and that happened
3601246 they need help for final expenses obviously with this gentlemen not having insurance and no license or anything like that
3601247 i dont think it would be appropriate to comment on a pending investigation
3601248 effective this day i hereby resign as chairman of the juvenile board
3601249 it has been my honor and pleasure to serve in this capacity
3601250 it would not be appropriate to comment at this time on the current ongoing situation and investigation
3601251 he was so drunk he actually jumped into the trunk
3601252 i think you like your weed and you like your ecstasy and im saying sometimes situations go bad and i think an altercation happened and you cleaned up the house loaded kenneth up into the trunk and borrowed a shovel
3601253 and you believe that as long as theres not a body no one can pin things on you
3601254 you keep on telling us youve got nothing to do with kenneth but you have his wallet employee id card and his checkbook
3601255 the man gave you everything you met him one day and he gave you everything
3601256 when they found the shovel and started talking to me i thought that was the strongest point of evidence
3601257 would be kind of hard because you just have to drive until you find a good place
3601258 i believe that he believes he is involved with a special relationship with a deity or someone called god
3601259 i believe he led a healthy productive life as a child
3601260 somewhere around 14 he began to go astray he became hate filled and resentful for being held back put down and this cauldron of hate began to grow
3601261 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3601262 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3601263 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3601264 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3601265 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3601266 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3601267 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3601268 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3601269 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3601270 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3601271 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3601272 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3601273 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3601274 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3601327 dehein will not lay a finger on you he would never harm any of my allies i want to explain everything you have the right to know
3601328 the hermits are our allies trust me we have worked hard with one another the past several centuries they help us travel across the oceans and even create weapons for me and your father hermits are skilled in some magics as well as science they only eat vampires that we gift them
3601329 what do you think we do with those we catch mary
3601330 depends on the crime another thing the hermits are sometimes used as our information system they give us leads on some of our hunts dehein may even know something about this rumor

3601353 you passed out before the two of you could progress intimately kami was indeed disappointed

3601427 what were trying to do with our team is develop these mathematical models so that when theres a disease outbreak health officials have some idea how to answer what if questions
3601428 its very important for health officials because they need to figure out which groups they should target to stop the disease from spreading
3601429 once you understand how much interaction there is you can actually start predicting when you think the disease will get to other groups
3601430 we cannot just say were sitting here in canada we dont care about whats going on elsewhere outbreaks in one part of the world other parts of the world are vulnerable

3601432 if scientists work with people in china to try and understand whats going on maybe you could prevent outbreaks in other places like canada

3601450 weve asked mike skinner to evaluate areas where we can improve our on track performance
3601451 i thought he did a really nice job of working with red bull and aj allmendinger earlier this year and our no 00 champion mortgage team could use the same experienced insight
3601452 but this is the toughest most competitive form of racing in the world and i know michael and mwr can benefit from skinners input
3601453 i support doing whatever it takes to improve the performance of our team
3601454 no driver wants to get out of the car but i understand that every part of our program needs to be evaluated and that certainly includes me i plan to support mike skinner and our team any way i can and hopefully learn some things that will help when i get back in the car
3601455 i think what makes it special is hes so good in this environment

3601458 thats my job im trying to think about my plan and are we on it

3601464 we now know this is frank marshall davis a full fledged communist of the strongest kind he is one of the few in america who did not leave the communist party after stalin was revealed for the monster he was obama seemed to be trying to hide this by not naming him directly
3601465 anybody who tells you he was active in progressive causes in those days and never worked with the reds communists is a goddamn liar their platform stood for all the right things

3601474 should not be surprised at the nationalism of kashmiris there has been a facade of normalcy in kashmir tourists coming and mobile phones arriving do not mean that people are not angry
3601475 wasted chances to come up with a creative solution with pakistan and kashmiris
3601476 i think the blockade made people realise that kashmir at the moment totally depends on india and that we need to be economically independent
3601477 the excessive and unwarranted use of force against the people of indian occupied kashmir
3601478 these statements constitute clear interference in the internal affairs of an integral part of india such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
3601479 the first thing is the whole event is very undesirable in terms of both the domestic situation and its linkage with the larger bilateral peace process
3601480 i see this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through a bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive

3601499 we now know through recent windthrow that volume to be considerably less

3601513 its obvious that it professionals have been worn out by the onslaught of developers and vendors security bulletins one of the companies released 72 security updates last year almost one every five days burnout is why some 200 000 sql server systems were unpatched and wide open when the slammer worm struck even though the company involved had issued a patch for the flaw six months earlier at the time under survey even microsofts servers hadnt all been upgraded allowing slammer to take down many of the companys hosts

3601525 qantas discovered an irregularity with paperwork for these aircraft during an internal integrity check of maintenance records

3601527 thousands of other republicans are going to be picking country over party in this election
3601528 my goal is to let republicans have a clear understanding that their right to vote should not be restricted by party affiliation
3601529 one candidate john mccain who has always put country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3601530 i have a record of reaching across the aisle reaching across the aisle and working with my friends whether it be joe lieberman or ted kennedy
3601531 fuel prices reached record levels faster than fares could be adjusted especially in a quarter where we were facing ramp up of our new flight networks
3601532 we are taking all possible measures to lower costs and reduce fuel consumption to offset the recent increase in fuel prices
3601533 pinnacles operations rebounded in the second quarter to the industry leading performance that we are known for
3601534 in addition colgan reported almost breakeven operating results on the strength of its new q400 operations in spite of a nearly 69 increase in fuel costs related to its pro rate operations
3601535 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3601536 and im not saying we are reigniting the cold war but this is an act of aggression in which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century
3601537 for mccains team it has become the latest incarnation of what
3601538 you got a guy who is ready to be president on day 1 who understands the world for what it is
3601539 the thing about sen obama hes playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia
3601540 sen mccain has talked for years about the dangers of russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbors
3601541 there is a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience
3601542 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
3601543 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
3601544 russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3601545 he was not calling for equivalence between russia and georgia he was calling for a ceasefire to stop the violence after russia invaded it was a totally different order of magnitude
3601546 it is based on an exaggerated and deliberately misleading perception of senator obamas initial statement which was issued early while the crisis was unfolding
3601547 this is an attempt by people supporting senator mccain to politicize a great international tragedy and its not worthy of the dimensions of the problem especially when both candidates have roughly the same position
3601548 part of the reason we dont have leverage is that we dont have a u s russian relationship it has been adrift
3601549 its easy to say something belligerent about russia im no friend of vladimir putin and cheap shots about tough talk are all well and fine but what are you doing to actually make the situation better
3601550 this type of bluster is fairly counterproductive because it is a bluff theres nothing we can do about this
3601551 it has become a race to be see who can be the tougher i cant see anybody suddenly stepping back and becoming a voice of moderation and calling for calm

3601578 to make the right judgment hitting exactly on the root of the problem is to really and successfully achieve the alleviation of poverty of the people especially to achieves the millennium development goals which require each country to have alleviated poverty by 2015
3601579 samdech dekchor stated that the national road 7 is not just a trunk road for a joint development program of cambodia laos and vietnam but also it shows new evidence clearly the involvement of our country by implementing the infrastructure development policy of the royal government by strengthening the transportation system all over the kingdom of cambodia to facilitate commerce and to push the development of rural areas and tourism and to integrate these within the region and with the world
3601580 i still adhere to the stance to continue to restore and build more infrastructure to be the basis of the internal integration by connecting to every area throughout the country the cities populated areas and remote areas and to continue to integrate the region to facilitate business
3601581 the construction of infrastructure represents an actual success and it helps the transport within the economic sector very well

3601586 she went on to say that the success in the construction of national road 7 is also one more great achievement of the chinese cambodian cooperation

3601590 samdech dekchor stated that the national road 7 is not just a trunk road for a joint development program of cambodia laos and vietnam but also it shows new evidence clearly the involvement of our country by implementing the infrastructure development policy of the royal government by strengthening the transportation system all over the kingdom of cambodia to facilitate commerce and to push the development of rural areas and tourism and to integrate these within the region and with the world
3601591 i still adhere to the stance to continue to restore and build more infrastructure to be the basis of the internal integration by connecting to every area throughout the country the cities populated areas and remote areas and to continue to integrate the region to facilitate business
3601592 the construction of infrastructure represents an actual success and it helps the transport within the economic sector very well

3601619 after several tests we decided to put lin miaoke on the live picture while using yang peiyis voice
3601620 the reason for this is that we must put our countrys interests first the girl appearing on the picture must be flawless in terms of her facial expressions and the great feeling she can give to the people
3601621 i think they are most definitely going to be psyched out

3601662 when nothing is working like you want it to and the other player is playing well you have to just hang in there
3601663 it was either that or go work a real job
3601664 and right from there i was out to prove that i was worth more than 1 000 i said to myself that id get that 1 000 back someday
3601665 i knew i was worth way more than that i just had to go and prove it all over again
3601666 a scouts judgment a player development persons judgment matters but not as much as a players judgment of himself

3601669 ive got the rest of the season and then theres next year and the following year and the year after that theres always something and as long as i have that ill be able to be the kid who had nothing and showed us he wasnt who we thought
3601670 i feel like a beginner its totally different different gun different pull different everything
3601671 its like a marathon runner switching to hurdles or a swimmer going to diving the similarity is they both use a pool filled with water skeet and double trap are like night and day
3601672 its the most ive ever trained for an olympics ive been averaging 1 000 rounds a day ive also got mental training as far as trying to learn all the leads and pull points a thousand times a day getting the gun from the hip on top of the shoulder
3601673 occasionally there has been what do you call it mob scenes where he has to find his way to get to the bus or the car for sure
3601674 i feel that im always welcome im like a chinese player in the peoples mind
3601675 yes mr waldner is the most famous swede in china
3601676 i think his reputation will hang in there for years to come hes always an asset we have in mind when we have important occasions because hes so well known
3601677 i think if you take the asian players compared to me they are more like machines when they play they always do the same things when they are playing
3601678 in the free time i play a lot of golf instead of table tennis now its more relaxing
3601679 im not cooking so much anymore im taking the beer more

3601686 im not cooking so much anymore im taking the beer more
3601687 i personally feel there are a lot of restrictions that should not be there
3601688 people who get these carry permits are extremely law abiding citizens
3601689 those who have no regard for the law are carrying guns anyway
3601690 but what we saw was only one side having the chance to express themselves
3601691 firearms on college campuses and schools those are some very serious issues
3601692 the idea that somehow law enforcement can make a distinction between someone who is intending to commit harm and someone who is intending to defend other people thats a false distinction
3601693 thats not something law enforcement can figure out on the front end
3601694 electricity prices may rise up to 5 percent but this is notenough at all
3601695 even with a significant increase in power costs it would bedifficult to predict improvements in future earnings
3601696 it solidifies us as the place to go for the cool stuff
3601697 we do believe that broadening our assortment and having iphone in our stores is certainly going to be very important

3601731 an offense report was not written on this situation and an arrest was not made
3601732 however a citation was written and that is not public record under rule 12
3601733 the document is presumed open to the public unless sealed by court order
3601734 certainly the death penalty could be sought in every capital case tried but that would clearly be a decision made without regard to thought of anything other than emotions
3601735 it makes no sense but points out even more so why we must look at case law in our evaluation process
3601736 if we do not i can almost promise you nrg is going to be tired of the city and say were trying to give you some canals
3601737 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3601738 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3601739 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3601740 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3601741 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3601742 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3601743 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3601744 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly
3601745 i get tired of cops always having an attitude right off the bat
3601746 its not like i robbed anybody to have that attitude with me when all i did was cuss
3601747 you just cant go off swearing and hollering you just cant do it
3601748 the movie is unique in the sense that it concentrates more on the fact that the story development comes from the characters themselves
3601749 she really does get into her character role which really may have jumpstarted her career
3601750 oldman also does a great job playing a corrupt drug addicted dea officer who is also a murderer
3601751 weve always tried to keep it up but when my husband got sick there was no one to pick up and do things that needed to be done
3601752 homeowners are getting to feel proud of their house again
3601753 these people have owned their home for fifty plus years
3601754 theyre ecstatic just to see their home look kind of new again
3601755 if we could have had another 10 or 15 crews that would have been marvelous
3601756 we were off to a slow start this year but the community came through with flying colors
3601757 a widget like this is clearly at the sweet spot
3601758 it appeals to the right demographic its useful and its also fun
3601759 there are a lot of smart people and big companies working on widgets
3601760 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
3601761 madden is the absolute most consistent video game in the industry
3601762 theres not even the slightest fear this title will flop
3601763 men line up at midnight to buy the game then take the day off of work to play it
3601764 have taken profits as theyve seen demand destruction in the u s and theyre seeing it spread a little into europe
3601765 the question is where will the number level off at for china in the next few months
3601766 china is an enormous driver for the price of oil along with india brazil and the middle east
3601767 i think a drop of 20 percent is a bit over done
3601768 weve fallen too far too fast i expect the market to sit between 110 and 120 in the short term
3601769 when what you love gets taken from you you want to know the truth
3601770 i try to apologize for what i have done for what i am but it never makes it any better
3601771 hey zacka hey its hmm i dont know but may be along the way you take my hand well tell a few jokes and have some fun hey how do you get to the met
3601772 because to the force of survival anything beyond 65 would be the same
3601773 they know that were coming back to redeem ourselves and im pretty sure that they watch us a lot
3601774 has been circled on my calendar for about two years now
3601775 weve got veterans were preparing ourselves every night were showcasing what weve been doing the last three years getting ready for this moment
3601776 so we cant afford to go out and be lackadaisical
3601777 we were not looking ahead i thought we played with really good energy in spurts and played some really terrific basketball
3601778 our goal wasnt to win by a certain margin it was to really work hard and keep up our pressure and then once that was done we just worked on a few other things the main thing was just to keep some consistency so overall i was very pleased with tonight
3601779 but when it comes to his record american made motorcycles like harleys dont matter to john mccain
3601780 back in washington mccain opposed a requirement that the government buy american made motorcycles
3601781 and he said all buy american provisions were quote disgraceful surprised you shouldnt be this is the same john mccain who supported billions in tax breaks for companies who ship american jobs overseas
3601782 hard to tell the truthfulness itll have the fact checkers working
3601783 lastly i am also disappointed that the bill once again this year contains a department wide buy america requirement and specific language directing the secret service to purchase american made motorcycles i firmly object to all buy america restrictions as they represent gross examples of protectionist trade policy from a philosophical point of view i oppose such policies because free trade is an important element in improving relations among all nations which then improves the security of our nation furthermore as a fiscal conservative i want to ensure our government gets the best deal for taxpayers and with a buy american restriction that cannot be guaranteed
3601784 i dont know of any district that has gotten out of fiscal emergency that hasnt done two things pass levies and make cuts
3601785 i would say the 30 million and the 15 mills was what we needed
3601786 what we know having gone through this past year is the community simply cannot afford that kind of a levy
3601787 people never ran over me the way she ran over me anyway
3601788 i really think it does have an impact and the friendship does stay as long as they have a positive experience
3601789 people are coming from diverse backgrounds and different areas around us so sometimes its a culture shock
3601790 those media have definitely changed the face of assignments to some degree because students are able to communicate with each other and find out about each other very quickly
3601791 if we find a topic that has a common interest we do a franked mail piece out to constituents
3601792 if you read these pieces you have a very different picture of his record than you would by looking up his actual record
3601793 my opponent never likes my record because shes running against it
3601794 we do everything we can to make sure we maintain a two way conversation with the constituents of our district
3601795 rep boehner wants to make sure that were communicating in the most cost effective way possible
3601796 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3601797 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3601798 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3601799 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3601800 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3601801 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3601802 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3601803 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3601804 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3601805 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3601806 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3601807 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3601808 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3601809 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3601810 how that goes sometimes can make the rest of the year good bad or indifferent
3601811 people need to realize this isnt just for the fire department
3601812 this is really for the people of the township its for their safety as well
3601813 i know weve got a good fire department a good response time and good equipment but its a little late to pay your 60 extra for a levy when youre waiting for an ambulance
3601814 the more severe their slowdown the greater the likelihood that it will begin to cool the boom in exports
3601815 the weak dollar has become a major driver of economic growth
3601816 yes virginia there is such a thing as post racial politics
3601817 attention iowa democrats please organize a search party for dlc chairman harold ford thank you
3601818 im hillary clinton and i did not approve this message
3601819 paging john edwards and barack obama your republican talking points are calling
3601820 ted kennedy endorsed obama to preserve jfks civil rights legacy what legacy
3601821 while the decision to leave was very hard for mike and we will miss him greatly the combination of this business potential and a return home to oregon were simply too powerful to ignore
3601822 es kann nicht sein dass die linke sagt sie w hlt j rgen walter nicht

3601824 menurut keterangan saksi 4 orang pelaku berboncengan mereka menghampiri korban salah satu pelaku menodongkan senjata api jenis pistol dan pelaku yang lain mengancam memakai senjata tajam jenis golok
3601825 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3601826 what was strange was seeing a bright spherical white light higher in the sky for a while that then disappeared
3601827 it looked almost like the first aircraft was either with it or investigating it
3601828 a few minutes later we saw another intensely bright spherical white light coming back towards us from the castle hill direction
3601829 were not definite enough on detail or what mix of unusual plane ufo or astronomical phenomena this may have been
3601830 but two of us saw the same stuff and both thought it was very strange
3601831 i was woken by the noise and just saw a really bright light with a bit of a tail on it and a smaller light on the end

3601846 there were about six or seven then another four or five and then an odd one or two in three separate waves
3601847 they were definitely not aeroplanes they were a lot quicker and they were just so quiet i was completely gobsmacked
3601848 there was between five and 15 lights that went across the sky
3601849 they were different to planes because they made no noise i could not explain what it was
3601850 ive always thought theres something else out there but never seen anything like that before
3601851 they all moved at a constant speed height and direction they made no noise
3601852 we have reports from three police officers and paramedics from that area of birimingham who also witnessed strange lights and events
3601853 i saw a trail it was a silver thing but it went into a cloud and never came out i thought it was strange
3601854 it was following a plane which just went through the cloud but the object never came out it was like a long bubble i was watching for ages

3601881 nggak papa mbak kebetulan saya juga lagi free nih lagian kan kita dah lama nggak ngobrol ngobrol
3601882 aku dan mas bimo kenal sejak kuliah bahkan menjalani proses pacaran selama hampir 3 tahun sebelum memutuskan untuk menikah kami sama sama berasal dari keluarga yang biasa biasa saja dalam hal agama
3601883 bahkan boleh dibilang sangat longgar kami pun juga tidak termasuk mahasiswa yang agamis bahasa kerennya kami adalah mahasiswa gaul tapi cukup berprestasi walaupun demikian kami berusaha sebisa mungkin tidak meninggalkan sholat intinya ibadah ibadah yang wajib pasti kami jalankan ya mungkin sekedar gugur kewajiban saja mas bimo orang yang sabar pengertian bisa ngemong dan yang penting dia begitu mencintaiku proses pacaran yang kami jalani mulai tidak sehat banyak bisikan bisikan syetan yang mengarah ke perbuatan zina nggak ada pilihan lain aku dan mas bimo harus segera menikah karena dorongan syahwat itu begitu besar berdasar inilah akhirnya aku menerima ajakan mas bimo untuk menikah
3601884 itulah dhek mungkin aku ini hamba yang sombong untuk urusan besar seperti nikah ini aku sama sekali tidak melibatkan alloh jadi kalo emang akhirnya menjadi seperti ini itu semua memang akibat perbuatanku sendiri

3601899 no self disrespecting procrastinator is going to join any organization like this theyll put it in their things to do notepad theyll bookmark the website etc but not sign up so the website and structure is designed to benefit those wrongly accused of procrastination the act of joining proves they arent procrastinators
3601900 how to take no for an answer and still succeed
3601901 since im a consultant writer and strategist its not uncommon for me to sit back in my chair just thinking sometimes may look like a nap which it is not im really working how do you prove a negative well i found a way to prove it i only wish id had this then
3601902 no in fact unlike other anonymous programs we can cure them first this is not a 12 step program its a 1 step program i mean were talking about procrastinators
3601903 easy a procrastinator can read a free special report at com and suddenly realize that he or she is tired of being a procrastinator and decides to take action they can join then get a certificate of membership and then gets terminated from the membership the next day and voila theyre cured
3601904 then they can go back to their nap i mean their thinking
3601905 the very act of joining proves youre no procrastinator so and this is a good thing you are terminated which gives you a second piece of third party proof that you are no procrastinator that termination letter can hang right next to your membership certificate as evidence
3601906 as a clinical psychologist in private practice i worked with dozens of people suffering from procrastination
3601907 tom justins ability to whipsaw your intellect with humorous double turns and linguistic triple back flips catches you and keeps you safe in the palm pilot of his caring and kind support

3601910 making of da entrevista ao programa radarcultura da tv cultura em 14 02 2008
3601911 apakah selain agama allah islam yang mereka inginkan padahal hanya kepada allah lah berserah diri segala apa
3601912 pada hari ini telah aku sempurnakan untuk kalian agama kalian dan telah kusempurnakan nikmat ku bagi kalian dan aku ridha islam sebagai agama kalian
3601913 ini merupakan nikmat allah yang terbesar bagi ummat ini dimana allah telah menyempurnakan bagi mereka agama mereka sehingga mereka tidak butuh kepada selain agama islam dan tidak butuh kepada nabi selain nabi mereka shalawatullahi wasalaamu alaihi karena itulah allah menjadikan nabi ummat ini muhammad shallallahu alahi wasallam pent sebagai penutup para nabi dan allah mengutusnya untuk kalangan manusia dan jin maka tidak ada perkara yang haram kecuali apa yang dia haramkan dan tidak ada agama kecuali apa yang dia syariatkan segala sesuatu yang dia kabarkan adalah kebenaran dan kejujuran tidak ada kedustaan padanya dan tidak ada penyuluhan
3601914 pada hari ini telah aku sempurnakan untuk kalian agama kalian dan telah kusempurnakan nikmat ku bagi kalian dan aku ridha islam sebagai agama kalian
3601915 sesungguhnya aku tahu pada hari apa turun ayat tersebut ayat ini turun pada hari arafah bertepatan dengan hari jumat
3601916 sungguh nabi shallallahu alaihi wasallam berkhutbah di hadapan kami dengan suatu khutbah yang beliau tidak meninggalkan sedikitpun perkara yang akan berlangsung sampai hari kiamat kecuali beliau sebutkan ilmunya
3601917 rasullullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam shalat shubuh bersama kami selesai shalat beliau naik ke mimbar lalu berkhutbah di hadapan kami hingga tiba waktu dhuhur beliau turun dari mimbar dan shalat dhuhur kemudian beliau naik lagi ke mimbar lalu berkhutbah di hadapan kami hingga tiba waktu ashar kemudian beliau turun dari mimbar dan shalat ashar setelah shalat ashar beliau naik ke mimbar lalu mengkhutbahi kami hingga tenggelam matahari dalam khutbah tersebut beliau mengabarkan pada kami apa yang telah berlangsung dan apa yang akan berlangsung
3601918 sesungguhnya sebaik baik ucapan adalah ucapan allah dan sebaik baik ajaran adalah ajaran rasulullah dan sesungguhnya sejelek jelek perkara adalah sesuatu yang diada adakan dalam agama karena sesungguhnya sesuatu yang baru diada adakan dalam agama adalah bidah dan setiap bidah adalah kesesatan
3601919 rasulullah meninggalkan kami dalam keadaan tidak ada seekor burung pun yang mengepak ngepakkan kedua sayapnya di udara kecuali beliau menyebutkan ilmunya pada kami
3601920 tidaklah tertinggal sesuatu yang dapat mendekatkan ke surga dan menjauhkan dari neraka kecuali telah diterangkan pada kalian
3601921 pada hari ini telah aku sempurnakan bagi kalian agama kalian
3601922 dan janganlah dia menyekutukan rabb nya dengan seorang pun dalam peribadatan kepada nya
3601923 dialah yang menciptakan kematian dan kehidupan agar dia menguji kalian siapa yang paling baik di antara kalian amalannya
3601924 amalan yang paling baik adalah amalan yang paling ikhlas dan paling benar tetap karena amalan yang hanya disertai keikhlasan namun tidak benar maka amalan itu tidak diterima dan sebaliknya bila amalan itu benar namun tidak dibarengi keikhlasan juga tidak akan diterima
3601925 apa kedudukan kita dibanding nabi shallallahu alaihi wasallam beliau telah diampuni dosa dosanya yang telah lalu dan yang belakangan
3601926 aku akan menjauhi wanita maka aku tidak akan menikah selamanya
3601927 apakah kalian yang mengatakan begini dan begitu ketahuilah demi allah aku adalah orang yang paling takut kepada allah dibanding kalian dan paling bertakwa kepada nya akan tetapi aku puasa dan aku berbuka aku shalat dan aku tidur dan aku juga menikahi wanita siapa yang benci berpaling terhadap sunnahku maka ia bukan dari golonganku orang orang yang menjalankan sunnahku
3601928 sederhana dalam sunnah lebih baik daripada bersungguh sungguh dalam perbuatan bidah
3601929 siapa yang mengada adakan sesuatu amalan di dalam urusan agama kami ini dengan yang bukan bagian dari agama ini maka amalan itu tertolak
3601930 setiap bidah adalah sesat dan setiap kesesatan tempatnya di neraka
3601931 aku datang pada kalian dalam keadaan kalian memiliki dua hari raya yang kalian bersenang senang di dalamnya pada masa jahiliyyah dan sungguh allah telah menggantikan bagi kalian dua hari tersebut dengan yang lebih baik yaitu hari nahr iedul adha dan iedul fitri
3601932 siapa yang meniru niru suatu kaum maka ia termasuk golongan kaum tersebut
3601933 aku tinggalkan kepada kalian dua perkara yang kalau kalian berpegang teguh dengannya niscaya kalian tidak akan tersesat sepeninggalku selamanya yaitu kitabullah dan sunnahku
3601934 aku wasiatkan kepada kalian untuk takwa kepada allah azza wa jalla taat dan mendengar sekalipun kalian dipimpin oleh seorang hamba sahaya karena siapa saja diantara kalian yang hidup sepeninggalku niscaya dia akan melihat perselisihan yang banyak maka ketika itu wajib atas kalian berpegang teguh dengan sunnahku dan sunnah khulafaur rasyidin yang mendapat petunjuk setelahku gigitlah dengan gigi gerahammu dan hati hatilah kalian dari perkara perkara yang baru karena setiap yang bidah itu sesat

3601962 in a very short time this festival has become an integral part of summer in the finger lakes
3601963 this line up of world class performers is one of the important reasons that canandaigua is gaining a reputation as a center for the performaning and visual arts we look forward to the innovative music being presented at this years canandaigua lakemusic festival
3601964 we are very lucky to be holding this series in one of the best performance spaces in the area

3601976 sewaktu sd ada pelajaran menggambar bebas yang diajarkan oleh guru guru kita
3601977 coba kita ingat sewaktu pelajaran tersebut diberikan maka anak anak cenderung untuk menggambarkan sesuatu yang telah pernah berhasil mereka gambar jadi anak yang suka dengan bunga hanya menggambar bunga juga anak yang pernah dan suka menggambar mobil hanya menggambar mobil justru hal inilah memasung kebebasan itu
3601978 yang seharusnya adalah mereka diberikan sebuah kasus dan dibatasi dengan hal hal tertentu pencapaian tujuan itulah yang dibebaskan kepada mereka sehingga mereka menjadi kreatif dengan sebuah tujuan yang jelas
3601979 going to war with russia is bad for your creditworthiness to put it mildly
3601980 i dont think what has happened substantially changes the fundamentals for other countries but it may be a wake up call to some people who hadnt properly appreciated potential russian impact in the region
3601981 youd expect this to affect sentiment towards them as it is more evidence of russia trying to exert control over its nearest neighbors
3601982 a more aggressive russian foreign policy within the former soviet union is likely to pose a threat to ukrainian asset prices in due course
3601983 obviously people will also be looking at the former soviet republics with borders with russia
3601984 the big difference is that you do not have any particular disputed border regions except for a very small area of estonia or areas with a large russian population
3601985 a worsening in relations between russia and the west would put at risk russian supplies of gas to european countries

3601994 mr suskind reports that the bush administration in its pursuit of war created and promoted forged documents about iraq
3601995 i am particularly troubled that the decision to disseminate this fabricated intelligence is alleged to have come from the highest reaches of the administration the administrations attempt to challenge mr suskinds reporting appears to have been effectively dismissed by the publication of the authors interview recordings and transcripts i have instructed my staff to conduct a careful review of mr suskinds allegations and the role played by senior administration officials in this matter

3601999 the stunning images arent enough for herzog though he wants us to see how these quirky researchers in their lust to explore are acting out a drive as primitive as nature the need to break away from the world in order to find it
3602000 werner herzog is a stranger in a strange land as soon as he gets out of bed in the morning in this travelogue of antarctica his perverse curiosity and zest for the harshest extremes of nature transform what might have been a standard tv special into an idiosyncratic expression of wonder
3602001 like many of mr herzogs movies fiction and nonfiction encounters at the end of the world itself has the quality of a dream its at once vivid and vague easy to grasp and somehow beyond reach
3602002 even when freshly washed and relieved of all obvious confections children tend to be sticky

3602009 i asked him what was wrong and he said he couldnt help it he just missed his mommy today
3602010 but the light was green i didn t hear a siren you didn t have your lights on
3602011 i was watching the lights and the intersection no one was stopped those two other cars almost hit you too
3602012 im gonna have to charge with you failure to stop
3602013 im a very careful driver you didn t have your siren or your lights on someone less careful would have hit you
3602014 so you can plead guilty and well accept an 80 fine and no points does that work
3602015 i did stop i know you think im just some stupid woman driver but im not i have spent years studying how to maneuver a few tons of metal around
3602016 i cant plead guilty to something i didn t do
3602017 you know you could be a formula one driver you still almost hit me
3602018 you looked at me like i was some kind of clich silly woman driver but if i didn t have the training i have i would have hit you you know those other cars almost hit you too
3602019 how come they never heard your siren or saw your lights
3602020 i dont want to sway you but you stand a real good chance of getting convicted
3602021 have you ever been freaked out when a casual acquaintance from real life found your blog or when your sitemeter showed a steady stream of google pervs visiting your site do you wonder about whether to put up photos of your children or your friends on your blog for fear of your privacy many of us have experienced these unsettling moments and questioned or even changed our writing styles and our habits as a result what strategies do you use to reach the audience you want while maintaining your own privacy most bloggers use some kind of anonymization or privacy strategy a screen name being the most simple and obvious
3602022 if im not back by 1 30 p m or so just take graham in my car to the concert and ill take your car and meet you there
3602023 i should be back but if not ill just be 10 or 15 minutes behind you
3602024 a good pilot doesn t try and take on mother nature today was a good experience for you
3602025 every job ive interviewed for there have been at least 100 applicants
3602026 i have lots of skills and im finding it tough to get a job
3602027 and id rather work there than a hardware store i like their clothes and you get a discount and the benefits are appealing
3602028 if i can get in with a national company i can move with them i cant afford to live here if i do want to retire
3602029 the previous team failed to communicate the benefits of the project

3602036 we believe that the 47 1 percent that we have requested is needed if we are going to be able to stand behind our promises and to provide a market for homeowners insurance in florida
3602037 from the average persons perspective they would say that state farm mutual is doing well in the non hurricane years
3602038 its reasonable for state farm mutual to earn a profit
3602039 they are assuming a great deal of risk and they should be compensated for that risk
3602040 nobody can say where the greater frequency of hurricanes is going to go
3602041 it is extremely unlikely that the 2004 and 2005 storm sequence will reoccur
3602042 and state farms recent experience should not be cited as a reason for raising rates
3602043 you have to realize that were all part of a dying breed once it has reached its maximum

3602051 usa v australia scores still nil all after one innings each nailbiting stuff
3602052 same music same routines its usa v china still is this groundhog day nbc style
3602053 i was wondering what you and the rest of the world thought about the fact that the major events have been rescheduled to be shown live in primetime 8pm on the east coast of the us living in the east coast i love the east coast bias
3602054 morning george whats happened to robin did the guardian give him the boot after yesterdays badminton fiasco
3602055 from a brit in australias perspective its completely buggered up my schedule as all the finals are during the working day and the heats are on when i get in from work
3602056 i think i have a loaf of bread in my bread bin older than the smallest chinese girl
3602057 here on the west coast of the united states nbc has made the decision not to show the swimming finals live even though the current time is after 7pm everybodys home from work and turning on their televisions like true patriots only to find that inside edition a magazine show takes precedence over this landmark event ill have to tune back in in a few hours to see if by the magic of tape delay he actually only takes the bronze

3602060 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3602061 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3602062 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3602063 klassekvotienterne er steget helt vildt og det er t af de aller st rste problemer vi st r over for i gymnasierne det er roden til frafald og til at eleverne ikke f ler at de kan f lge med i undervisningen
3602064 de fleste lokaler er bygget til klasser med 24 elever s der sidder over ti elever mere i klasselokalerne der er rigtig mange elever som sidder i vindueskarmene og der er slet ikke b ger nok til alle
3602065 jeg tror de tal er vildt overdrevet hvis elevernes stamhold er s store som vi h rer her s har de sikkert nogle valghold der er meget sm det afg rende er gennemsnittet og det ligger slet ikke p de fantasital som vi f r at h re her
3602066 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3602067 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3602068 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3602069 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3602070 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3602071 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3602072 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3602073 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3602074 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3602075 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3602076 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3602077 were still looking very aggressively at a connection between murphy and someone else
3602078 investigators want to learn a lot more about what mr murphy was doing in september 2006
3602079 it just multiplies the potential for you to be able to solve any crime
3602080 we havent even seen the reports we have to review the case and review his criminal history before we make that decision
3602081 we dont want taxpayers footing the bill for people who are violating the code
3602082 what have they been doing dont they already charge fines
3602083 this is just a difficult time to start penalizing people
3602084 people are having a rough enough time out here without having to be aggravated by the city
3602085 about the rocket firing i think those who are responsible are those who collaborate with israel because there is a consensus by all palestinian groups to respect the truce
3602086 following a course that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by stalin and hitler in the 1930s
3602087 to respect the life and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are
3602088 there is a reinforcement on the other side and its not by chance that we are training intensively on the golan heights and on a major scale
3602089 i say for a thousandth time that we are a friend of all people in the world even israelis and americans
3602090 we are against the israeli regime we have no war with jews
3602091 thanks to god and to hugo chavez i have a house
3602092 i spent my allowance on two humphrey buttons and pinned them to the curtain in my bedroom when i got home
3602093 i saw a william mckinley button president from 1897 to 1901 for 50 cents and i managed to talk the guy down to 25 cents when i went home and consulted my book on political buttons value i discovered it was worth a whole dollar
3602094 three years ago i advertised for the truman button in the independence missouri newspaper
3602095 thats where truman began his career i got no response then just two weeks ago i got a call a woman who owned the button had died and her children had found my ad clipping in the drawer where she had left it
3602096 why did i go out and get that credit card when i was 19
3602097 and why did i take out that school loan for more than i actually needed ive defaulted so many times
3602098 we are a five piece made up from bassist keyboard guitar and two drummers it is the two drummers that give cosmic inferno a big funky sound one drummer is pika pikachu from afririmpo she is incredible and is able to tour for the first time
3602099 our sound is more funky 70s disco sound also we find rhythm and keep playing for 1 2 3 hours improvised guitar heavy and fast it is dancing music
3602100 anything you can tell me in regards to the future for amt
3602101 no future it just happens what happens i dont know just keep on going
3602102 i hate to see it happen were going to miss it this is an institution
3602103 its served us well for many years i like the convenience and the variety and i cant believe it wont be here anymore
3602104 we never really looked at money we looked at it like if we took care of customers the money would come
3602105 its getting harder and harder to do a good job
3602106 certain segments continue to grow fabric stationery candy back to school items but not enough to support the size of the store
3602107 theyre one of the anchors and we already have too many holes in the market
3602108 itll be a huge letdown some of the things they carry you cant find anywhere else
3602109 i think its sad in the name of progress other businesses have come into town that have crowded them out and diminished their share of the market to the extent that they cant operate anymore
3602110 the drakes have provided a great convenience with helpful staff and now that the towns grown up its like their services arent needed anymore
3602111 i never got up in the morning and said aw jeez
3602112 i wish i had asked for my day in court rather than accept a police caution that way i could have explained that i was trying to do what was right for my daughter
3602113 jess isnt bad but some of the 13 year olds who live here do use drugs and drink and i dont want that path for her
3602114 she didnt appreciate the seriousness of it and if i had simply grounded her it wouldnt have proved the point
3602115 i was in control of my actions and had no intention of causing her physical pain i felt that she needed something to shock her
3602116 i did deserve the slapping because of the things id been doing i was expecting my dad to come home from the police station and for everything to be the same as before
3602117 we have lost an experienced youth worker and men like him are worth their weight in gold there is clearly a need for better legislation
3602118 on monday june 30 a 13 year old girl was slapped in the face at a house in wythenshawe
3602119 there has been no decline in actual opening hours but the definition of the target has narrowed and become more restrictive
3602120 in the light of this we will have to revise our approach but the bottom line is we have already significantly improved access to primary care and will improve it even further in the future
3602121 we have pilot schemes under way such as doctors in store at sainsburys and an at home extended hours service through the bury and rochdale doctors on call co operative these pilots no longer meet the government targets for extended hours as patients are not seen at a gp practice
3602122 and for the second time this year andre ethier gets the walk off base hit against a tough lefthander
3602123 were gonna look at those contracts and make sure we cut costs
3602124 im appalled that this council would consider such a thing
3602125 i tell you what its because hes the honest one
3602126 dreamfish helps change makers to connect in order to collaboratively create a sustainable future
3602127 i am appealing to this man to come forward as he could hold information vital to the inquiry
3602128 ally works with the humblest of materials to create pieces on a monumental scale
3602129 i think manchesters success has been down to the attitude
3602130 since the 1960s with the hollies every generation has influenced the next and produced band after band writing hit after hit
3602131 tony wilson helped bring credibility to it and people began to be proud to be from manchester
3602132 its happening again with some brilliant young bands playing all types of music
3602133 i predict there will be even more big names coming out of the city soon
3602134 of the 50 people attending the church only six are in full time employment so the effort by local people to raise 150 000 of the money has been tremendous
3602135 the vision was for the new building to be a place for the whole community to use
3602136 we are delighted virgin has made this generous gesture and are anxious to get the job done quickly
3602137 it was very tough i was pleased to break the record but it meant more to raise money
3602138 winning was the icing on the cake and breaking the record the sprinkles on top
3602139 it was horrible the first time to go through mrsa but when he got meningitis it was even worse
3602140 within minutes there were nurses and doctors all trying to save him they were amazing
3602141 hes our little miracle hes a fighter and he has come through so much we really want to thank the staff who helped him
3602142 i was a year short on my pension payments and they offered to make this up
3602143 but only if i was to renounce all grievances against them and not to complain about them any more i obviously turned them down
3602144 this was to prevent me creating trouble or publicising what i felt was wrong with the university
3602145 the appeal hearing was incredibly brief as if they had made up their minds already
3602146 there has been a general disinvestment in humanities which has affected not just me but others as well i think it is very short sighted of manchester it is because of financial mismanagement that they are having to freeze posts
3602147 this offer is still available and made without prejudice and should you accept will represent a full and final settlement of any outstanding issues or grievances you may have with the university
3602148 july 31 marked prof terry eagletons normal contractual retirement date at 65 and he is no longer employed at the university
3602149 i called the police but they took two hours to get there
3602150 they need to do something so these men can be caught
3602151 i am still very shocked and shaken about what happened it was very frightening they punched me in the face and stole the keys
3602152 i am just glad there were witnesses there or they could have killed me
3602153 its going to cost me 1 500 to repair the damage

3602157 placebos can affect patients response to pain therapy and also influence the results of clinical trials we have shown that responses to experimental placebos alter how the brain responds to pain and also that responses to experimental placebos persist in repeated testing in healthy volunteers
3602158 this allows us to measure how the brains pain control system is activated under different conditions we hope this study will help us understand how the brain deals with pain it is also likely to lead to development of new painkilling therapies and better ways of testing them

3602187 its not that simple and you know it i cant just throw away all the morals that the village and father instilled into me
3602188 youre an idiot you can easily throw it away the thing that binds you to the past is so visable even in this dark night if you give the fire your

3602226 israels partisans have worked hard to present the country as a tiny david facing a goliath arab military machine in fact however virtually all experts including the u s department of defence believe the israel defense forces have always been more than a match for their arab neighbors
3602227 the zionist emergency council and local zionist groups provided the basic financial support for this christian front which soon through local chapters and a budget of 150 000 was
3602228 political stereotypes israelis jews modern western having democratic orientations good fighters underdog israel as david facing an inept goliath trusted ally and a true friend of the united states a threatened party seeking and deserving peace and security in the midst of implacable enemies etc
3602229 in the official zionist rendition of the 1948 war the events are presented as a battle between a jewish david and an arabic goliath central to key narratives in israeli culture is the myth which depicts the israel palestine conflict as a war of the few against the many since the early twentieth century zionist historiography has based this narrative of the few against the many on the biblical account of joshuas conquest of ancient palestine while mainstream israeli historians continue to portray the 1948 war as an unequal struggle between a jewish david and an arab goliath and as a desperate heroic and ultimately successful jewish struggle against overwhelming odds
3602230 the story of david and goliath provided a reassuring myth of survival not only because it told of the victory of the weak against the strong but also because the youthful victor of the battle against goliath eventually emerged as the great ruler of ancient israel king david by identifying with david the jews of both the pre state and state periods could allow themselves to believe that they too would eventually achieve a high degree of political sovereignty analogous to that of david in ancient times
3602231 the international phase of the 1948 war has been filtered through the david and goliath iconography with regard to the size of opposing forces and belief that israel was on the defensive the war taken to be an unalloyed military necessity rather than an outgrowth of expansionist goals concerning the relative size of military forces ben gurion claimed that 700 000 jews are pitted against 27 million arabs one against forty
3602232 this will be a war of extermination and a momentous massacre that will be spoken of like the mongol invasions and the crusades
3602233 arab intransigence on one side a few million israelis on the other side twenty arab countries with a population of 100 million through ingenuity resourcefulness and courage the beleaguered jewish settlement in palestine was able to forestall the attack of five arab armies david versus goliath
3602234 the issue of jewish survival is again at stake you cant have judaism without jews the war assumes a metaphysical importance beyond the importance of individual jewish lives
3602235 were scared as a people how many times can david beat goliath
3602236 the relative sizes of arab and jewish populations have always been a serious concern first to the early zionists who sought in vain through jewish immigration to build up a jewish majority in palestine and later to israel which has sought a larger population base to meet the threat implicit in the disproportionately goliath like arab populations that surround it but since 1967 the greatly disproportionate sizes of israeli and arab populations are only one part of the population problem the new factor is the higher growth rate of the arab population within israel itself for deriving from the conquests from the six day war the proportion of palestinian arabs to jews within israels new boundaries rose to a level that if their higher growth rate continues palestinian arabs will outnumber jews in israel itself within a few decades all other factors remaining constant
3602237 to the arabs and the supporters of their cause israel is the goliath gigantic with american arms and money
3602238 in washington ronald reagan by instinct a warm supporter of israel reflected that in the public perception israel had been transformed from the

3602259 were too dependent on foreign oil and we need to be exploring more at home
3602260 it is much cheaper and much less deadly to conserve energy and increase efficiency than to send troops to protect oil interests in the middle east while our soldiers in iraq are fighting for many reasons we cannot divorce what is happening in the middle east from our dependence on oil

3602275 problemas pol ticos impediram um acordo naquele momento sobre aquele tema a minha impresss o era de que se tivesse mais quatro ou cinco dias em genebra resolver amos este problema
3602276 tem a sensa o de que ainda h uma pequena chance de concluir essas negocia es
3602277 se retomarmos as negocia es rapidamente provavelmente continuaremos de onde paramos mas se a retomada ocorrer em dois ou tr s anos eu temo que os reflexos de novos c lculos e protecionismo ter o tempo de colocar em quest o todos os acordos aos quais chegamos

3602310 market conditions have become more challenging particularly in the us
3602311 however the long term trends for the travel industry remain positive and our broad portfolio of brands and fee based business model position us well to take full advantage of this
3602312 each day we are opening one new hotel and signing up two into our pipeline

3602317 the success has come as a surprise to us both
3602318 the price of oil has fallen significantly over the past few weeks and the cost of petrol has also been lowered however that does not mean inflation has peaked
3602319 gas and electricity bills are set to increase and producers are still facing high input costs which could be passed on to retailers and in turn on to consumers we expect inflation to remain above the two per cent target well into next year and until inflation does peak the bank of england will be unable to cut interest rates despite the rapid economic slowdown currently in train
3602320 the rise in the consumer prices index cpi from 3 8 per cent to 4 4 per cent the highest monthly rise since january 1997 is significantly above the target rate of inflation the cpi could also increase further given trends in food prices and recent announcements in respect of energy bills
3602321 the concern is reinforced by the rise in the retail prices index rpi from 4 6 per cent to five per cent as the rpi is often used as a basis for pay negotiations
3602322 however there are some signs that inflation will shortly peak and this will give room for interest rate cuts later in the year or early in 2009
3602323 the present economic climate means that many people in the uk are likely to be feeling the pinch as they deal with rising food prices utility bills and fuel costs
3602324 decades of research into the habits and expectations of direct mail donors have given us considerable insight into whats likely to work in the mail and what isnt even so our best guesses are wrong far too often research into the minds of online donors is by comparison in its infancy at this writing the web is celebrating its 15th anniversary and fundraising online on any meaningful scale dates only to the late 1990s bluntly put theres a whole lot more that we dont know than that we do know about raising money online
3602325 i visited santa barbara in the summer of 1969 to speak at a water conference and then flew north to berkeley to speak at a conservation conference on the plane i read an article about the use of campus anti war teach ins to educate students about the vietnam war suddenly the idea occurred to me why not devote a day to a nationwide teach in on the environment thus was born earth day eight months later on april 22 1970 20 million people 2 000 colleges and universities 10 000 grammar and high schools and 1 000 communities mobilized for the first nationwide demonstrations on environmental problems congress adjourned for the day so members could attend earth day events in their districts the response was nothing short of remarkable and the modern american environmental movement took off my major objective in planning earth day 1970 was to organize a nationwide public demonstration so large it would finally get the attention of the politicians and force the environmental issue into the political dialogue of the nation it worked by the sheer force of its collective action on that one day the american public forever changed the political landscape respecting environmental issues

3602337 il cambiamento del modo di lavorare allinterno delle organizzazioni nonch la necessit di una maggiore valorizzazione delle risorse umane derivano oltre che da cause esterne inerenti ai fattori ambientali e competitivi anche da fattori e forze interni alle imprese stesse vero che per alcuni decenni la scienza organizzativa ha riconosciuto la supremazia della struttura sulluomo tuttavia questo pi che da convinzioni ideologiche dipeso dalla situazione ambientale che le imprese dovevano affrontare una situazione ambientale relativamente stabile caratterizzata da un mercato che richiedeva soprattutto efficienza produttiva e prevedibilit organizzativa nel momento in cui simili condizioni sono venute meno anche la supremazia della struttura sulla variabile umana ha perso una sua ragione dessere e oggi le convinzioni di taylor appaiono del tutto inadeguate
3602338 many factors are contributing to this we are now trying to manage that as for the olympic green yesterday they saw not many people inside
3602339 its the season for traveling and last year the hotel was full the olympics should have brought business to beijing but the reality is too far from the expectation
3602340 sought to soothe this obsession by engaging in frantic activities such as gardening and debauchery

3602342 shannon tuley is out of the coma and continues to make progress for recovery
3602343 these are people that spent their whole lives in this community they have raised their families here
3602344 they have paid taxes here all these years and now something like this needs to be taken away when they need it and thats just a very hard thing to do for anyone in this business
3602345 no one likes doing it no one likes making these kinds of decisions but thats where we are
3602346 frankly it just further exacerbates the problem because then they begin having health issues and it just begins this cycle transportation is the same way
3602347 you dig a hole and pile up the dirt around the outside of the hole until youre deep enough and wide enough that you have protection from bullets
3602348 the dads are supposed to pick some dirt up and then begin to build it in
3602349 i came to see my grandmother and build this mud fort
3602350 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3602351 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3602352 for years fema resisted acknowledging the problem or seeking funds for remediation
3602353 we are committed to upholding our obligations to remediate remove or upgrade them as necessary
3602354 we believe in adhering to any relevant environmental rule or law and will do so
3602355 we made ayp in the district and all three buildings
3602356 thats good news for us our faculty and our building principals worked hard to help each and every student to achieve all they could achieve
3602357 we wont spend in aircraft or tanks we wont increase our military spending
3602358 i dont think so because i dont see that countries are competing to see who buys more weapons
3602359 some are buying a lot of weapons others are replacing what they had but i dont think you can talk about an arms race
3602360 like everything else defense equipment wears out clearly there is some modernization going on even in venezuela
3602361 but in venezuelas case when these purchases signal an intent to project power or intimidate those kind of actions may cause others to sense danger and inspire them to spend more to protect themselves
3602362 are signs of an arms race in the sense of an action reaction pattern nonetheless there have been big increases in military spending in some countries in the region
3602363 it isnt the crime but the cover up that gets you
3602364 how would you feel if your husband cheated on you
3602365 ive been cheated by you since i dont know when
3602366 we can only say the evidence available to us right now which is considered inadequate suggests that there is some type of appetite suppressing mechanism in some of the naturally occurring chemicals in hoodia
3602367 a chemical within that class of molecules has real potential to reduce appetite
3602368 im less confident regarding the hoodia molecule itself for reasons relating to its metabolism absorption and breakdown in humans
3602369 hoodia gordonii works within the satiety center of the brain by releasing a chemical compound similar to glucose but up to 100 times stronger
3602370 the hypothalamus receives this signal as an indication that enough food has been consumed and this in turn decreases the appetite
3602371 no conclusive evidence to support the claim of appetite suppression
3602372 there is no published scientific data to support its use but similarly there is no data suggesting adverse effects its kind of uncharted territory
3602373 some of my patients have tried it but i havent had any who felt like it was helpful to them
3602374 there appears to be much more hoodia offered in north american markets than the production ability of the south african markets
3602375 buy at a reputable store and buy a reputable brand

3602385 mrs tolbert saw the cia agent that assassinated her husband she was on the scene she told me several times that it was not doe who killed her husband
3602386 president doe prevented me from seeing the map when general quoiwonkpa attempted giving it to me at the mansion

3602397 on the anniversary of the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima on august 6 1945 john pilger describes the progression of lies from the dust of that detonated city to the wars of today and the threatened attack on iran
3602398 i was thrown on the ground and noticed only the stalks of my flowers were left everything was still and quiet and when i got up there were people naked not saying anything some of them had no skin or hair i was certain i was dead
3602399 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
3602400 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
3602401 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
3602402 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
3602403 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence
3602404 security in afghanistan has deteriorated and our enemies are on the offensive
3602405 the taliban are now mounting a hit and run war against their enemies
3602406 it doesnt need much money or weapons compared to what the foreign troops are spending
3602407 the goal of terrorism is to terrify and to intimidate
3602408 it is not to take and hold territory it is not to dominate institutions it is not to win the allegiance of the populace it is to terrify and the tactics of the taliban are more terroristic even than at the end of the last fighting season
3602409 the increasing use of very public attacks has had a striking effect on morale far beyond the immediate victims
3602410 now they are on the brink of humiliation thats the aim of our fight
3602411 seems to be actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently painting it in a negative light

3602415 ahmed musa a young boy was killed by a bullet of the occupying forces in nilin
3602416 ya ahmed please give my regards and my love to abir
3602417 my greatest fear is the loss of humanity among israeli troops because of the ongoing warfare
3602418 the good thing about the heightened awareness now is that at least some of these soldiers names are getting out there
3602419 if anything good is coming out of that media attention its that people see that they are truly human its not just numbers its actually brothers and sons and fathers theyre human
3602420 unless this reality is understood and action is taken promptly the future of afghanistan is bleak
3602421 its like people forget about us being in afghanistan larry would tell me that all the time
3602422 you always hear about iraq but you never hear about afghanistan
3602423 theres a real war going on people are dying all the time in afghanistan
3602424 he loved the farm and he loved the cows and hed come home from leave and go out in the barn and take a deep breath and say oh that smells good
3602425 we were thankful that he died at the hands of his own men that he loved and not at the hands of those who hated him and hated all americans
3602426 if someone out of hate killed him its kind of a double grief but it wasnt someone out of hate it was someone who loved him someone who cared about him
3602427 he kind of led me to believe that it was more cushy than it was
3602428 we were just fortunate that we were able to have an open casket
3602429 it brought some kind of closure because we didnt have to wonder whether he was really in there other families arent so lucky
3602430 the areas we moved into had not had a large constant u s presence
3602431 they would be in the bushes in trees on roofs
3602432 i would get phone calls cindy dont panic or anything but jeffrey is on the roof again he had no fear
3602433 he told me mom theyre rebounding that was the word he used i believe
3602434 he said its going to get worse before it gets better so i knew things werent as tame as it was put out to be
3602435 there werent i e d s when jeff was there the first time
3602436 and now theyre getting all the things that iraq has and theyre bringing in those heinous ways of killing as i gather this i e d was ridiculously large its the easiest and most cowardly way of doing things
3602437 as a father it angers me some it angered me when he was there especially since iraq gets all the attention iraq gets all the money
3602438 it is my sense that it is a pivotal time in this thing
3602439 i think its a valid war but because it doesnt get the attention it doesnt get all it needs consequently i think the guerrilla war will be going for a long time
3602440 afghanistan is not lost but the signs are not good
3602441 as a reinvigorated insurgency threatens the gains that have been made and western capitals pressured by publics unwilling to accept military casualties begin to explore endgames and exit strategies the risk of losing afghanistan is very real
3602442 i think it isnt true and he will call in the middle of the night like he used to
3602443 we would sleep lightly to listen for that blessed phone call
3602444 fear no man of any size call on me and ill equalize
3602445 o king live forever 10 you have issued a decree o king that everyone who hears the sound of the horn flute zither lyre harp pipes and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold 11 and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace 12 but there are some jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of babylon shadrach meshach and abednego who pay no attention to you o king they neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up
3602446 is it true shadrach meshach and abednego that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold i have set up 15 now when you hear the sound of the horn flute zither lyre harp pipes and all kinds of music if you are ready to fall down and worship the image i made very good but if you do not worship it you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand
3602447 o nebuchadnezzar we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter 17 if we are thrown into the blazing furnace the god we serve is able to save us from it and he will rescue us from your hand o king 18 but even if he does not we want you to know o king that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up
3602448 i see four men unbound walking in the middle of the fire and they are not hurt and the fourth has the appearance of a god
3602449 two are better than one because they have a good reward for their toil for if they fall one will lift up the other but woe to the one who is alone and falls and does not have another to help
3602450 if you are the son of god tell these stones to become bread
3602451 it is written man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of god
3602452 it is also written do not put the lord your god to the test
3602453 i have hidden your word in my heart that i might not sin against you
3602454 one does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of god
3602455 what does this scripture mean in this area of my life is this what it is calling me to do
3602456 the word of god is living and active sharper than any two edged sword piercing until it divides soul from spirit joints from marrow it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart
3602457 worked at night on a tower in the neighbourhood of abu ghraib

3602511 a lot of the other firms that have a large number of investment advisers are just really struggling and not in a position to be bidding against ameriprise for this business

3602524 as one experienced prosecutor in our office said swans dont swim in sewers sometimes you need to use one of the inhabitants of the sewers in connection with an investigation
3602525 the defendant will claim entrapment and do everything possible to make the prosecutors regret who they got in bed with
3602526 a person who was allegedly providing information to law enforcement regarding t t s narcotics distribution activities
3602527 the officer roberts told the party trump that he knew one of the individuals that had robbed him and the officer said he would talk to him
3602528 the party appeared to be extremely relieved that the officer knew one of the robbers and was going to talk to him when the party left he moved to shake the officers hand and actually put five 20 bills in the officers hand this money was later property inventoried
3602529 he was a nice guy he was a good neighbor
3602530 i talked to him one day and asked him what he did and he said he was retired and i said what
3602531 i remember thinking i wish i could retire that young he just never went to work he was always home

3602558 here i am at thy service here i am o lord here i am to declare that there is no partner with thee all praise and blessings belong to thee and all sovereignty is thine i am here at thy service and thou hast no partner o allah
3602559 there is no god but allah he has no partner all sovereignty and praise belong to him he gives life and brings death he is all powerful and supreme over everything
3602560 all praise is due to allah so we praise him and seek his pardon and we turn to him we seek refuge with allah from the evils of ourselves and from the evil consequences of our deeds whom allah guides aright there is none to lead him astray and there is none to guide him aright whom allah leads astray i bear witness that there is no god but allah the one having no partner with him his is the sovereignty and to him is due all praise he grants life and causes death and is powerful over everything there is no god but allah the one he fulfilled his promise and granted victory to his bondsman and he alone routed the confederates of the enemies of islam o people listen to my words for i do not know whether we shall ever meet again and perform hajj after this year o ye people allah says o people we created you from one male and one female and made you into tribes and nations so as to be known to one another verily in the sight of allah the most honoured amongst you is the one who is most god fearing there is no superiority for an arab over a non arab and for a non arab over an arab nor for the white over the black nor for the black over the white except in god conciousness all mankind is the progeny of adam and adam was fashioned out of clay behold every claim of privilage whether that of blood or property is under my heels except that of the custody of the kabah and supplying of water to the pilgrims o people of quraish dont appear on the day of judgement with the burden of this world around your necks whereas other people may appear before the lord with the rewards of the hereafter in that case i shall avail you naught against allah behold all practice of the days of ignorance are now under my feet the blood revenges of the days of ignorance are remitted the first claim on blood i abolish is that of ibn rabiah bin harith who was nursed in the tribe of saad and whom the hudhayls killed all interest and usurious dues accruing from the times of ignorance stand wiped out and the first amount of interest that i remit is that which abbas ibn abd al muttalib had to receive verily it is remitted entirely o people verily yor blood your property and your honour are sacred and inviolable until you appear before your lord as the sacred inviolability of this day of yours this month of yours and this very town of yours verily you will soon meet your lord and you will be held answerable for your actions o people verily you have got certain rights over your women and your women have certain rights over you it is your right upon them to honour their conjugal rights and not to commit acts of impropriety which if they do you are authorised by allah to separate them from your beds amd chastise them but not severely and if they refrain then clothe and feed them properly behold it is not permissible for a woman to give anything from the wealth of her husband to anyone but with his consent treat the women kindly since they are your helpers and not in a position to manage their affairs themselves fear allah concerning women for verily you have taken them on the security of allah and have made their persons lawful unto you by words of allah o people allah the mighty and exalted has ordained to every one his due share of inheritance hence there is no need of special testament for an heir departing from the rules laid down by the shariah the child belongs to the marriage bed and the violator of wedlock shall be stoned and reckoning of their deeds rests with allah he who attributes his ancestry to other than his father or claims his clientship to other than his master the curse of allah is upon him all depts must be repaid all borrowed property must be returned gifts should be reciprocated and a surety must make good the loss to the assured beware no one committing a crime is responsible for it but himself neither the child is responsible for the crime of his father nor the father is responsible for the crime of his child nothing of his brother is lawful for a muslim except what he himself gives willingly so do not wrong yourselves o people every muslim is the brother of every other muslim and all the muslims form one brotherhood and your slaves see that you feed them with such food as you eat yourselves and clothe them with the clothes that you yourselves wear take heed not to go astray after me and strike one anothers necks he who amongst you has any trust with him he must return it to its owner o people listen and obey though a mangled abyssinian slave is appointed your amir provided he executes the ordinance of the book of allah among you o people no prophet would be raised after me and no new ummah would be formed after you verily i have left amongst you that which will never lead you astray the book of allah which if you hold fast you shall never go astray and beware of transgressing the limits set in the matters of religion for it is transgression of the proper bounds of religion that brought destruction to many people before you verily the shetan is disappointed at ever being worshipped in this land of yours but he will be pleased by obedience in anything short of worship that is in matters you may be disposed to think insignificant so beware of him in your matters of religion behold worship your lord offer prayers five times a day observe fast in the month of ramadhaan pay readily the zakat poor due on your property and perform pilgrimage to the house of god and obey your rulers and you will be admitted to the paradise of your lord let him that is present convey it unto him who is absent for many people to whom the message is conveyed may be more mindful of it than the audience and if you were asked about me what would you say
3602561 we bear witness that you have conveyed the trust of religion and discharged your ministry of prophethood and looked to our welfare

3602579 this street is very small tanks cant go through here
3602580 dont worry every day youll know what happens to me i have a blog whats it called
3602581 we know that families in some communities still use the corner shop on a daily basis for their food and other household goods
3602582 it is therefore essential we take healthy eating options to these stores and reach those families who are at the greatest risk of poor health due to a poor diet
3602583 working together we can bring not only the access but also the messages about healthy choices to the consumers that need it most
3602584 we fully support the drive to encourage healthy eating through improving access to fruit and veg
3602585 but just providing healthy food options isnt enough to change the way people eat to be successful this initiative needs to be joined up with other local programmes which can educate and empower people to make healthy choices
3602586 obesity is a complex problem it will take long term sustained investment to change the habits of the next generation

3602593 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3602594 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3602595 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3602596 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3602597 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3602600 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3602601 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3602602 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3602603 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3602604 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3602605 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3602606 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3602607 in all truthfulness what really matters is whether more students are becoming ready for college and career
3602608 thats why we think its time to change the focus of our dialogue and we ought to be focused on are we making significant inroads in preparing more students to become ready for college course work
3602609 at the same time we need to see it as an opportunity to make changes in the system and how we serve those students
3602610 we know we still need to work on that achievement gap

3602745 obad undertook the survey with visitors to the exhibition as a way for people to express their thoughts feelings and sentiments about the brand of abu dhabi which was launched in november 2007

3602767 gcc countries are considered among the most important tourist exporting countries to sharjah with over quarter million gcc tourists visited the emirate last year these figures prove vital importance of these tourism markets and justify the tremendous efforts exerted by the sctda on these markets and the host of tourist promotions and products offered by the authority for the gcc tourists

3602788 no one is the same you cant compare yourself to other people because everyone is different
3602789 actual plot details and dialogue are rendered completely secondary to maintaining overall tone
3602790 its possible and even advisable to appreciate the enrapturing visuals of a resplendently red undulating armada floating its way down inky canals without scrabbling desperately to find meaning
3602791 an unexplainable murder in the midst of a mysterious migration of jellyfish into japanese waters
3602792 hauntingly enigmatic poetic and understated portrait of rootlessness apathy and disconnection
3602793 dreamlike temporal and existential ambiguity within a realistic verite styled camerawork the film was shot exclusively in digital video through alternating point of views narrative ellipses and surreal encounters
3602794 visual incongruence that innately reflect s the adrift young protagonists dissociation from their oppressively mundane and self induced reality
3602795 as the red jellyfish navigates through its new and unfamiliar environment its plight reflects the uncertain and treacherous path of the films young antiheroes foundering in the impersonality of technology instinctually searching not for transitory escape but for a way home
3602796 from various angles with results that range from the blackly comic jun ichikawas tadon to chikuwa to the brutally grotesque takashi miikes ichi the killer
3602797 sets his inquiry in a world several degrees removed from ours
3602798 do i exist the unbearable blankness of being in kiyoshi kurosawas bright future
3602799 a truly remarkable subject beautiful graceful amorphous alive but distinctly remote and unreachable
3602800 too self sufficient and formless to be assigned a single significance the jellyfish nevertheless reflects or absorbs both of the central characters as well as embodying the relationship between them
3602801 lost aimless alienated young men and women usually hostile or at least indifferent to the adult world
3602802 sense of self definition or engagement with the world a feeling of existential out of placeness
3602803 thats just its nature im sure you two will get along fine
3602804 his amazing self sacrifice and utter selflessness in accepting the role of kichizo in realm of the senses 1976 and thereby earning the status of the first actor in japanese film to receive actual shall we say oral bliss on film
3602805 maybe i should just put the bright future on hold until im ready to not understand what it means
3602806 its clear the director intended to make a movie thats hard to get a grip on but i have to wonder if the audience will get anything at all or if theyll only feel a little sting as it slips through their fingers
3602807 kurosawa himself has said that the sarcasm tinted katakana of the title akarui mirai is in fact not sarcastic at all he really is trying to show us a bright future albeit bright from the point of view of the younger generation not the adults
3602808 who could take a jellyfish out of a home aquarium and turn it into a metaphor worthy of godzilla
3602809 quietly creepy story with a hint of politics and a wealth of shivers
3602810 spell by drawing out the horror of everyday existence bit by bit and then tossing in some otherworldly weirdness
3602811 with his droopy posture and dead eyes just looks blank unplugged from the human race as harmless and animated as a houseplant
3602812 dreamlike plot winds this way and that as luxuriantly unhurried as that jellyfish
3602813 one of the pleasures of mr kurosawas films is how casually he tosses in ideas about contemporary life the state of the family the place of technology all while steadily shredding your nerves
3602814 kurosawa has always explored metropolitan anomie to chilling and profound effect
3602815 and in bright future he may have hit upon a perfect synecdoche of its manifestations
3602816 this time speaking to the incompatibilities of natural and artificial environments
3602817 sealed off from one another the sea creatures and the city pose no mutual threat but commingled the effects are disastrous with a spate of civilian attacks making the nightly news the message is that the modern metropolis has become so inorganic and rigidly structured and directed so inured to the potentials and pitfalls of natural life that when foreign organisms are introduced especially a jellyfish whose undulations are the very epitome of random organic movement catastrophe will ensue like a body that has forgotten its immunity to diseases the city succumbs because it has forgotten its innate defenses
3602818 kurosawa repeatedly puts the jellyfish out there as a grand signifier just waiting to be explained but never follows through thus allowing for any number of interpretations
3602819 his mise en sc ne and cutting surprise and often transcend the stylistics of his historic exemplars
3602820 the phenomenological position that a persons identity is shaped not so much by what one has done but rather by what one hopes to become and when an individual cannot see who he will be or worse is reluctant to even imagine a future self positively or negatively then he is in the deepest sense nothing kurosawa obviously sees this as a problem that condemns the individual and the collective to oblivion a terrible existential understanding of being
3602821 when an individual sees the future as the temporal state that gives one meaning and begins to take the steps necessary to actualize it there are going to be growing pains fucking up is evidence of ones engagement with the world as yuji proves when he and a group of che guevara shirt wearing misfits one of the films many stunning images decide to loot his sisters office as a political act its a poor choice but as a social one it shows that yuji has only just begun to participate in the world
3602822 in the 11th hour his film diverts its gaze to an odd youth gang outfitted in starched white che t shirts rousing themselves from disillusioned torpor and in a stirring traveling shot hunting for relevance and confrontation in the streets as a waving flag of anarchic will it evokes the codas of discreet charm of the bourgeoisie as an ending it leaves you speechless
3602823 a meditation on a country whose youth is spiritually destitute in the aftermath of the bursting of the economic bubble and the 1995 sarin gas attacks by the aum shinrikyo cult
3602824 exerts a gnawing dread that slowly turns to something faintly like hope
3602825 f or a film about apocalyptic generational rebellion bright future is perversely quiet

3602876 he thought it would be a senior prank and that people would get a laugh out of it
3602877 it was a pretty serious event at our school theres been pranks but never anything close to this
3602878 personally and professionally i was a bit sickened i was concerned about the sanitation of the school and i also was concerned about the individual who would do something like this
3602879 he absolutely abused those animals and he is responsible for what happened at that school

3602903 that one tenth of a point decrease in the districts composite score is really insignificant from an educational standpoint
3602904 our composite this year is still a pretty darn strong score considering 99 percent of our students took the exam
3602905 we always look at our buildings we look at them individually and we look at a lot of dynamics particularly we look at all of our demographics we look at our kids and how they scored earlier as they came through the system
3602906 considering both high schools still remain in the top 8 percent in the nation im happy with that
3602907 i would not be surprised to see a change in the scores and the way that we do score across all three buildings when we add that third building because i think just logistically it will just change
3602908 it would not surprise if theres some shift but well wait and see theres never any guarantee

3602913 with the nfl preseason in august we knew that raffling preseason tickets a signed football and jerseys would be a great way to say thanks to our donors for taking just an hour of your day to donate during the summer
3602914 we understand most community members donate simply for the feeling they get from saving lives with their blood donation but having raffles for the blood donors makes it fun for the donors and our staff
3602915 he had no choice because he was walking into a room didnt realize zulas was there and it was like surprise he did whatever he had to do to protect his family
3602916 as we develop this industry we cannot stand idly by while the environment is destroyed we have to prevent damage to adjoining lands private properties and public infrastructures caused by poor quarry practices illegal quarry operations will not be tolerated and the security forces will be deployed to respond to these activities
3602917 i hope that in canada we will begin to discuss more issues like this as opposed to so many debates on the value of our presence in afghanistan becoming plagued with partisan arguments on false extremes
3602918 this is one way we can help ensure harriet gifford students return to school feeling good about themselves and ready to learn

3602922 it is a one time fee for those coming into the community
3602923 that would help us cover a portion of the deficit
3602924 this tells us if the equipment is telling us the truth
3602925 would oversee the finances and make sure the budget is tight
3602926 if we do it properly itd be a big help
3602927 im kind of surprised at three because i thought we wanted to do more this could be were just doing baby steps

3602939 were seeing an increase in consumer awareness of a variety of mobile advertising campaigns from text message to interactive games to mobile internet banner advertisements
3602940 with mobile phone usage growing its logical for more companies to seek mobile marketing as a way to reach their segmented targets in this direct and highly interactive medium
3602941 these findings indicate the degree to which the mobile phone is used as a marketing channel with enhanced handsets and flat rate data tariffs increasingly common it is only a matter of time before mobile internet advertising starts to rival the penetration of sms or text message marketing

3602950 you need me to open other file accesses for you
3602951 it takes a long time with having to use the audio output i am still busy with the one about the setting up of the slowtrain fascinating it is what we came so far to find out about i only regret that my colleagues could not hear it too youre so alike and yet so different miran do not remain in space we go there but we return to miran to the place of our birth to breed
3602952 as close as possible a female must have a reasonable territory so it is not necessarily the exact spot when we colonized the second continent the first generation females always needed some tons of earth from home there are laments written of the misery they suffered nonetheless for males it is easy but for females once the nesting instinct begins they must be at home if i live that long it will happen to me too
3602953 so although im tempted to keep you here i think youd better get on your way back there
3602954 on a one way trip with aliens never to return to your birth nest area to breed
3602955 i do not know if there is still anyone to return to
3602956 only selna survived that i know of and the injuries and the stress he had sustained caused sex changeover the hormonal imbalance is hard normally loaded as she was with administered male hormones shes uh unstable difficult to speak logically to when i briefly managed to contact her females are usually the cautious logical sex being older and more experienced but not during changeover
3602957 shes having the pmt of a lifetime loaded into one session it can make for interesting times with humans and its not of that magnitude so when were you last able to contact her
3602958 it was spools of copper and then wire from machines
3602959 we found people of interest there probably involved in the crime
3602960 at this point in the investigation we arent sure how they gained knowledge of this bremen quarry location
3602961 a theft of this significance i think theyre probably involved in some other thefts
3602962 but so far i cant link them to anything in this county
3602963 would that seem to you to constitute a reasonably accurate summation of your energetic activities over the last three t months captain
3602964 and would you care to offer any explanations or justifications for those actions other than those contained in your reports
3602965 i cant say im incredibly surprised to hear that captain
3602966 under the circumstances however i thought you might care to be present when i record my official response to president tylers demands that i immediately disavow your actions relieve you of command place you under arrest pending a well deserved court martial apologize to the sovereign union of monica and agree to submit this entire matter to the impartial investigation and arbitration of the office of frontier security
3602967 this is the admiral lieutenant i need to record a message to president roberto tyler
3602968 i apologize for not getting back to you more promptly as you know the current one way transmission lag to eroica station is well over forty minutes given that inevitable delay in our communications loop i judged it would be wiser to speak directly to captain terekhov and hear his version of the unfortunate events here in monica in person before speaking to you again
3602969 obviously i am deeply distressed by the loss of life both monican and manticoran
3602970 the destruction of so many ships and so much damage to the public property of the union are also deeply distressing to me and i must inform you that captain terekhov by his own admission to me in his formal reports acknowledges that his actions were completely unauthorized by any higher authority
3602971 i have carefully considered your requests that i disavow his actions remove him from his command formally apologize to your government for his actions and agree to submit this entire tragic affair to the investigation and arbitration of the office of frontier security and i am certain my queen could desire very few things more than a speedy just and fair resolution to all of the myriad questions accusations and claims and counter claims arising from events here in monica
3602972 while all of that is true i am also of the opinion that what my queen would even more strongly desire is for you and your government to explain to her why you have been directly assisting efforts to recruit support encourage and arm terrorist organizations engaged in active campaigns of assassination murder and destruction against the citizens of other sovereign star nations who have requested membership in the star kingdom of manticore i am further of the opinion that she would argue that my first responsibility is to protect those citizens from future attack and determine precisely who supplied those responsible for the attacks already carried out with the several tons of modern solarian weapons captain terekhov confiscated in the split system morover i fear her majesty is unlikely to repose the most lively possible confidence in the impartiality of any investigation by the solarian leagues office of frontier security and that she would be most displeased if the two surviving battlecruisers obviously provided to you by solarian interests should mysteriously disappear before that investigation could be completed to everyones satisfaction
3602973 obviously at this great distance from manticore i cannot know for certain what her majesty will ultimately decide when she considers these weighty matters
3602974 it is my judgment however as the senior officer present of the queens navy that until i do know what her decision is it is my duty and responsibility to maintain the status quo in this star system pending the arrival of the substantial reinforcements i have requested from home fleet which will undoubtedly arrive with dispatches directly from manticore
3602975 it is my earnest hope that this entire situation can be resolved as amicably as possile between the diplomatic representatives of two civilized star nations with no further loss of life or damage to property public or private

3602983 ab 2899 will revolutionize the way we do hiv testing in california and we strongly urge the governor to sign this bill
3602984 today in government funded programs extensive education and counseling is required for every person regardless of how many times they might have been tested treating the young person who is testing for the first time the same as a person in their forties or fifties who has been tested dozens of times doesnt make sense this important reform will allow ahf the largest hiv tester in california to do three times as many tests per hour as we do now the unanimous approval of the legislature for this common sense approach to hiv testing is very encouraging
3602985 this bill brings the requirements for hiv counseling in line with where we are today in our knowledge and understanding of hiv aids and other stds and it will allow us to focus our counseling efforts where they are most needed to those at high risk and those who may test positive
3602986 the california legislature has recognized the importance of this prudent public health legislation with its unanimous passage in both chambers when this bill is chaptered into law it will allow the department of public health and the state office of aids far more flexibility in its counseling regulations to best serve and reflect the needs of communities throughout california

3602991 hurts u 46 faces enough battles with its image and its perception without adding things like this theres nothing that cant be resolved if people sit down and talk in good faith
3602992 the district is letting all this money be haphazardly spent when they have an obligation to try and settle
3602993 if nothing has made the district come to the table this class action ruling should
3602994 needs to step in and make the tail wag the dog
3602995 he needs to be the one to ask what is it that we can do to resolve these issues to bring both parties to the table and try and hash out these issues
3602996 we were focused on doing the work but a lot of effort had to go to documenting that work
3602997 in terms of how the lawsuit affects the work that im doing
3602998 the plan that i had laid out it certainly will be looking at the lawsuit and what it might mean but it doesnt affect my day to day operations i have to continue to reach out to engage the different segments of the community if that has some kind of outcome on the lawsuit great but in regard to the lawsuit i have to be guided by the board and their attorneys
3602999 during the black hat conference last week a lot of vendors were talking about the importance of immediate detection and early disclosure and while this is critical it is only half the story

3603024 our requirements now are in excess of 46 000 tonnes a week
3603025 the objective of the quota is to minimise the quantity of supply because saudi wants to meet local demand
3603026 the government is now in discussions to increase the quota
3603027 for us cement is coming at 50 to 60 per cent less than what it was before
3603028 the backlog from last month is getting bigger and bigger every day and it is getting more desperate
3603029 i believe all the readymix companies are most definitely looking at importing cement themselves from other countries in europe and asia
3603030 if cement prices are going up and we have to import materials whatever the cost the only place we can pass it on is to our customers who will pass it on to their clients
3603031 if we compare it with june last year a round trip between bahrain and saudi used to take nine hours and now it is more than 20

3603068 theres at least one of the ayatollah bunches thats gotten hold of their own duplicating machine neumann says one of the vignelli machines got it used from freytag when he bought a new model theyve been on the market for more than a year now the machines i mean a trickle at first now its a pretty wide stream theyre coming out of tyrol mostly but there are already some knock offs on the market
3603069 it means theyre funded the group of would be ayatollahs i mean and well funded even second hand a vignelli will set you back a couple thousand dollars the price will be coming down of course but for now its almost entirely print shops that are buying them for small runs theyre cheaper than setting type
3603070 while we are generally pleased with our 2008 progress headwinds associated with rising energy and feedstock costs continued in the second quarter and as such necessary price increases were implemented to recover these unprecedented cost increases
3603071 at the same time we remain committed to fully optimizing our production assets to improve overall efficiencies to that end we are pleased to have recently approved an important series of capital projects to upgrade infrastructure at our world scale belpre ohio site and are developing additional improvement projects for our other global manufacturing locations by combining responsive pricing with an aggressive cost improvement strategy we intend to restore kraton to an acceptable sustainable level of profitability

3603073 i feel there was 20 community members that were involved and the rest of the community has no idea what was going on
3603074 with the jail project i feel we have shown we are very sensitive as neighbors
3603075 we have bent over backward to make this a beautiful facility and i am sure that if we put a maintenance facility there it will also be a beautiful facility
3603076 i went to a lot of the public meetings and i heard the people say why are you doing this to us well were doing this to you because weve spent a lot of money its always been our plan its never been a secret were going to put a good facility there the people of st charles better work with us or get used to it
3603077 i dont want people to feel that this was shoved down their throats
3603078 i know its just a concept plan but ive seen concepts carry all the way through to the final project
3603079 the main thing we want to do is get on with our lives
3603080 they get the land they want and we get to keep our home itll just be a different address
3603081 dan has 20 years experience as a law enforcement officer
3603082 i retired from the department and to make that change in leadership you have to change the title
3603083 i cant be chief of police its a nonpaid position
3603084 the village will still be protected without them the laid off officers
3603085 were going to get the same amount of officers on the street as we always have theres going to be some changing in the structure of the department to allow for that
3603086 when i was chief before we didnt have the administrative staff
3603087 its much more helpful to have those command personnel in place to run the department
3603088 it will all be internal and the department will carry on as it has in the past
3603089 dan and linda are both taking on extra responsibility they are both taking on extra duty more hours and neither one is receiving an increase in pay in their current salaries
3603090 they understand the position the village is in right now with our current finances
3603091 there is no way to tell if something is going to be successful if you dont try it out
3603092 thats the whole aim of this to make public works services more predictable
3603093 our goal is education if we have zero tickets to write perfect
3603094 we dont have all the answers figured out for the parking ban
3603095 thats why its six months theres going to be trials and tribulations
3603096 right now the cost of steel and everything else is so high that were taking this all the way through bid to see what it would cost first
3603097 neither party is a winner neither party is a loser we both bent a little bit
3603098 at the end of the day its not perfect but both villages got something out of it isnt that what compromise is all about
3603099 that is when the relationship between the two communities started to go downhill
3603100 i think the village did need its own police department
3603101 we dont want this to create an eyesore for the residents who have been there for many years
3603102 would not be in the best interest of the community
3603103 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3603104 in tune with public opinion and hes aware that public opinion doesnt support killing someone who has such a diminished role as an accomplice
3603105 he should be given life without parole in a maximum security unit and perhaps he could serve his time with the man who pulled the trigger
3603106 the juxtaposition of one man who did not kill being executed and another man who did kill being pardoned just stuck in peoples craw

3603108 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3603109 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3603110 i think whats interesting is after all these years that ted kaczynski would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims
3603111 i think there is a world market for maybe 5 computers

3603114 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church
3603115 only in christ are all things in communion he is the point of convergence of all hearts and beings and therefore the bridge and the shortest way from each to each
3603116 the doctrine of justification by faith is in fact the great ecumenical doctrine
3603117 the gospel portrait implies that jesus would be found guilty by the self conscious religious majority of any age and background
3603118 great now the half of the men will have to stop taking up two seats and a space in front of them will have to stand up instead
3603119 wed fit more riders on the train if half of the men who sit close their legs sit up straight and stop taking up two seats and a space in front of them
3603120 uh 50 people per car on a 10 car train is 500 additional people not 200
3603121 seatless subway excellent idea to move more people i would love to stand all the time i think mta should make the whole train seatless during rush hours
3603122 whats the term for mathematical illiteracy innumeracy people really dont get it yes more people will be going through the doors per unit time but for people standing already the feeling simply cannot feel different and seated riders at rush inhibit free flow of standing passengers fact
3603123 if its that bad then ridership would go down instead of continually increasing what a bunch of whiners im impressed with how many listeners are not listening this is a pilot program that will attempt to address overcrowding and move commuters more quickly during rush hour which is a good thing
3603124 and why arent there more benches on the platforms how much can a wooden bench cost
3603125 but it will eliminate conflicts of seating and idiots kicking their legs out and people trying to take up a seat with bags

3603131 of course for some of the events you have to use treats so they will try harder
3603132 the parrots do have a tendency to climb up the rope anyway but a treat at the top helps
3603133 is that when they dont feel good they dont swim well michael kind of performs independently of his feelings
3603134 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3603135 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3603136 michaels just so good and i think what makes it so special is that hes so good in this environment he raises his game in an environment where so few people do that he stands out a little bit more
3603137 the struggle is no longer getting it there but trying to market and promote once it is there
3603138 its all social network type stuff blogs are a huge part of the equation too and internet radio like woxy com also plays a big role
3603139 i just send out bulletins on myspace and i have an e mail list that i send out
3603140 i dont know why scott wasnt in the mix for the other nhl jobs this summer anyone who follows the a will tell you hes been the best coach in our league and deserved a shot
3603141 not even close definitely not top 5 and maybe not even top 10 dont get me wrong they have some players but scott got more out of them than anyone could have expected
3603142 his teams were the most prepared in the league the best conditioned and the hardest working
3603143 with his focus on defense he took a pretty good team to 55 wins scott showed me that i still have more to learn
3603144 the islanders have two options work through the issues and commit completely to ted nolan or shake hands and say goodbye more than themselves or even their fan base they owe that to ted
3603145 in my view the man best suited for the opportunity is paul maurice im aware maurice may not be the most exhilarating choice but the islanders do not need exhilarating theyve done that
3603146 ive seen some stories from people making it sound like this is a job anyone with experience would not want this is a big opportunity there are plenty of reasons to go after that job
3603147 to this former pr flak an august 12 press conference looks good yankees in minnesota mets in washington favres destination already known i would think a new islanders coach would fill most of newsdays backpage the following day big name hire or not

3603149 it is necessary to impose a sentence that will ensure that the defendant will never again be free
3603150 the most loving caring responsible respectable and most decent person i have ever known
3603151 weve got more violence and now we dont know who to talk to about it
3603152 we are deeply concerned because it leaves the radical extremist outfits free to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghanistan border but clearly our side of the border too
3603153 its not like theres suddenly going to be a war between the two countries
3603154 in the absence of greater trust you will see a kind of pincer movement against pakistan by afghanistan and india and pakistans establishment and state turning toward whatever tools it has at its disposal to defend itself
3603155 we made more progress in terms of peace than we have in the past 60 years
3603156 how can we get talks back on track if the prime minister the other people we meet with cant control the military the intelligence services
3603157 india did not try to draw mileage on that and get an outline for a real agreement
3603158 the forgery anecdote is part of a larger story about the failure and misuse of american intelligence in the run up to the iraq war especially in human intelligence
3603159 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3603160 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3603161 its too bad there arent more people its a nice atmosphere
3603162 we are pleased with our restaurants here and our brands positioning amidst the wide expanse of the games and its spectators
3603163 obviously it would have been nice to see more numbers earlier
3603164 but we are seeing a growing trend which will continue once the track and field competition begins in the 91 000 seat birds nest later this week
3603165 we are aware of this issue we are already planning to invite more people to the olympic green we definitely want more people and spectators
3603166 the forbidden city takes two hours to walk around and thats just a little bit compared to here
3603167 here in beijing there have been a few who have requested that more people be admitted into what are known as the olympic common areas and the organizing committee has been working to find appropriate means of doing this which we welcome
3603168 if its warming up and scaring the other team out there thats perfectly fine
3603169 they know that were coming back to redeem ourselves and im pretty sure that they watch us a lot
3603170 has been circled on my calendar for about two years now
3603171 weve got veterans were preparing ourselves every night were showcasing what weve been doing the last three years getting ready for this moment
3603172 so we cant afford to go out and be lackadaisical
3603173 we were not looking ahead i thought we played with really good energy in spurts and played some really terrific basketball
3603174 our goal wasnt to win by a certain margin it was to really work hard and keep up our pressure and then once that was done we just worked on a few other things the main thing was just to keep some consistency so overall i was very pleased with tonight
3603175 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
3603176 engaged in the business of discovering and developing artists in the music industry
3603177 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3603178 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3603179 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3603180 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3603181 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3603182 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3603183 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3603184 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3603185 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3603186 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3603187 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3603188 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3603189 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3603190 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3603191 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3603192 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3603193 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3603194 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3603195 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3603196 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3603197 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3603198 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3603199 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3603200 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3603201 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3603202 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3603203 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3603204 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3603205 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3603206 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3603207 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3603208 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3603209 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3603210 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3603211 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3603212 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3603213 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3603214 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3603215 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3603216 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3603217 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3603218 we have to prove that what he did in thailand was wrong under british law
3603219 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3603220 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3603221 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3603222 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3603223 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3603224 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3603225 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3603226 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3603227 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3603228 i didnt write this wikipedia entry it may look like i did but i didnt im a published writer so its not inconceivable that one of my many hot young fans citation needed wrote this ill look it over though just to make sure everythings accurate yup looks good
3603229 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3603230 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3603231 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3603232 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3603233 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3603234 this robust financial performance was driven by strong growth in operating revenues improved equity earnings from affiliates higher interest and other income and effective cost control
3603235 just shake it off thats all you can do shake it off

3603240 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3603241 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3603242 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3603243 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3603244 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3603245 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3603246 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3603247 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3603248 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

3603256 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
3603257 we have to fight against racism prejudice discrimination and stereotypes in my opinion people from all over the world should be like a big family i know that this is difficult to make this dream come true but we need to try to do this

3603261 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3603262 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3603263 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3603264 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3603265 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3603266 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions

3603272 its never been as explicitly stated that the democratic party supports a womans decision to have their child and offers her practical support to have her child its an historic step forward
3603273 this plank makes room for people with moral convictions about abortion a lot of people are going to find their convictions represented here
3603274 in the end the interpretation of the platform lies in the hands of the candidate
3603275 while the platform still falls short of the catholic ideal we live in this world and we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life then weve done a good thing
3603276 anything that recognizes roe v wade as legitimate is unacceptable from a catholic point of view but we live in the real world our faith is not unexposed in our pocket but rather meant to transform the political process as it exists this gets us beyond roe roe has turned out to be a legal dead end and a moral dead end
3603277 it took her a while to get going and as the season wore on she wore down physically
3603278 but now physically shes in the best shape shes been in in a long time
3603279 the exciting thing about lindsey is shes so far ahead at this time than she was at this same time a year ago shes prepared to have her best season
3603280 she passes really well which is probably her biggest asset shes a very smart attacker she handles the ball well shes very skilled and really knows how to play the game
3603281 whitney is one of our better athletes at that position shes a little smaller at 510
3603282 alex has actually gotten taller and is now every bit of 62
3603283 she steinmetz can play the left or the right and if she passes well shes definitely going to play a lot more
3603284 she had a real good outing against lsu but she got some freshman jitters in the fifth game

3603287 carlos cuellar has been a great player for the football club and inevitably there has been speculation about him playing in the premiership

3603290 every time we mention signs there seems to be more and more and theyre getting bigger and bigger
3603291 when the aquarium was built here we thought what a great opportunity
3603292 we have to be very careful in what we bring in
3603293 some of these things have just come out of conservation
3603294 i think its almost as big as the whale sharks
3603295 we must seize the moment we must not let it pass
3603296 come to the table not looking for what you can get but what you can give
3603297 the good news is there may be still a possibility to move this forward and conclude negotiations within the earlier agreed timeframe that is end 2008
3603298 i will play the role of a midwife if the negotiating parties want delivery of the baby

3603311 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3603312 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3603313 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3603314 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

3603316 hey hindi pala noticable masyado ang loss of realism if i tone down the physics
3603317 we still need the tackles flying in and the high tempo in games to let games flow and the referees also have a responsibility as well
3603318 but the important thing is there is now some consistency there are now rules last year was there or wasnt there a rule where you couldnt surround the referee i couldnt tell you now theres a rule you cant
3603319 its the captain who has that responsibility to go and speak to the referee the others guys are going to get booked now we all know that theres some consistency from the referees association from the panel from the players
3603320 its unfair to pick one person or one club out because weve all committed it
3603321 i could show you 100 videos of different players and different clubs committing offences weve all done it thats in the past and we move on trying to make it better
3603322 the wills there definitely to improve this is a step in the right direction because the only way we were going to move forward was by taking some responsibility
3603323 i have been in this job 10 years now and i sense a mood for something to happen
3603324 robert you need to focus on the crack that last shower really pockmarked us we dont want to lose any hull integrity

3603332 may zack snyder have his way and not allow warner bros to edit the film down from its supposedly perfect running time
3603333 roberto orci and alex kurtzman met with snyder twice during the later stages of pre production to further revise the script
3603334 we gotta get in on this is there any way we can take this movie and just turn it into a two and a half hour commercial for our
3603335 hey this movie isnt really about robots or anything i thought it was about a nerd who cant get laid and besides all these retarded jokes are going to distract from this whole robot invasion idea
3603336 and ozymandias well of course hes the smart guy so he has to be a slim scrawny nerd
3603337 ozymandias is too thin night owl is too fit etc
3603338 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3603339 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3603340 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3603341 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3603342 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3603343 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3603344 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3603345 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3603346 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3603347 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3603348 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3603349 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3603350 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3603351 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

3603355 if youre looking to make good money in the online casinos field you need an internet presence and a great website
3603356 im floored this online casinos news is shocking but also somewhat exciting to hear
3603357 i can say with little doubt that this online casinos argument is sound
3603358 and i believe this will be a cornerstone in online casinos thinking
3603359 using simple online casinos methods we can look for the silver lining and profit margin in our work
3603360 well significant profits next quarter with the release of our new online casinos products

3603363 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain
3603364 he is a courageous patriotic american who stands up for what he believes
3603365 the mccain campaign is determined to give their paris hilton ad a run for its money in the desperation department and theyve succeeded only in shining a light on the fact that the john mccain of today is unrecognizable from the john mccain of just a couple years ago the real question is what happened to the john mccain we used to know and why he changed overnight into a george bush nominee with a karl rove campaign
3603366 any problem with record keeping and documentation in aircraft maintenance is a concern because thats one of the things that underpins the safety of the plane
3603367 is it just a maintenance documentation problem or was there a failure to do any maintenance work
3603368 the big presidential debates coming up are we still excited about that barack obama wants to debate about foreign policy and john mccain wants to debate about the big band era
3603369 theres a new poll that was done by the lifetime network that is determined to have more american women whod rather car pool or go on vacation with barack obama than john mccain 51 for obama to 31 for mccain and that 31 fell to just 2 when it was specified that mccain would be driving in that carpool
3603370 since congress went on recess oil prices have dropped to 118 a barrel thats like a 30 drop from the record high you know maybe congress should take more vacations huh you ever notice whenever these people leave town things just seem to get better
3603371 actually analysts say a weak economy is causing less energy use resulting in falling oil prices yeah basically the worse the economy the lower the oil prices which means if bush could serve one more term oil would be free
3603372 well barack obama and john mccain have both switched their positions on offshore oil drilling they both used to be against it but now they say they are for it under the right circumstances like if it helps them get elected
3603373 according to the huffington post its being reported that barack obama may name indiana senator evan bayh as his vice presidential running mate tomorrow tomorrow thats what heres what we know about evan bayh he was going to run for president then he dropped out after getting less than 2 of the vote less that 2 he was actually losing to low fat milk
3603374 and barack obama now says he is open to offshore oil drilling so apparently when he promised change he was talking about his mind i guess thats what that was
3603375 well john mccains daughter is now writing a childrens book based on her fathers life see the research has been difficult because as you know much of mccains early life story is only available through folklore so theres not much written down
3603376 yesterday was barack obamas birthday i believe he turned a little to the right if im not mistaken
3603377 saya mencoba bermain lebih sabar dan tidak terburu buru dalam menghadapi lawan

3603468 i wanted particularly to allow those trees and those trunks to be seen and the space beyond and into infinity to be observed so those who sat in the sanctuary would perceive the grandeur of space out beyond and around them
3603469 when the trees that surround the chapel grow up they will become the framework become a part of the tree forms and branches that inevitably arise from the growing trees adjacent to it i used the glass so that the natural growth the sky and sea beyond became the definition of their environment this is done to give the congregation protection in services and at the same time to create the sense of outer as well as inner space
3603470 the great cathedrals of redwood inspired me to use the redwoods here in earlier days all over the face of the earth there were chapels in glades and the woods which were meeting places for the priests and the people the chapel was to be a place for people to meet and think and contemplate the forces of nature and god almighty the setting of this chapel is to receive people the wayfarers

3603479 india is home to approximately 2 5 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus hiv the third largest number of cases of any country in the world and is recognized as the source of increasing hiv prevalence among its south asian neighbors
3603480 intimate partner violence ipv has been described as being associated with heterosexual transmission of hiv to women in india and elsewhere
3603481 in this first national population based study of the relationship of husbands violence against wives to wives hiv infection status as indicated via diagnostic testing married indian women who experienced both physical and sexual ipv demonstrated an hiv infection prevalence approximately four times greater than that of non abused women
3603482 prevention of ipv may augment efforts to reduce the spread of hiv aids
3603483 findings of the present study based on both the large population based sample and the use of standard diagnostic testing for hiv infection should serve to confirm the nature of this relationship and move public health policy makers and practitioners to increase recognition of ipv as a critically important target in the global fight against hiv aids

3603500 realists see american idealism as a dangerous distraction from the unsentimental pursuit of core national interests but progressives believe u s foreign policy works best when it reflects the moral sentiments and political values of the american people recognizing that what happens within states is often more important for world order than what happens between states progressives understand that the peaceful spread of liberal democracy is a strategic imperative for america

3603511 we came to the conclusion yesterday that given where markets are it would not be prudent to go ahead with the due diligence
3603512 people know how to ring up and make an appointment at their health clinic but they dont really know what to do about toxins in the air and global warming right
3603513 so the whole thing is how do we translate the tremendous amount of anxiety and interest in addressing major environmental issues into something concrete that people can do whose effect is measurable and significant
3603514 people are frustrated by their inability to cope with environmental problems in their apartments and their neighborhoods
3603515 provides a service thats needed educating people about what theyre up against and showing them that they can do something themselves while waiting for larger societal solutions

3603518 i had it in a sample of water from the bronx river and unfortunately it died
3603519 so much of what environmentalism involves is things you shouldnt do and that can be very unsatisfying

3603523 hoyer also has the strong support of many of the partys conservative
3603524 many of the partys successful candidates ran as moderates and democrats hold power on the basis of a loan of votes from middle of the road americans who simply could not stomach bush republicanism anymore the loan can be recalled at any moment
3603525 well somebodys been on steroids because on tuesday the muscular middle took control of america say goodbye to the era of rovian base mobilization say goodbye to the era of conservative dominance that began in 1980 on tuesday 47 percent of the voters were self described moderates according to exit polls and they asserted their power by voting for the democrats in landslide proportions
3603526 in 1986 even the reagan led gop lost the senate
3603527 during the last six years our country has paid a terrible price for polarization

3603529 he webb liked to think that he was writing for the young rifleman wanted him to say as he out the book down this is real this is what it was like the way it smelled how it felt he also wanted to impart dignity to the riflemans service without emeshing him in the tangled politics of the war the grunt wasnt his only target he wanted his law school classmates and the segment of the generation they represented to read it as well

3603533 the cook political report a nonpartisan handicapper of races added the races of several republicans to its chart of highly competitive contests including the one for
3603534 the prospect of a bloomberg presidential candidacy delights me i grant you that just last week i was excited about barack obama but that is because i think the more the merrier especially if they are truly bright unencumbered by a need to defend the iraq war and willing to look at things afresh this is particularly the case with bloomberg who has an unorthodox approach to politics he says what he means and he means what he says and he tells it like it is
3603535 but by nightfall american troops had abandoned all the positions in eastern and central baghdad that they had set up last week with iraqi forces as part of a search for a missing american soldier

3603537 tony fabrizio a pollster working for several republican candidates said the president did his party more harm than good by highlighting a troublesome issue and seeming to change course so close to election day
3603538 it makes it look like they have a confused policy
3603539 now the question will be every day what are the parameters of flexibility
3603540 by allowing violence and disorder to spread throughout the country the bush administration has broken faith with the iraqi people and ignored its responsibilities it has placed u s security in jeopardy by creating the preconditions for the sort of terrorist safe haven the president repeatedly warns about and by demonstrating that no ally can rely on america to be there when it counts

3603543 one of the first calls i made after the levees broke was to joe lieberman
3603544 joes record in the senate what hes done for connecticut and the nation justifies why i have broken from our democratic party to endorse him a party both of us respect people are tired of the slash and burn politics in washington these days joe is the type of leader who can take us in a new direction

3603547 the democrats dependence on moderate voters and moderate candidates belies republican claims that a democratic victory would bring radically liberal politics to washington in fact the first imperative of democratic congressional leaders if their party is successful will be finding policies ideas and rhetoric to allow the partys progressives and moderates to get along and govern effectively together
3603548 collectively the group could tilt the balance of power within the party which has been struggling to define itself in recent elections
3603549 there are two main groups of moderate democrats in the house the blue dog coalition a caucus of socially conservative and moderate members formed in 1994 and the new democrat coalition a caucus of centrists formed in 1997 while there are differences between the two the blue dogs tend to be more rural and southern with occasional alliances with republicans while the new democrats are more suburban and wealthy and place a premium on party loyalty there are members who belong to both both of course have a stake in helping the centrist candidates succeed

3603660 our summers looking really good the bookings are way up over the last several years
3603661 with high gas prices perhaps people are coming up the gunflint trail rather than going to the rockies
3603662 we know theyre just putting less miles on period no matter where they go when theyre down to this five six seven miles to the gallon when theyre towing their rigs
3603663 and our campgrounds are taking a beating on it we know the campers in the big rigs are just not coming out as much this summer and i think theyre just hunkering down a little bit more
3603664 ive had people call me on the phone and say we were going to go down south to florida with the big campers but gas prices are keeping us at home
3603665 gas is always the topic of conversation at the front desk when people come in
3603666 so the gas prices are on peoples minds my feeling is people are going to take a vacation and camping is something they can do with the family and its relatively inexpensive
3603667 i dont think theres any doubt that the high gas prices have helped our business
3603668 i dont know how many people have said to me this year we own our own canoes but were renting them because we are able to drive the toyota or prius up and save gas and then rent canoes rather than haul our own
3603669 in the last two weeks theres been a little phenomenon of the campgrounds getting busy
3603670 in fact our campground here at sawbill was booked last thursday for the first time ive ever seen it booked on a thursday in my life and ive been here 50 years
3603671 i think whats happening there is that gas prices have moderated a little bit and schools are about to start and people are saying lets get the heck out of town
3603672 estoy un poco sorprendido porque desde que llegu aqu me han controlado cuatro veces y me han sacado mucha sangre voy a estar muy d bil para la final de 100 metros

3603680 it was probably the most disgusting scene that ive ever been involved in as far as human waste and filth and the sad thing about it is you had a wife and four kids who were confined to these four walls and were not permitted to go outside
3603681 chicken and chips was pretty much their diet there was evidence of some other things in there like old pizza boxes but from what i understand those were his and the kids and her were not allowed to partake
3603682 from what i understand he just left and didnt come back and she got word somehow i dont know what happened but she got word somehow that he got involved with another lady
3603683 nobody in this community knew that he had children or a wife thats whats so strange about this this family was so afraid of this man that he said they are not to leave and they did not leave
3603684 he was always talking to my son and to my boyfriend just being normal like normal people do

3603724 dan has 20 years experience as a law enforcement officer
3603725 i retired from the department and to make that change in leadership you have to change the title
3603726 i cant be chief of police its a nonpaid position
3603727 the village will still be protected without them the laid off officers
3603728 were going to get the same amount of officers on the street as we always have theres going to be some changing in the structure of the department to allow for that
3603729 when i was chief before we didnt have the administrative staff
3603730 its much more helpful to have those command personnel in place to run the department
3603731 it will all be internal and the department will carry on as it has in the past
3603732 dan and linda are both taking on extra responsibility they are both taking on extra duty more hours and neither one is receiving an increase in pay in their current salaries
3603733 they understand the position the village is in right now with our current finances
3603734 neither party is a winner neither party is a loser we both bent a little bit
3603735 at the end of the day its not perfect but both villages got something out of it isnt that what compromise is all about
3603736 that is when the relationship between the two communities started to go downhill
3603737 i think the village did need its own police department
3603738 theres only one way that we can do the improvements of the roads in wauconda and that is through referendum
3603739 we know for sure we cant do our own financing because with the motor fuel tax money it has already been earmarked for other projects

3603755 his recent statements indicating that the interim government has no intention of honouring that undertaking are of great concern
3603756 i have really enjoyed the summer so far from a personal point of view
3603757 the competition now is pretty healthy as we have five bowlers with stuart broad fred flintoff harmy ryan sidebottom and myself fighting for four places
3603758 on top of that you have all the guys in county cricket and simon jones coming back its all healthy and keeps you on your toes
3603759 so im not sure if i think i belong there in the team but if i can keep putting in the performances and keep taking wickets and if i can do as much as i can to impress the selectors they wont be able to leave me out
3603760 consistency is something i have been striving for and the confidence i have got from my consistency and the wickets ive taken this summer has been great
3603761 the one thing that has pleased me more than anything is the way i have kept my speeds up as i have bowled quite a lot of overs this summer
3603762 i have not been used to bowling this many overs in a summer so keeping my speeds up in the mid eighties and sometimes a bit more is encouraging

3603768 hes always up to race and he always performs when it matters i think altogether that makes him a great performer better than the rest of the world obviously
3603769 it doesnt get any easier to be honest but certainly the experience and the knowledge that youve done it before helps knowing hopefully that you can probably do it again i really wanted to race today

3603774 he knew how to carry out his holy will with the hebrews
3603775 through the presence life and powers of his son the son of david
3603776 only if they believe the word of god through messiah and moses
3603777 it was time for israel to go to the land that their god had promised to their ancestors
3603778 but only through the spirit of his dearly beloved son
3603779 until satan concerned himself about the birth and manifestation of the king messiah
3603780 their messiah could be born from any of their woman at any given time
3603781 never thought of the tree of life descending from paradise
3603782 to convince or force satan and the pharaoh of egypt to let the hebrews go to their land
3603783 for the egyptians to begin to believe that the god of the hebrews was more powerful than satan
3603784 even satan and some other people wanted to see for themselves
3603785 but our god did not allow them to come close to him
3603786 to touch the hearts and burn clean inside the people from darkness
3603787 just as he would be speaking to him person to person in the holy of holies
3603788 this was the most important place on earth for the messiah to speak to israel
3603789 anyone that would enter into this holy place of the most holy then he would drop dead
3603790 remove your sandals for the ground you are standing is holy
3603791 i am the god of your ancestors speaking to you
3603792 they may go to the land promised to their ancestors generations ago
3603793 but only through the wonderful working powers of the tree of life shining and burning in their hearts
3603794 life and liberty for all of them to enjoy at last
3603795 of the tree of life our king messiah of all times our lord jesus christ the son of god
3603796 may take place in the heart of moses and in the hearts of his brothers as well
3603797 i did not manifest myself to them with mine name
3603798 because he neither knows me as the god of the hebrews and much less he knows the tree of life the king messiah
3603799 the pharaoh has added sin to his sins and to the sins of egypt as well
3603800 they had not honored his name as moses honored it when he first heard it from his lips within the midst of the fire on the mountaintop of sinai
3603801 our heavenly father was angry with the rebellion of the egyptians against the word of his son in the burning bush
3603802 he needed it to put his people in the land of israel almost immediately
3603803 but only in the land of canaan the present israel
3603804 where our god created them in his hands in his image and in according to his likeness
3603805 through the spirit of the sacrificed blood of the lamb of god the son of david since the foundation of the heavens and the earth
3603806 preferred to shed the sacrificed blood of the son of david his only begotten son
3603807 only by the powers of the spirit of the sacrificed blood and life of his dear son
3603808 just as he was important and his atoning blood in the doorpost of their homes so they may escape the angel of death for ever and ever
3603809 thus to enter the promised land of the king messiah the son of david
3603810 he just needed them to obey him and his king messiah
3603811 to escape the certain destruction and death from the angel of death and satan
3603812 you will see what he is about to do for you against your enemies
3603813 on that crucial hour of their lives between going back to egypt or dying beneath the violent waters of the red sea
3603814 moses realized also that the spirit of the supernatural blessing of the sacrificed blood is forever
3603815 they may continue freely on their way to cross the sea
3603816 just enough time for the hebrews to begin to cross the sea and enter into the desert
3603817 the egyptians and their horses may drown beneath the waters and you will never see them again
3603818 our heavenly father glorified his holy name over them according to the words he told moses
3603819 the lord god has crowned himself with glory and triumph by throwing the egyptians and its horses into the waters of the red sea
3603820 it would feel even thirstier than before and probably die on the spot too
3603821 become another pile of sand in this desert in no time
3603822 full of the power of blessing and salvation from heaven above to grant them what they needed
3603823 so sweet as milk and honey from heaven to drink
3603824 was the king messiah our lord jesus christ the son of david
3603825 by eating the meat of the sacrifice lamb back in egypt
3603826 god showed moses the tree that he should throw into the bitter waters so they may become sweet as milk and honey to drink
3603827 with the body life spirit and sweetness of the king messiah the son of david
3603828 i will not bring upon you any of the infirmities that i brought upon the egyptians
3603829 i am the lord your god that gives you health and takes care of you
3603830 but he was with them in his spirit to fulfill the will of god
3603831 sweetened miraculously with the tree of life from his holy kingdom
3603832 they had truly drink out from their king messiah as saying that they were now part of the tree of life eternally
3603833 forgetting like this all what the lord god had done for them
3603834 i will be there waiting for you and your people with your herds
3603835 but this time the rock will give water nonetheless in abundance to drink
3603836 i will be there for you as i was with you in egypt and in all of its places
3603837 but it was also to enter into the virgin daughter of king david from the tribe of judah so the messiah would be born sinless
3603838 sweetened bitter water by the tree and water from the rock and the holy spirit of the law of the life of the messiah
3603839 they would lift up the king messiah nailed to the crossed trees of adam and eve on top of the eternal rock outside jerusalem
3603840 but also into the brand new heavenly jerusalem where peace and the eternal glory of the messiah abound
3603841 through the desert for forty years to finally introduce them into israel for the messiah to be received by them extraordinarily
3603842 the flesh bones blood and the life of the living king messiah the son of david
3603843 as the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world
3603844 when a man believes in me he does not believe in me only but in the one who sent me when he looks at me in truth he sees the one who sent me the heavenly father for the father and i are one i have come out from the father to meet you today that is why i know him and he knows me very well in fact i have come into the world as a light so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness but be transferred to the light more shining than the sun and the stars of the heavens
3603845 our heavenly father would have sent it to the world already
3603846 has come out from the light of the heavenly father and from his dear son our lord jesus christ
3603847 the spirit of the son of david is so vital in our lives nowadays
3603848 this is the holy sacrificed blood that satan intended to stop from entering into adam and israel
3603849 if they do believe in jesus christ as the son of god then they would automatically believe in our heavenly father
3603850 it may enter into the life of humanity to stay forever and ever
3603851 this is the only true light that outshines the souls of men from darkness to the outmost heavenly holiness
3603852 he needs to establish his holy temple and his tree of life in israel as well
3603853 but to know eternally that the lord jesus christ is the son of david
3603854 as their only king messiah possible for the salvation of their eternal living souls
3603855 but only in the name of his dearly beloved son the son of david our lord jesus christ
3603856 you will never be the same person again on earth
3603857 literately filled with the light of the tree of life
3603858 that there will be no darkness within you forevermore but only light
3603859 just as his dear son jesus christ is the light of the angels and the light of humankind as well
3603860 and satan will never be able to defeat you again
3603861 believes the one who sent him to israel to fulfill his promise of blessings and eternal salvation from sin to them and the entire world
3603862 the man that sees me does not only see me but also the heavenly father for he is the one that sent the prophets to israel and finally his son on these days to complete his will according to his eternal hearts desire
3603863 it was fulfilled for the glory and honor of his wonderful working miracle name when they saw jesus christ before them in israel
3603864 just as moses saw him for the first time in the midst of the burning bush on mount sinai
3603865 moses continued to see the son of david in the most holy place of the holies
3603866 he will not put up with you and your sins
3603867 so you may be victorious over them and possess their lands
3603868 where all the nations of humankind will dwell in the spirit of eternal love peace joy happiness health and everlasting prosperity
3603869 he bears my name from eternity to eternity within his sanctified life
3603870 to deliver you from the power of your captors thus to go on your way through the desert to the promised land
3603871 but now he lives in the power of the light of the tree of light
3603872 sanctified daily by the wonderful working miracle power of the spirit of the sacrificed blood of the king messiah the son of david our lord jesus christ
3603873 if you only can make the spirit of the son of david who is not only the king messiah for israel and humankind but also bears within his holy life the precious and glorious name from our father
3603874 he may be with each one of you today and well into beyond eternity
3603875 has led the hebrews out of egypt and through the hostile and barren desert of the nations to live in the promised land of canaan today
3603876 not only fulfill the spirit of the ten commandments but also clean every heart and soul of man woman and child from the power of sin
3603877 was to be born in the promised land to be forever and ever the king of the hebrews
3603878 the son of god the son of david for the house of israel
3603879 but he has existed always within our heavenly father and his holy spirit as well since beyond the first days of eternity
3603880 spoke to moses and the high priests of israel face to face almost every day of their lives from within the most holiest place from the holies
3603881 is with you today as he was with moses and the hebrews in the ancient days
3603882 if you are willing to believe in the heavenly father and everything he has done for your well being on earth and in the new world to come
3603883 where all is love glory and peace for ever and ever for you and your loved ones also
3603884 he will bless your food water and give you good health all the days of your life until the end of time
3603885 he is your resurrection before the heavenly father in the last day
3603886 to eat and drink from the tree of life and of good health eternally
3603887 he will never permit that any sickness diseases or viruses would invade your home or life
3603888 even though you are not faithful with him at times
3603889 for the glory of his holy name that dwells within his holy heart blood and life for ever and ever
3603890 he will make sure that your sons and daughters are born without any curses sickness or deceases
3603891 he will be with each one of them as he was with moses for example

3603914 and getting third in the 200 free four years ago you know when i do lose in a race like that and in circumstances like that it motivates me even more to try and swim faster
3603915 i think over the past four years ive been able to make some pretty significant drops in the 200 free
3603916 i couldnt ask for anything else so far from my first three medal races
3603917 weve done everything that ive wanted to do so far
3603918 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history and the olympics have been around for so many years is a pretty amazing accomplishment
3603919 its definitely an honour ive been able to spend some time with carl lewis and exchange a few words with spitz here and there so its pretty amazing

3603924 i played really clean matches in the past and the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more
3603925 apparently it was an improvised explosive device that hit the bus
3603926 it made a very big difference it spoiled our strategy and we were caught between attacking and defending
3603927 had we lost today then i think it would have difficult
3603928 of course we are sorry that we couldnt be there and had to watch on the television but that was our destiny
3603929 when we were in shanghai it was like we were playing in an under 20 tournament or competition like that because there was only football

3603941 newport realizes their database is black people and they do the targeting
3603942 its similar to other things in urban areas theres a dedicated effort to sell them to minorities
3603943 it certainly seems like the tobacco industry has a pretty strong hold on our community
3603944 but look at the marketing campaigns they seem to be targeting the african american community

3604180 obviously he has got a mother how would you like your mother being attacked that way
3604181 esto quiere decir que tanto la idea como el dise o y la fabricaci n debe ser nuestra
3604182 recuerdo que la ltima vez que vine las casetas se tapaban con una lona durante las noches y ahora incluso tenemos una persiana autom tica con mando
3604183 sta se puede considerar la mejor feria de artesan a de galicia
3604184 tiene un nivel de expositores estupendo y la verdad es que es una de las mejores
3604185 porque si no te mueves no ganas el dinero suficiente para comer
3604186 porque la gente se dedica a pasear y lo ltimo que quiere es tener que cargar con bolsas
3604187 comprar artesan a es comprar originalidad y eso es algo que todav a no se valora lo suficiente
3604188 la gente prefiere gastarse mucho dinero en comprar las mismas marcas e ir todos iguales en lugar de marcar la diferencia con el que tiene al lado
3604189 la gente busca algo que pueda comprar y ponerse en ese mismo momento porque es una manera de mostrar lo que eres por lo que llevas

3604196 es cierto que de alguna manera me ha sorprendido que s lo haya podido hacer tres juegos pero he jugado muy bien a un alto nivel
3604197 no hay nada que explicar me remito a los resultados del ltimo a o
3604198 es el m ximo candidato al oro porque la pista del torneo ol mpico es una de sus superficies predilectas se desenvuelve mejor y ha obtenido mejores resultados

3604200 es todo clase no te regala ning n punto y te hace trabajar muy duro no pude separarme del fondo de la pista me mantuvo all cuando no me entraba el primer saque me presion mucho

3604203 el peor de los miedos es el que nace de la impotencia de poder hacer algo de sentir la impunidad del ofensor

3604214 ahora mismo no se puede decir que hay once mejores que los dem s lotina lo tiene muy dif cil para escoger
3604215 obviamente estar m s cerca de la porter a y poder meter goles me gusta un poco m s pero la posici n de carrilero no es desconocida para m ah inici mi carrera y lo hice todo en m xico en pretemporada lotina habl conmigo y me dijo que me iba a probar ah jugu un par de partidos de lateral en venezuela y no lo hice del todo mal para m es bueno que el entrenador tenga previsto utilizarme tanto de carrilero como un poco m s arriba
3604216 si puedo hacer como coloccini el a o pasado y jugar todos los partidos para m es lo mejor que me puede pasar el m ster sabe lo que puede rendir cada uno y lo que ha rendido cada uno ya nos conoce bien y va a decidir lo mejor para el equipo todos estamos esforz ndonos al m ximo para estar en el once adem s est la opci n de que los dos juguemos juntos
3604217 mi fuerte siempre ha sido m s el ataque atr s padec a un poco en la marca era un carrilero con tendencia a subir mucho adem s me daban libertad para ir al frente y no me conten an mucho recuerda el internacional si al final lotina prefiere que yo me quede un poco m s atr s tratar de aprender porque todav a hay tiempo para mejorar en aspectos defensivos que s que me falta pulir

3604246 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3604247 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3604248 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3604249 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3604250 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3604251 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3604252 its something i have dreamed about for a long time
3604253 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort
3604254 i cant be upset with that and im just moving on to the next heat
3604255 we did it it was perfect its a dream come true
3604256 i want to thank all the people who have been there from the start i have worked so hard i am so happy
3604257 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
3604258 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
3604259 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
3604260 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines
3604261 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head during something that is supposed to be a time of world unity
3604262 movials open source contribution should enable application developers and operators to innovate and create a new range of services and applications exploiting unique features of mobile devices
3604263 virtuallogix is committed to providing developers the opportunity to complement the limo specification with enhanced features and security for deployment on low cost platforms
3604264 with such a variety of industry players cost effectively adopting the limo platform more development resources are being devoted to enhancing the consumer experience
3604265 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3604266 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3604267 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed

3604269 al usar internet la gente cree que todo vale y ocurre lo contrario se persigue cualquier delito
3604270 en las webs hay cosas que han pasado toda la vida como los cr os que se pegan en el colegio la diferencia es que ahora eso se difunde por puro exhibicionismo
3604271 una paliza puede ser un delito de lesiones pero si esa paliza se publica en internet se convierte en un delito de incitaci n a la discriminaci n
3604272 lo primero es proteger su intimidad despu s ya se ver si hay o no delito
3604273 esto es inacabable aunque fu semos mil no llegar amos a todo los delincuentes van a m s por eso es importante que el ciudadano colabore y si ve una agresi n lo denuncie
3604274 esto va por modas la gente ve una conducta en la tele y la imita a ra z de un ataque a una tienda de chinos empezamos a observar agresiones similares en otros locales lo mismo pas con las peleas entre ni os en clase las palizas a mendigos o las carreras de coches
3604275 contra la opini n com n de la gente internet no es an nimo siempre deja un rastro
3604276 un individuo que sepa algo de inform tica puede lograr que los comentarios difamantes sobre una empresa aparezcan en google antes que su web corporativa
3604277 para dejar constancia de que esa injuria estaba ah en esa p gina tal d a y a tal hora
3604278 en youtube el delincuente cuelga la prueba de su delito y eso es una gran ventaja un analista forense puede sacar punta a cualquier cosa si aparece un reloj o un calendario podemos saber en qu pa s se ha grabado el material
3604279 un cl sico el hombre que cuelga fotos provocativas de su antigua pareja en una web de contactos se hizo pasar por ella lo curioso es que siempre se desped a con la expresi n besicos y dejaba un espacio entre la ltima s laba y el signo de interrogaci n comparamos esos mensajes con otros escritos de la mujer y dimos en el clavo
3604280 una vez que el contenido est en la red es dif cil tener la certeza de que ha desaparecido del todo
3604281 el contenido lesivo tarda mucho tiempo en retirarse o que salta a otras p ginas web
3604282 en las grandes empresas todo est profesionalizado y se puede llegar a un acuerdo un blogger particular puede llegar a ser muy combativo
3604283 ellos no supervisan contenidos de modo que no tienen por qu responder de lo que el usuario publique en una p gina
3604284 siempre hay que pasar por el aro del requerimiento judicial
3604285 se produce una colisi n entre el derecho a la tutela judicial efectiva y el derecho a la intimidad todo el mundo est de acuerdo que la protecci n de la intimidad de un delincuente ha de tener un l mite
3604286 amenaz con suicidarse el operador facilit la informaci n y se localiz al chaval
3604287 tenemos una ley de protecci n de datos muy garantista las empresas se ven entre la espada y la pared porque si facilitan datos la agencia de protecci n de datos les rega a
3604288 o al menos que los jueces dispongan de un grupo de expertos que les orienten
3604289 partimos de la base de la buena fe de la gente otra cosa es que yo pida expresamente que se retire mi foto y no se haga eso podr a ser una infracci n al derecho a la imagen
3604290 un equilibrio entre los nuevos usos de internet el derecho y las nuevas tecnolog as
3604291 los j venes poseen herramientas potentes pero no tienen claro qu l mites no deben traspasar y se pueden encontrar con que un d a la polic a les vaya a buscar a casa y ellos no sepan qu han hecho mal es un problema de educaci n en la tecnolog a

3604298 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes
3604299 obviously this isnt something that we absolutely need to do but we stepped up to do it because we think its the right thing to do
3604300 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes
3604301 obviously this isnt something that we absolutely need to do but we stepped up to do it because we think its the right thing to do
3604302 we continue to evaluate our liquidity and our alternatives to improve the balance sheet
3604303 well continue to look at that to make sure that we have adequate liquidity to successfully implement this very significant kind of transformation
3604304 that is our intent but also i dont want to walk away from the fact that theres lots of variables hitting this business every day
3604305 our role is to make sure that were as flexible as we can be to kind of take those things coming at us both the good and the bad
3604306 what we really need to do is tell people that were back in the car business
3604307 les estamos diciendo a los organizadores que pierden la gran oportunidad de que venga m s gente a celebrar los juegos

3604322 wed been looking for my husband for six weeks and this isnt how we wanted it to end at least we can close this
3604323 i got the sense she was trying to tell me where her master was
3604324 last month after the closure of baggette carnicelli inc we hired nearly half of all their admin staff in one week
3604325 and this has really helped our business in many ways and given these people another chance at having meaningful employment in this baseball betting industry
3604326 we also want highly motivated individuals with a background in baseball betting marketing on the internet
3604327 mostly because our internet sales division is booming and we need to explore all marketing opportunities within this important medium
3604328 with the recent boom in the baseball betting market were looking to hire 100 new employees in a range of different jobs
3604329 we believe this time gives us an opportunity to evaluate new hires and decide if we made the right decision in offering them work if they dont pass this temporary evaluation period we offer the job to anyone on our waiting list
3604330 this test is not meant to scare off prospective hirees
3604331 but we want to see how they can apply the skills they have to the real life needs of written communication and critical thinking
3604332 and we realize that as a result we provide new baseball betting business hirees with substantial benefits to stay onboard and grow their career with us
3604333 the most thorough manner to approach baseball betting is through a methodical analysis of trends upward and downward movement and of course changes in the consumer aread

3604348 it is clear that data protection technology is moving faster than human procedure for years data protection has been about more than simply safeguarding valuable information from competitors the rise of terrorism and identity theft has rendered it a matter of national security
3604349 businesses and public sector bodies alike must start viewing on going staff training in data protection as essential to the wider business continuity strategy
3604350 a proactive and considered approach to data management will help to prevent data loss the cost of which is measured not only financially but also in terms of the damage that can be caused to an organisations reputation
3604351 we can expect to see cyber attacks being increasingly used as a weapon alongside physical attacks the benefits of using such methods are that no one is directly physically hurt or killed and it is much harder to pinpoint the source and who is involved
3604352 furthermore cost makes this a really appealing option as it is far less expensive and more simple to instigate than a full scale military attack yet still creates maximum levels of destruction as well as being a critical resource for government ministries the internet also plays an important role in the running of countries and this disruption can damage economies and severely impact the running of services governments need to have in place strategies to prepare for this type of attack and to ensure that resources can be sustained at all times

3604367 because a large chunk of clintons 18 million supporters are upset that the obama campaign has not been more gracious toward senator clinton and has done little to reach out to her former supporters
3604368 more evidence of a candidate faux pas o force one as obamas campaign plane contains a luxurious section for the candidate more reminiscent of an airborne corporate executive suite than a presidential candidate who has to appeal to working class american voters

3604391 the governors island ferry docks in front of the waterfall as the staten island ferry passes
3604392 i took the ferry to governors island and on the way back a thunderstorm came with large gusts of wind the waterfall started blowing onto the island soaking the people waiting for the next ferry
3604393 from brooklyn bridge park you can see the waterfalls at the brooklyn bridge and just north of the manhattan bridge

3604401 a clever line to be sure but if uttered by a sitting president most observers would likely label it a gaffe
3604402 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful

3604405 all the latest new fangled mobile phones functions and their jargons are a bane to old timers like us
3604406 what ever happened to the good old days when all a mobile phone did was to call send and receive messages
3604407 when i got my first mobile phone it was just this plain old simple nokia model
3604408 now i have this samsung phone with a camera in built in it and just a few years back cameras were these bulky objects with film in them
3604409 you know what is worse than the mobile phones themselves
3604410 last week my daughter came up to me and said she wants another phone
3604411 i asked why and she said she cant use her phone because it was too complicated already
3604412 if the studies are proven then definitely it would damage the technology in our eyes
3604413 ultimately we all want technology that is safe and beneficial to mankind and not cancer causing time bombs
3604414 most of them just showcase nice and stylish graphics but not explain the functions
3604415 secondly maybe the mobile companies should include more information about the new technologies in their brochures and catalogues
3604416 they shouldnt expect everyone to be technology savvy especially the older folks
3604417 terms like bluetooth doesnt explain anything neither does java and symbian make the language easier to understand

3604420 we may assume it is god we care for but it may be our own ego
3604421 australians dont have much respect for the music press it runs counter to their culture
3604422 the idea of anyone actually daring to criticise musicians for the sound they make is almost heresy
3604423 especially a leader from the politburo who gave us his opinion this has to change

3604428 mostly an animated three dimensional video that was made over a year it was not actually live footage except the final stage
3604429 looking at it from today the video was a bit brighter than the real fireworks but most viewers thought it was live so we succeeded in the effect we had wanted
3604430 the u s knowingly provoked moscow for years by building up georgias military
3604431 the administration essentially stoked the fires of this conflict by the way we contributed to the building up of georgia and sort of encourage its president to do something like this
3604432 a very powerful group of neoconservative fellow travelers in the democratic party
3604433 trying to turn death near the black sea into political points at home
3604434 mccains language meanwhile was echoed by the architects of the iraq war vice president cheney saying quote russian aggression must not go unanswered fellow neocon william kristol arguing that georgias participation in iraq means quote we owe georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty surely we cannot simply stand by and troubling as the neocon echoes are perhaps more embarrassing two elements of mccains speech one this report from cqpolitics com wherein a wikipedia editor pointing out at least three passages from the mccains speech today that it says most people would consider to have been derived directly from wikipedia
3604435 theres a very powerful group of what i would call neoconservative fellow travelers in the democratic party and a lot of these people were attached to the hillary clinton campaign now the obama campaign is trying to figure out how to take some of these people in and i think theres a risk that senator obama could in the end end up ceding control or shaping the direction of his policy on important issues to some of these elements
3604436 at the same time that russia was mishandled did we not essentially did the administration not essentially stoke the fires of this conflict by the way we have contributed to the building up of georgia and sort of encourage its president to do something like this
3604437 assume we can win anything provided we chant usa usa usa loudly enough
3604438 like it or not a lot of voters assume we can win anything provided we chant usa usa usa loudly enough when your foreign policy positions reinforce that as mccains do throughout not just russia and georgia but throughout the world when its that way versus the message of nuance and complexity that obama touched on today how does obama get that message through in a world in which everybody just breaks in to cheers at the idea okay were going to go were going to fight even though there are no troops to fight with and were not going to take on russia and more than what we could do to them the russians could shut off the oil spigot tomorrow and wed be at 7 gasoline
3604439 honestly the neoconservative position is that you know look what we did in gulf war i look at those smart bombs that only took five minutes when we toppled we did what we wanted to do there
3604440 we owe georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty surely we cannot simply stand by
3604441 im not exactly sure how im going to avenge myself on you but ill think of something really mean
3604442 you know look what we did in gulf war i look at those smart bombs that only took five minutes when we toppled we did what we wanted to do there
3604443 the joseph h kanter family foundation and the ehealth initiative foundation have launched a pilot project for a distributed research network that leverages electronic health records to support the clinical effectiveness of treatments for certain conditions and diseases the partnership for connecting for research on outcomes and effectiveness will work with experts and healthcare stakeholders to explore the organizational technical and policy aspects of using a distributed network to give physicians and patients the best data on treatments for a particular disease

3604445 this scene went on for a long time like half the day and its getting old and i go over to sean and i guess he didnt know that i was wearing a prosthetic i go sean youre such a great actor but you wouldnt do a scene like this if they asked you you wouldnt dive into a pool naked and he said well james if i was built like you i would a couple of weeks later we did this scene where were both dancing and were naked and we both have prosthetic penises he finally put it together that im wearing like the boogie nights prosthetic
3604446 just wanted to let you know that kathi russ and i loved the wizards they worked out perfectly im sure well be using you again
3604447 in a response from players and fans alike pfc decided now was the time to launch an interactive forum where we can get some fun filled discussions and debates going on
3604448 weve noticed that nobody was commenting on the articles on the official website for whatever reason but a forum provides a more interactive discussion and allows the players and fans alike to start discussion it should be a great experience for all
3604449 of course our concern is for him and that he doesnt risk further injury but im sure eddy knows his body well and will know exactly how much he can give or whether or not he needs to rest speaking on behalf of the team i can say were all ecstatic to have him back

3604481 i was going to get what i wanted practice this afternoon but somebody bumped it back in
3604482 the magic of matt stover i guess hes proven over a long period of time that hes one of the premier kickers in the history of the game
3604483 youve got to be able to put yourself in those situations as a kicker
3604484 theres nothing that can replicate that other than a game and thats as close as you can get in fact i think that was worse than kicking a game winner because you dont want to let your guys down
3604485 stover is the man but if he had missed it he would have been the most vilified guy on the team
3604486 he would make it really impossible for me to make did you see the defense they werent rushing very hard were they i knew i had all kinds of time
3604487 it was less than what we thought it was and its getting healthy

3604504 fire eagle is a way for people to take their location to the web
3604505 essentially fire eagle is nothing more nothing less than a store for a users location
3604506 whats more interesting is how it works as a switchboard
3604507 fire eagle solved all the hard problems with location for us
3604508 it makes it easier for bloggers to have correct location information on their blog within their posts being able to geo tag their content
3604509 obviously fire eagle is crucial to the success of what were trying to do
3604510 there are other tools that identify location but none that do it in specifically this way
3604511 the attention to privacy is noteworthy as is the concept behind fire eagle the challenge will be to build user awareness and adoption in the near term

3604538 i have used mango leaves as my theme and every accessory has a mango leaf design in it
3604539 hezbollah also is now far larger and more geographically widespread than ever before
3604540 t hanks to iran hezbollah has far more and better trained operational cadre than al qaeda ever had the hezbollah cadre also is experienced in skullduggery having conducted scores of transnational terrorist operations before al qaeda was even formed iranian state sponsorship provides hezbollah with a support network that al qaeda can only dream of
3604541 i dont think its so simple to say that iran snaps its fingers and hezbollah does what its told hezbollah is a genuine lebanese political organization but ultimately hezbollah is only possible because of iranian support iranian support is key
3604542 if there is going to be an attack against iran even if the united states isnt involved if its just done by israel i think iran will try to attack u s interests in the region if not directly then through their proxies
3604543 they will want to make israel a very very expensive liability for the u s
3604544 resolution 1701 was supposed to limit the actions of hezbollah and prevent it from rearming
3604545 it did not achieve that hezbollah today has rearmed to the point that it is possibly even better equipped than it was before the war the resolution also imposed an embargo on arms shipments to militias in lebanon namely hezbollah which was a huge achievement but that wasnt implemented either
3604546 one of the things mentioned in 1701 is that militants are meant to be disarmed and that measures are meant to be taken against the smuggling of weaponry
3604547 the event that occurred in lebanon serves as a big red light against all involvement of international forces in our conflict
3604548 if there is a lesson to be learned it is that we should not involve foreign forces in our region
3604549 threaten the dominance of the israeli air force over lebanon
3604550 our revolutions main mission is to pave the way for the reappearance of the twelfth imam the mahdi
3604551 in the 33 day war the lebanese hezbollah destroyed at least 50 percent of israel and therefore half the path to the liberation of jerusalem
3604552 subscribers should be in absolutely no doubt about this from irans support for subversion in bahrain through its improving ties with egypt its support for hezbollah in lebanon and the islamist revolutionaries in khartoum to its close strategic alliance with moscow everything has the same ultimate purpose the liberation of jerusalem from under the zionist yoke
3604553 canadas electronic health record projects increased by 12 percent last year and have quadrupled since 2004 according to richard alvarez president and ceo of canada health infoway

3604557 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3604558 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3604559 i was shocked because i figured after i cleared waivers a couple weeks ago nobody wanted me
3604560 its going to take some adjustments i was throwing my blue indians socks in a box and a guy said they wear red socks over there
3604561 this trade is more about clearing room to give some of our other players an opportunity giving paul a chance with a contender and providing us some payroll relief
3604562 it just seemed like the right time to add this kind of stabilizer
3604563 you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it

3604565 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3604566 i wasnt a red sox fan this offseason put it that way

3604576 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3604577 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3604578 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3604579 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

3604583 it hit him good and theres not a lot of meat on those bones
3604584 to say any religion as opposed to any other is the true religion is a flawed statement of spiritual immaturity in itself
3604585 there are simply no words adequate to describe this phenomenon especially as seen by the eye at street level
3604586 economic growth figures chinas purchase of u s treasury bonds and takeover of british companies these cant capture in words what is visible to a person in this city ordinary people who still regard china as backward would be stunned into silence if they laid eyes on beijing which is not as large as the main commercial city shanghai in fact judging by what i see the day china surpasses the u s as the worlds largest economy is much nearer than all the forecasts indicate
3604587 people have a hard time adhering to diets and our research shows that choosing eggs for breakfast can dramatically improve the success of a weight loss plan apparently the increased satiety and energy due to eggs helps people better comply with a reduced calorie diet
3604588 awareness of risk factors for joint symptoms will help both clinicians and patients to anticipate and manage these symptoms and ensure optimum adherence to endocrine treatment
3604589 using an epidural for pain control after a major operation was safe and actually caused a slightly improved survival for patients who received an epidural
3604590 but a lot of people are nervous about having an epidural because it involves a needle and a catheter being placed in their back
3604591 one of the highest priority tasks to avoid contamination of the human food chain with bovine spongiform encephalopathy
3604592 enables the real time detection of possible central nervous system cns tissue contamination on carcasses during slaughter
3604593 small quantities of bovine spinal cord were reliably detected in the presence of raw bovine skeletal muscle fat and vertebrae the research lays the foundation for development of a prototype device allowing real time monitoring of cns tissue contamination on bovine carcasses and meat cuts
3604594 i would like to think these numbers are smaller than women think they are
3604595 remain terrified they are going to relapse i think the message for women is the risk may not be as large as they think

3604598 that was such a tough race i really struggled today getting into that race

3604715 we just dont know what the risk is you just dont know with a lot of people and you have got to be careful dont you
3604716 you wouldnt want even a spectator to get injured let alone the players

3604743 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3604744 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3604745 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3604746 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
3604747 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
3604748 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
3604749 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
3604750 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
3604751 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
3604752 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
3604753 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

3604755 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
3604756 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

3604759 wilson goes and finds out that the claim that iraq was seeking uranium from niger is not accurate
3604760 that wilsons report rather than debunking intelligence about purported uranium sales to iraq as he has said bolstered the case for most intelligence analysts
3604761 rather than the presidents claim of british intelligence that said there was a deal to buy uranium which of course became one of the underpinnings of this administrations argument that we had to go to war with iraq
3604762 the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa
3604763 weve already gotten testimony that in fact that joe wilsons trip to niger was based on forgeries that were so obvious that they were forgeries that officials said it would have only taken a few days for anybody to realize they were forgeries

3604765 the generalizability of the studies is limited few studies employed control groups and most had small samples almost all parents were anglo american middle class and well educated measures for assessing gender roles in young children tend to focus on social behavior and generally are not accurate psychological instruments therefore it is impossible to make large scale generalizations that would be applicable to all children

3604774 people usually know when they have been bitten by a bat
3604775 however bats have small teeth that may leave marks not easily

3604789 solar flares are pieces of the sun which leap into space discharging radiation and strong electrical currents that travel outward into space they often fall back to the surface of the sun sometimes a very strong flare called a coronal mass ejection cme actually leaves the sun and this deadly mass shoots out from the sun towards the planets like a bullet they usually dont hit anything but they occasionally hit a planet like earth most flares are small but even a small flares can be dangerous in 1989 a flare hit the north american continent and fried electric lines zapped power grids in the us and canada and created large power blackouts flares can also effect our moods and physical health in theory a large flare impacting the earth could zap the ionosphere and irradiate the surface killing every living organism that it touched
3604790 because of the large uncertainty we have in the radiative forcing of aerosols there is a corresponding large uncertainty in the degree of radiative forcing overall

3604832 we have a real opportunity on our hand over the next couple of years to show people that we have world class cars that were bringing here to the u s
3604833 when those start stabilizing it has a positive effect on consumer sentiment but it also has a positive effect in the banking community because they know that their asset base theyre not going to have to write it down the next quarter
3604834 people are speaking out and expressing their feelings on what they expect of a district attorney it was not so much about me as much as what the community wants
3604835 im very pleased he will have the opportunity to lead a premier district attorneys office or what i expect to be a premier district attorneys office
3604836 he gave me his heart and soul the least i could do is give back
3604837 nothing is more pleasurable as a patriotic american than to assist in getting a bad bureaucrat out of office
3604838 mr newsome thought he was above the law the rest of us are expected to follow
3604839 why build a campaign on criminal justice issues when you can get the media to focus on beer and football
3604840 i was in this race because the community spoke out
3604841 thats why the petition process is so important it means the man on the street can have his input
3604842 its not often you get to meet the guys that you watch week in week out
3604843 you would do anything for them as far as supporting is concerned
3604844 were slightly different from the rugby crowd were more high energy its fun its high excitement and energetic this type of activity encapsulates how we see ourselves
3604845 ich freue mich dass herr tiefensee endlich in deutschland angekommen ist
3604846 wir brauchen eine gesamtdeutsche regionalpolitik die fast 20 jahre nach dem mauerfall die ost oder westdeutsche brille abnimmt
3604847 wenn bundesminister tiefensee jetzt offensichtlich auch sein herz f r die probleme von strukturschw cheren gebieten in westdeutschland entdeckt hat klingt uns das wie musik in den ohren sicher wird tiefensee seine ank ndigungen bald mit einem kr ftigen finanzf rderkonzept des bundes untermauern
3604848 bremen k mpft in der f deralismuskommission f r eine gesicherte finanzielle zukunft dass sich ein bundesminister in dieser weise zu bremerhaven u erst ist eine wichtige aussage
3604849 es ist unstrittig dass die zuk nftige f rderung sich an wirtschaftlichen notwendigkeiten von regionen und nicht mehr nach himmelsrichtungen orientieren wird
3604850 nach auslaufen des solidarpakt ii wird und soll es keine sonderregelung f r den osten mehr geben
3604851 its a threat i hope people take this for real
3604852 people should treat this as a moderate risk for the west nile virus
3604853 to our knowledge there are no leaks in the tanks
3604854 we would have discovered leaks with abnormal filling of the tanks which has not occurred over the years
3604855 class sizes will be monitored and adjustments will be made if needed
3604856 they will look for the least expensive way to buy
3604857 so if that means using the tax holiday thats what theyre going to do
3604858 we think both consumers and main street massachusetts could really use this right now because both are tapped out
3604859 i dont think you will find a lot of people making impulse purchases this time around
3604860 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3604861 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3604862 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3604863 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3604864 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3604865 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3604866 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3604867 as a writer and as an actor and as an enthusiast i think he epitomized those things in theater and entertainment that are good
3604868 company is the show that put him on the map
3604869 its one of the most important musicals of its era
3604870 company tells us more about the cynicism of urban america in the 1970s than all the sociological tracts ever written it is a work of considerable wisdom
3604871 when and where and all the details associated with that were not worked out but that was the consensus of the group
3604872 if that works i think everybody will be happy but recall has not been taken off the table
3604873 theres a fourth option that they dont have on their list and that fourth option is to look at changing the form of government that we have
3604874 i think that after sitting in the seat for 16 months that this form of government is fundamentally flawed
3604875 it may be time for us to think about where we want to go
3604876 daf r sind die inhaltlichen differenzen auf bundesebene einfach zu gro
3604877 never in my life could i imagine seeing this in new england
3604878 it looked like hurricane katrina there was mud everywhere the refrigerator was down everything was down
3604879 it was unbelievable the water went up to the box spring on our bed
3604880 were throwing everything out now and we dont have any insurance
3604881 he dropped everything and he was here sitting with us making us feel good
3604882 were going to go 24 7 till we get this done
3604883 we have 70 air movers and 25 industrial size dehumidifiers out there and were now playing musical chairs with equipment
3604884 i havent seen it this bad since hurricane bob in 91 our guys were out there till 10 last night and it will be the same tonight
3604885 we lost some training manuals and paper anything that was on the floor but no equipment
3604886 we hope to get back in next week because we have orientation and training scheduled
3604887 you could have taken a canoe up and down rivet street
3604888 the water came right through the front door i didnt have my fishing boots with me so i went home
3604889 everything got wet 50 feet into the store we had 8 inches in here
3604890 it happened so fast in 26 years i have never seen anything like this i was thinking of noahs flood i called my husband but he couldnt even get down here because of the water
3604891 we stood down from our emergency management plan this morning
3604892 we had sandbags and pumps ready in case we got more rain overnight monday but now we are just cleaning up we have a company here now cleaning and sanitizing the affected areas
3604893 if you have a sump pump in your home you can get a sump pump clause in your policy but even that generally has a 2 000 cap
3604894 this first patent secures the intellectual property on our approach to treat resistant bacteria using new chemistry against an established antibacterial target
3604895 we believe this technology holds promise for the treatment of both gram positive and gram negative bacterial infections
3604896 it will unload the work of the heart providing time and options when you are in the middle of high risk events
3604897 this new device can be inserted through a catheter similar to a routine heart catheterization it allows the heart to rest and in some cases recover
3604898 it is another example of forward thinking technology and research brought to the bedside
3604899 wake forest baptist continues to be on the forefront of techniques and cutting edge therapies that provide options for patient care
3604900 it indicates that early eating patterns have effects that persist over time regardless of later changes in diet
3604901 so it is very important for children to eat a well balanced diet from an early age if they are to get the best out of their education
3604902 its sad to see what happened but weve still got to keep on going
3604903 ive been blessed with what has been given to me you feel good by doing good for other people who are in need thats what makes the world go round
3604904 animals that live in the north atlantic are more influenced by humans than any other population
3604905 when you live in real estate where there are ships running through your living room and fishing gear in your dining room you are going to die
3604906 there it is a relatively pristine environment in terms of human activities
3604907 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3604908 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3604909 youve got prosecutors and media overreacting to everything this man does
3604910 we see enormous growth potential in the future and have solid strategies in place to support our goals
3604911 the impact of department stores tightening inventory levels gives us just as much opportunity
3604912 it helps maintain a wider pricing gap between us and the department stores and can increase average ticket
3604913 sometimes the cause and effect is difficult to define its a self perpetuating vicious circle going on where oil falls strengthens the dollar then the strengthening dollar forces oil down more
3604914 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3604915 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3604916 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college
3604917 it is simply unacceptable for top government officials to be unaccountable for such a gross abuse of their power
3604918 the decision on charging anyone is still open pending the investigation
3604919 a lot of people saw it we have a good idea what happened but we want to confirm it with any other eyewitnesses
3604920 is vulnerable to adversaries who seek information about our nations homeland defense programs classified or unclassified
3604921 any real or possible contacts with foreign intelligence services terrorists or foreign criminal enterprises
3604922 he looked at all the other forces but that didnt look like a challenge for him
3604923 he loved his job and he loved what he was doing
3604924 he helped me through things and i helped him he always used to say his dad was his hero but hes our hero
3604925 he had lots of dreams but the only one he wanted was to make sure that child grew up to be the best
3604926 hopefully next year ill be down there with you guys have a couple of beers celebrate love you guys
3604927 would not be in the best interest of the community
3604928 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3604929 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3604930 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3604931 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3604932 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3604933 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3604934 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3604935 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3604936 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3604937 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3604938 vitamin d and health in the 21st century an update
3604939 given recent findings its easy to see why people are so enthusiastic about the potential power of vitamin d but we must recognize the limitations of any study and exercise caution when making broad public health recommendations
3604940 this is a very complex set of issues and there is still a lot we dont know about how vitamin d levels affect health especially across different age groups and ethnic populations
3604941 its tempting to think that an essential nutrient is safe at any level that if some is good more is better
3604942 weve learned that this isnt always true and there are potential harms associated with high levels of many nutrients
3604943 voraussetzung ist jedoch dass es bei den von der bundesregierung prognostizierten wirtschaftlichen rahmenbedingungen bleibt
3604944 einige politiker mit der gleichen leidenschaft auch f r beitragssenkungen in anderen sozialversicherungszweigen k mpfen w rden
3604945 wenn ein hartz iv empf nger mit einem minijob zus tzlich 400 eur verdient von diesem verdienst aber 240 eur abgezogen bekommt kann ich verstehen dass er dies als ungerecht empfindet und klagt
3604946 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes
3604947 obviously this isnt something that we absolutely need to do but we stepped up to do it because we think its the right thing to do
3604948 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3604949 appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
3604950 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3604951 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3604952 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3604953 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3604954 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong
3604955 but i just couldnt bring myself to pull the lever and vote for you
3604956 because i dont think theres a lot of stigma in saying youre voting for john mccain
3604957 do you want to vote for the white guy or the black guy
3604958 the real frailty of our polls is that we get very high refusal rates and we survive because the people who we interview are like the people who we dont interview on most things
3604959 and to be honest with you this is something every pollster i know is concerned about
3604960 it was clear that people were having the first opportunity to vote for an african american and there was uncertainty
3604961 you know is he going to be fair is he just going to look out for his own people and who are his own people i think weve come a great distance from that ive seen the progress
3604962 racial attitudes and stereotypes that people in many cases are not aware they have
3604963 i dont think anyone is correct or incorrect including me
3604964 to get to the heart of that youd have to do the kinds of research that havent been done
3604965 i wouldnt want to be barack obama and up two points going into election day
3604966 my guess is that the obama campaign understands that and they know its not enough to be ahead
3604967 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
3604968 there is accountability through the contract and to the contracting officer
3604969 the more severe their slowdown the greater the likelihood that it will begin to cool the boom in exports
3604970 the weak dollar has become a major driver of economic growth
3604971 we see no reason why these agreements should not be done in september
3604972 there is no reason why we should be procrastinating this is important for our economy and for jobs
3604973 provided an important reminder of the role that exports play in our economy
3604974 fire eagle is a way for people to take their location to the web
3604975 essentially fire eagle is nothing more nothing less than a store for a users location
3604976 whats more interesting is how it works as a switchboard
3604977 fire eagle solved all the hard problems with location for us
3604978 it makes it easier for bloggers to have correct location information on their blog within their posts being able to geo tag their content
3604979 obviously fire eagle is crucial to the success of what were trying to do
3604980 there are other tools that identify location but none that do it in specifically this way
3604981 the attention to privacy is noteworthy as is the concept behind fire eagle the challenge will be to build user awareness and adoption in the near term
3604982 se il tuo fratello commette una colpa va e ammoniscilo fra te e lui solo se ti ascolter avrai guadagnato il tuo fratello se non ti ascolter prendi con te una o due persone perch ogni cosa sia risolta sulla parola di due o tre testimoni se poi non ascolter neppure costoro dillo allassemblea e se non ascolter neanche lassemblea sia per te come un pagano e un pubblicano in verit vi dico tutto quello che legherete sopra la terra sar legato anche in cielo e tutto quello che scioglierete sopra la terra sar sciolto anche in cielo in verit vi dico ancora se due di voi sopra la terra si accorderanno per domandare qualunque cosa il padre mio che nei cieli ve la conceder perch dove sono due o tre riuniti nel mio nome io sono in mezzo a loro
3604983 io sono con voi tutti i giorni fino alla fine del tempo
3604984 non mi stupirei che questo caro figliuolo divenisse un giorno una gloria del nostro istituto
3604985 are you sure its ok to send us alone i mean were just kids
3604986 yes i am certain its ok i am confidant that you two can make it back to the room safely
3604987 ill come back to check on you in 30 minutes when my meeting is over
3604988 i am going to do this im ready to go for it
3604989 i did it for six days so what made that work

3604992 i dont know about soul mates but i do know that my spouse and i are laugh mates
3604993 the wild world is becoming so remote to children that they miss out
3604994 why do so many young adults 18 to 22 leave the church and what will it take to bring them back
3604995 two and a half years ago lifeway worship director mike harland came into my office and talked about a plan and a vision of creating a new hymnal and a new worship project that would help churches craft their worship experiences i sensed that it was truly a god thing today we have reason to celebrate gods goodness with the dedication of this new hymnal
3604996 lets us remember the past observe the present and commit to the future
3604997 when i saw the words to that song the music came to me immediately
3604998 im honored and blessed to have been able to be involved with writing and composing that song with ragan courtney
3604999 its been such an honor to be involved and our thanks to all whove worked on this whole project its our goal to write hymns with two purposes to honor god and to bring generations together through singing these songs of worship
3605000 if the recognition of this project only brings honor and attention to us its not what we hoped

3605007 the 529 college savings plans are the best thing going when saving for your kids college education
3605008 many families dont understand all of the aid and scholarship opportunities that are available
3605009 government money is awarded on a first come first served basis and a lot of scholarships are based on how you fill out that fafsa form
3605010 sixty five percent of people who fill out the fafsa fill it out incorrectly so it gets sent back if applicants dont fix it they may get reduced or no aid
3605011 you should not sacrifice your retirement to pay for your childs education
3605012 although saving enough for a good college education is essential parents dont need to feel ashamed for saving for their retirement its ok for students to attend well reputed less expensive colleges
3605013 children should work and help contribute to their college costs
3605014 show children the value of money and that money is earned teach children about the proper use of money and the value of a dollar
3605015 im just as strong as i was when i played football

3605028 just want assurance that they are in a healthy relationship that they can make it when the storms of life hit them and that they have the skills necessary to do what is healthy
3605029 my pastor never really probed in our relationship to discover how healthy we were emotionally or spiritually or relationally
3605030 that counselor really helped us examine our relationship to make sure we were approaching marriage for healthy reasons
3605031 if youre with someone and trying to decide if your problems should keep you apart or if you should try to work through them then why not get counseling before you get engaged
3605032 once the engagement ring sits on a womans finger the couple generally loses most of its objectivity about the relationship
3605033 couples are a lot more willing to stop and deal with a problem prior to engagement because they havent made that public commitment to friends and family
3605034 we couldnt figure out why we fought so much and still wanted to be together
3605035 we said lets go ahead and do it now because we dont want to get engaged get all excited get everyone else all excited and then break it off
3605036 the counselor was able to help us appreciate where each other was coming from and allow us to respect each other rather than just saying youre wrong
3605037 couples tend to remember how to apply the tools of conflict resolution
3605038 values that are sympathetic to your concerns at the spiritual end of your relationship
3605039 they the therapists have got to spend some time figuring you out just because theyre therapists does not mean they can just meet you and know
3605040 doing everything they couples know to do to ensure that this is going to be a happy relationship
3605041 in the war on terrorism intelligence has replaced the cold wars tanks and fighter planes as the primary weapon against an unseen enemy
3605042 could inflict far more damage to national security than soviet spies
3605043 you can imagine a person being able to go from point a to point b in all kinds of crazy ways but people mostly choose to walk
3605044 walking is the least energy consuming at slow speeds and running is the least energy consuming at fast speeds
3605045 so walkings the gait that people use where theres at least one foot on the ground where your body moves approximately in a sequence of circular arcs
3605046 and as far as we can tell this thing looks would look something like a tired run something like like that
3605047 so weve gone from maybe one fifth or one sixth of the worlds population participating to where we now have a huge pool of people in the olympic games
3605048 at some level weve reached a physiological plateau in general the champions of today dont have dramatically better treadmill times as compared to elite athletes of earlier generations what i think we are seeing is a small effect due to better racetracks shoes and improved sports medicine and people are participating longer so you have more competitive depth which leads to better races and races designed to set world records
3605049 the lactate threshold is highly related to how people perform in an event like the 10 000 meter race marathons or a bicycle time trial the physiology and biochemistry behind it is complex and controversial but its a good marker of when the regulatory and physiological control systems of the body are in balance
3605050 the first misperception is that somehow people dont have enough oxygen when they are making lactic acid that certainly can be true because lactic acid can come from a lack of oxygen but under most circumstances the athletes have plenty of oxygen and there is plenty of oxygen in the muscle
3605051 the second misnomer is that lactic acid hangs around in your muscle for long periods of time you may hear things like this individual is sore or not performing as well today because they have a lot of lactic acid in their muscle from yesterdays event well you can have very high levels of lactic acid in muscle but its gone 15 to 30 minutes after exercise so lactic acid doesnt hang around a long time
3605052 breathing oxygen on the sidelines really doesnt help theres no evidence that it works
3605053 they all have big engines and high lactate thresholds because theyve been training hard for a long time their muscles have adapted to run very fast without releasing a lot of lactic acid
3605054 in cycling for example when lance armstrong came back from cancer he became much more efficient he could generate more power per given oxygen update that is the same as a runner being able to generate more speed per given power when you look at this small pool of elite athletes of runners cyclists and rowers all of them have a high vo2 all have a large engine and all of them have skeletal muscles that are designed not to produce a lot of lactic acid so the question then becomes who is the most efficient
3605055 your vo2 max typically starts to decline in your 30s but a highly trained athlete can delay that decline until they are in their later 30s or even early 40s an average sedentary person loses about 10 percent per decade starting at about age 30 but for someone who is able to continue to train very hard into their 40s and 50s they only lose about half that much primarily due to the fact they continue to train hard
3605056 as scientists search for genes and the determinants of performance they keep drawing a blank there have been no major gene discoveries saying that this gene really confers championship status or the potential for championship status of one person
3605057 it can be very deceptive to say that since the kenyans and perhaps ethiopians are dominating distance running it must be genetic in fact there have been periods of time when other cultures have dominated distance running before world war ii the finns dominated distance running after world war ii the eastern europeans dominated distance running they were just as dominant as the kenyans are now
3605058 i think what the kenyans and ethiopians have shown is the value of altitude training they are physically active their entire lives they live at high altitude they run to and from school they play soccer after school all at high altitude 6 000 to 8 000 feet there are not a lot of economic opportunities so there is a tremendous incentive for people to run and train hard
3605059 so what the kenyans have added is altitude training hard training and large numbers of highly motivated people but their physiological data is not dramatically different from other people i think you can make the same argument for the eastern europeans after world war ii if you were a pretty good athlete the government offered you and your family incentives to train in an otherwise bleak economic landscape
3605060 one of the sad things in last 30 to 40 years of sport has been the emergence of the pharmacological arms race or doping
3605061 researchers have started to test the tests and have raised questions about the accuracy of the existing tests theyve shown that if you dont do the test soon after people take the drug it may be very difficult to detect especially if epo is take in low doses
3605062 remember while its fun to watch sports and while we will all be tempted to sit in front of the tv to watch the olympics the really important thing is to get out and move one hundred and fifty minutes of physical activity a week is really the most powerful medicine anybody can prescribe no matter what your level of fitness even if its just walking try to be as physically active as you possibly can because thats the way to be a healthy old person and get more out of life

3605085 well see if they make any recommendations and what they may relate to as far as the connector
3605086 its certainly a very unfortunate and sad incident and any recommendations will certainly be considered by the department
3605087 we were early into the ground with our first beans we had a good crop of peas now its been too hot too dry too wet all in all things are growing well
3605088 the watermelon really liked all that early sun we had and theyre just starting to ripen up
3605089 its unusual to have them here in early august usually its later this month or even early september
3605090 if we get sun now well be alright but if this rain keeps up thats when you start losing things with fungus and rot in the fields
3605091 it was a bad crisis for the world it required tough words but also a smart approach to call on the international community to step in and im very very happy that the senators request for a ceasefire has been complied with by president medvedev
3605092 were very concerned we might have another collision in that area
3605093 verwurzelung in den grundlegenden amerikanischen werten und der kultur ist allenfalls begrenzt
3605094 die rechte wei dass obama allenfalls gegen attila den hunnenk nig eine wahlchance h tte
3605095 clinton begr ndete ihre kandidatur mit ihrer f hrungsst rke
3605096 in wahrheit ist sie nie wie eine chefin aufgetreten und ihre berater wurden zu ihrer achillesferse
3605097 metido en el problema y no sabe c mo salir
3605098 da la impresi n de que el ejecutivo est absolutamente a la deriva y desbordado
3605099 una cosa son las causas leg timas o ileg timas para entrar en una guerra y otra la manera de conducirla
3605100 han violentado el orden internacional en todas sus dimensiones al lanzarse a este conflicto
3605101 le ha costado a la alianza una derrota virtual en un conflicto en el que no ha participado y sa era una de las consecuencias que putin buscaba y que intentar rentabilizar en el futuro
3605102 tom una de las peores decisiones al intentar resolver por la fuerza un problema que su pa s arrastra de 1991 sin tener en cuenta que lo m s probable era que rusia con sus peores modos
3605103 con un nivel de violencia que una naci n tan peque a como la suya no ten a ninguna oportunidad de resistir
3605104 despu s de esta guerra tan corta como intensa resulta dif cil saber si los aliados optar n por acelerar la aproximaci n a la otan de georgia
3605105 la mayor parte de la gesti n de las consecuencias de esta crisis caer en efecto del lado de la alianza atl ntica y de la uni n europea porque las naciones unidas han vuelto a estancarse en sus propias contradicciones
3605106 no admiten dudas en cuanto a que constituyen un triunfo indudable de la fuerza de los hechos
3605107 hace imposible una interpretaci n diferente de los hechos ni la otan ha ido m s all de las palabras ni estados unidos de las declaraciones y la ayuda log stica los soldados georgianos en iraq en un conflicto cuyo desenlace corresponde fijar a rusia de acuerdo con la l gica que se aplican a s mismas las grandes potencias
3605108 con su intervenci n en georgia rusia ha marcado la l nea roja en su zona de influencia que ni europa ni estados unidos deben traspasar y lo ha hecho contundentemente
3605109 no hay duda que la actitud de estados unidos y de los pa ses europeos ha sido la correcta la de apostar por la diplomacia porque cualquier otra reacci n habr a abocado al mundo a un conflicto de incalculables consecuencias pero eso mismo ha marcado los l mites de la influencia occidental sobre rusia
3605110 de momento mosc ha ganado claramente la batalla b lica y lleva mucha ventaja en la diplom tica con su pol tica de hechos consumados
3605111 en cualquier caso el c ucaso necesita di logo y entendimiento sin posiciones de fuerza de por medio para que la herida no se cierre en falso y la amenaza de guerra no planee sobre la zona
3605112 el deseable encauzamiento de un conflicto que jam s deber a haber rebasado el terreno de la diplomacia no puede difuminar la condena que merecen la temeraria incursi n del ej rcito georgiano en osetia del sur ni la desmedida respuesta del kremlin
3605113 esto va en serio no es teatro esta parece ser la consigna que sigue el psc sus aliados en el govern de la generalitat y ciu para advertir al psoe y al gobierno de jos luis rodr guez zapatero de que no se ceder un pice en la reivindicaci n de que se aplique en su totalidad el nuevo estatut y en particular las normas que regulan otro modelo de financiaci n de la generalitat
3605114 pero la escalada verbal y el paso a la acci n con la que jalea ciu tienen un l mite la reclamaci n de la generalitat es justa en su conjunto pero el oponente siempre tiene una parte de la raz n y es de sabios escuchar y negociar las discrepancias con el manique smo de buenos y malos nunca sale nada bueno
3605115 la compleja negociaci n sobre el nuevo modelo de financiaci n auton mica la brecha abierta con la generalitat catalana por el desarrollo del estatut y el eventual efecto de ambos factores sobre la aprobaci n de los presupuestos del estado anticipan un curso pol tico muy incierto para el gobierno de zapatero urgido adem s por las consecuencias de la crisis econ mica
3605116 estamos ante una clara burla a la justicia de alguien que se aprovecha de la magnanimidad del sistema para seguir delinquiendo
3605117 porque parece evidente que quien est lo bastante enfermo como para no ingresar en prisi n tampoco ha de tener fuerza para cometer delitos
3605118 el hecho de que zigor goikoetxea siga delinquiendo es la prueba de que no hay motivos reales para que eluda la c rcel
3605119 la mejor defensa que el estado de derecho puede dar a los dem cratas que se juegan la vida en el pa s vasco y el mensaje m s demoledor que puede transmitir a los violentos es que garantiza que no hay resquicios para la impunidad

3605122 el contexto de crisis y la necesidad de control en los fondos p blicos tambi n deber an estar presentes en estas dadivosas giras de la vicepresidenta

3605144 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3605145 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3605146 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3605147 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3605148 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3605149 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3605150 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting

3605152 anybody who has bought a property at one of these sites is being kept up to date but this is an issue between us and the buyer the reason is the downturn in the housing market

3605154 interest in the quayside apartments is already huge and its easy to see why you just cant beat the location it is superb
3605155 this is the latest but i fear not the last such blow to the cardiff economy many warned there were too many flats being built in the bay

3605323 i feel its insulting to women to remove a vulva because of somebodys attitude
3605324 some of these so called civic leaders are a little immature themselves looking at the female creative power i guess its a very deep rooted ancient fear that men have women are able to reproduce

3605334 i love the house because it is terribly conveniently placed and it has enough room so that when my children come home and grandchildren there is room for them
3605335 however there is a lot of upkeep and overheads it is an old queenslander so it does require the replacing of the deck and painting and that kind of thing
3605336 in about 12 months time i think it might be time that i have to sell my house to get some money
3605337 i think about it all the time but everytime i think about putting it on the market i cant do it
3605338 emotionally i am just very attached there are very happy memories in this house
3605339 in the average rich country if you like when people retire their income falls to a level of about two thirds of their previous income
3605340 in australia on the other hand the drop is down to about 50 per cent the flip side however is that the australian elderly have much higher rates of home ownership than the elderly in most other countries
3605341 we have around 85 per cent of elderly owning their own home compared to rates under 75 per cent or down in the sixties for countries like the uk
3605342 making sure that reverse mortgages work and they are not too expensive covering the risks associated with them for example the risk of living too long and running out of money and making it easier to trade down your house
3605343 possibly reducing stamp duty for people in that older people for example
3605344 youve had people enter into a reverse mortgage or some kind of mortgage based on a value now and with no repayments reverse mortgages are about no repayments being made until the property is sold or it is taken out of the estate at the point of death
3605345 it may well expose people who are involved in reverse mortgage for a fair period of time to having no interest left in their property when they most need it
3605346 the situation for older australians has deteriorated since the last budget and the report that the government handed down the pensions review discussion paper only reinforces the fact that particularly the single aged pension is inadequate and that older australians reliant on the single aged pension are doing it very very tough
3605347 i think the government needs to increase the pension i had some superannuation but not a lot because i had to work part time because my children were small when i was widowed
3605348 there are a lot of people like me at my age who are in that situation where they werent able to establish a good superannuation pension

3605355 the photo of comparable sale number 3 is from mls the house was not visible or barely visible from the street a copy of the appraisers photo of the property is on file if needed

3605358 the subject of a real property appraisal is not limited to all of the physical parts of an identified parcel or tract of real estate the subject of a real property appraisal can be a full or fractional ownership interest in all or any part of an improved or unimproved parcel or tract of identified real estate for example the subject of a real property appraisal could be a half interest in the land part of the land the improvements on or to the land or some other configuration within a parcel or tract of identified real estate
3605359 an appraiser is not required to value the whole when the subject of the appraisal is a fractional interest a physical segment or a partial holding

3605364 weve actually helped to develop some organic standards that are specific to the pacific and thats going to be launched very soon in september in samoa through the secretariat of the pacific community weve been very much a part of that because we see our future in the pacific will be in agriculture because agriculture is really our most sustainable source of anything to do economically
3605365 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3605366 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3605367 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3605368 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3605369 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3605373 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3605374 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3605375 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3605376 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3605377 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3605378 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3605379 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3605380 a couple of days ago somebody asked me that and that was the first id heard about it its incredibly flattering to be in a rumour

3605390 i told him to get over it and move on because at least now we can go on holiday early that went down like a lead balloon

3605414 there is very little evidence to support the idea that a punitive approach that targets parents is going to increase school attendance especially when were talking about the profile of many aboriginal communities where there isnt enough money being spent on providing basic education services or infrastructure
3605415 by simply saying were going to punish the parents it takes responsibility away from the government to provide enough teachers enough funding to support education services to all of the students in the community
3605416 less than half the funding going towards the education of an aboriginal child compared to a non aboriginal child
3605417 at last a thorough authoritative source for work in the cognitive sciences take the most important topics in the study of cognition ask the worlds top authorities to summarize the state of the art and you have it the mit encyclopedia i have already used it to learn to browse to inform to teach and to update my own understanding it doesnt matter which end you seek the book will frequently be in use
3605418 the cognitive sciences emerged in recognition of the fact that scholars and scientists in many different fields shared common problems and needed to collaborate now at last the mit encyclopedia of the cognitive sciences has provided a forum large enough for that interaction to occur a forum that will not only facilitate cooperation but will educate a new generation of cognitive scientists

3605454 to me were a pitching defense oriented team that relies on just enough hitting
3605455 thats the way i view my team so its important for us to play good defense and you can see that cardinals series we pitched well and we played very well defensively and we won two out of three games i think thats a little microcosm of our season
3605456 you look at our team and you look at where weve scored the most runs in the national league
3605457 but consistently theres a gap between a lot of scoring and too little scoring so we need to play good defense and we need to get good pitching and thats our formula
3605458 but i do know that for us the right formula is good solid pitching good solid defense and timely hitting
3605459 we get into these swings where we swing the bats really really well and put some runs on the board and make it look relatively comfortable and then we get into these other streaks where everythings a struggle because we dont score enough runs but one thing is for sure your defense should be constant and one of the things that i really like about this team is we started off rather slowly and were picking up steam as far as plays are concerned
3605460 he didnt throw too many breaking balls the other day kerry basically feels that hes ready you know what he probably is but i think we give him one more tightener and then we put him back into the closers role

3605464 they wanted to take away abkhazia and south ossetia they needed to trample all over the country russias troops destroyed everything we managed to build these years schools hospitals kindergartens putin and his cronies told us bombs are everything youll see

3605763 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3605764 the russians are killing many people in the villages even old women and the west doesnt want to hear their screams
3605765 if big countries like america and england said something more strongly then they may stop but russia is showing its muscles and we are all being forced to bow before it
3605766 aan de zijkant van je hersenen zit het gebied dat de motoriek aanstuurt het aansturingsgebied voor je gezicht en tong is het grootst naast het gebied voor de handen omdat het zo groot is wordt het al snel geactiveerd ook als je andere lichaamsdelen gebruikt

3605773 maybe i should play a bit more against them but our overall play was good we kept the ball speed up and had a good balance with our forwards
3605774 if we maintain what we did it will work for us
3605775 we did not give away too many penalty corners and now have two days to recover and see what we can work on
3605776 i did not feel good that day because of the bruised hip but physical therapy has done a lot of good i am ready for more action
3605777 when you concede 15 goals in two matches its a tough battle to keep your morale up
3605778 we have to take in the good and work out the bad
3605779 we have played the two strongest teams in our pool so hopefully it should get easier now
3605780 kijk er zitten hier mensen die denken dat ze napoleon zijn en zo kun jij denken dat jij bij de krant werkt

3605796 we have five teams with ranging age levels including two high school teams one with our more experienced players and the other team with newer players
3605797 we all worked well together a lot of us have been playing together for over five years this season was a lot of fun it was great to beat burlingame and win league again
3605798 jessica has been with us for six years and has done a great job with this group of girls

3605817 prova disso o trabalho que permitiu confiscar uma grande quantidade de explosivos nos ltimos dias e evitar que este tipo de a o se realize
3605818 there are a lot of patients out there who are taking statins who could save a lot of money by splitting a larger tablet or perhaps even moving to a lower cost statin and splitting a larger tablet of that statin and save even more money
3605819 it is something we want to get a better control of
3605820 if everyone who wanted a volt could get one that would be the dream
3605821 i dont know if there is any other vehicle or any other technology that has generated this kind of interest because of the state of the market and gas prices
3605822 its a gorgeous place and it makes me think about all of the history thats taken place there
3605823 people were jumping up and shouting vote vote it was crazy
3605824 these are the same tracks that go behind city hall and through the heart of the metropolitan area
3605825 its a completely different side you lose a few games and you win some but after all you want to go out there you want to do and its not as if your players are not putting in the effort so we look to go out there and do our best what we can and we will try to give our best shot and we will try to perform according to our potential
3605826 president medvedev stated that he has halted the offensive but reports indicate that russian military forces have continued attacks in some areas and the situation remains fluid and dangerous
3605827 in the face of this threat the leaders of poland estonia lithuania ukraine and latvia you know theres a common thread there amongst them they all suffered under soviet domination theyve all announced that theyll travel to the region and the french president is in moscow in an attempt to help resolve the crisis
3605828 this is the situation in georgia as we meet here this morning
3605829 my friends we learned at great cost the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked
3605830 incorporating the linksys small business channel partner program services and assets into the award winning cisco channel partner program this process includes bringing the linksys business series products into the cisco smb portfolio and providing cisco channel partners with access to a more diverse solution set to allow for more choice and increased revenue potential
3605831 we know that families in some communities still use the corner shop on a daily basis for their food and other household goods
3605832 it is therefore essential we take healthy eating options to these stores and reach those families who are at the greatest risk of poor health due to a poor diet
3605833 working together we can bring not only the access but also the messages about healthy choices to the consumers that need it most
3605834 we fully support the drive to encourage healthy eating through improving access to fruit and veg
3605835 but just providing healthy food options isnt enough to change the way people eat to be successful this initiative needs to be joined up with other local programmes which can educate and empower people to make healthy choices
3605836 obesity is a complex problem it will take long term sustained investment to change the habits of the next generation
3605837 die emanzipation ist erst dann vollendet wenn auch einmal eine total unf hige frau in eine verantwortliche position aufger ckt ist
3605838 ich bin gegen die emanzipation durch emanzipation verliert die frau ihre weiblichkeit was kann einer frau schlimmeres passieren
3605839 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3605840 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3605841 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3605842 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3605843 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation
3605844 have taken profits as theyve seen demand destruction in the u s and theyre seeing it spread a little into europe
3605845 the question is where will the number level off at for china in the next few months
3605846 china is an enormous driver for the price of oil along with india brazil and the middle east
3605847 i think a drop of 20 percent is a bit over done
3605848 weve fallen too far too fast i expect the market to sit between 110 and 120 in the short term
3605849 sebelum ni pun bro masa zaman tun ader jugak masalah macam macam masalah tapi bro tindakan tun takder pun yang bagi masalah kat rakyat tanggung
3605850 oh alangkah buruknya aku ini sebagai pemimpin jika aku memakan bahagiannya yang baik lalu aku berikan rakyat makan yang sisa
3605851 ha bro macam tu la dia sepatutnya aper yang jadi sekarang pemimpin kita ajar kita macam mana nak berjimat macam macam la kita dah takder aper nak jimatkan dah
3605852 diaorang pemimpin boleh la cakap macam tu diaorang berjalan ader ke pakai duit diorang macam macam elaun diorang ader sampai ader yang elaun tu pun diorang tak pakai sebab duit diorang dah banyak tak payah la amik duit elaun tu diorang amik cara lain macam macam cara diorang boleh dapat duit bila dah ader kuasa kat atas tu
3605853 walau apa pun bro opinion gua kerajaan tak sepatut nya buat kita macam ni kerajaan cakap mereka terpaksa mengambil keputusan yang tidak popular demi kepentingan negara reverse psychology la ni nak ambil hati rakyat nak mintak simpati rakyat
3605854 kerajaan nak supaya subsidi yang diberi hanya dirasai oleh mereka yang sepatutnya layak dapat tapi bro kalau bab minyak tariff elektrik tariff air ni semua adalah perkara yang luar kawalan
3605855 kita bayar cukai macam macam cukai cukai pendapat cukai pintu cukai perkhidmatan cukai jalan cukai beli kereta toll lagi kalau kat kl jangan cerita la tollnya duit kita semuanya akhirnya banyak pegi kerajaan semula lagi satu sebab kita ni rakyat malaysia
3605856 kalau tak nak subsidi dirasai oleh rakyat lain macam rakyat singapura kita ikut la macam mana dia buat kat kita setiap kereta diorang dikenakan cas sekali masuk sama rate yang diorang kenakan pada kereta malaysia walaupun kalau kerajaan rasa tak banyak pulangannya yang penting kepentingan kita dijaga terutama rakyat negeri berdaulat johor
3605857 rakyat johor umumnya bro apa yang kita dapat hasil dari pembanjiran rakyat singapura tak de aper manfaat pun yang berniaga kat pasar kat pasar tani kat shopping complex pusat hiburan diorang semua suka gila laaa ya laa diorang boleh ketuk betul betul harga barang tapi kita yang duduk dekat jb ni pun dapat la habuan nya barang makan mahal nak mampus semua nya mahal laa
3605858 tu la dia bro kerajaan suka la diorang bawak masuk aliran tunai kedalam negara kita tu dapat meningkatkan ekonomi negara
3605859 sebab bro gua tengok kerajaan pak lah ni dari awal semua yang diorang cakap dan nak buat adalah untuk bantu rakyat kepentingan rakyat kononnya tapi lama lama gua tengok semua tindakan diorang memang menindas rakyat nak jaga ekonomi lah nak jaga taraf inflasi lah supaya tak naik lepas tu semua yang dipaparkan kat berita kat paper semua yang terbaik tapi realitinya tak baik pun kita kat bawah ni tak rasa aper pun hasil yang kerajaan buat
3605860 bayangkan la bro kenaikan taraf hidup kita ni secara tak langsung naik 40 macam mana nak survive ni
3605861 dah tak leh buat aper dah kita terima aje la sebelum ni pun dah ikat perut skang ni gua tak tau nak ikat aper dah silap silap bole huru hara idup gua ni mana tak nya bro keperluan gua sekeluarga melebihi gaji gua lu nak cita aper lagi
3605862 alaaa normal la sekarang issue petrol dengan tariff elektrik harga barang lain semua confirm naik tak boleh nak kawal
3605863 bro gua rasa kita kena buat something la untuk naikkan taraf ekonomi kita gua dah tak larat nak tanggung semua ni
3605864 jom la kita fikirkan atleast dapat la kita duit tepi
3605865 ok tu bro kat kampung kita ni pun kita boleh buat macam macam kita boleh jana ekonomi kita kalau boleh kita tak perlu belanja duit kita keluar sangat makan kita beli kat warung ni kalau ader rokok kita beli kat sini nak bersukan kita bersukan kat sini nak internet kita pun ader aper aper laa benda yang boleh kita buat supaya duit kita berpusing antara kita kan kita cuba fikir dalam sikit la kan walau pun tak banyak sikit pun kira dah baik
3605866 alaa tu la pasal kita ajer yang pikir macam tu tapi member lain tak pikir pun susah bro nak buat
3605867 tu la dia cabaran kita kita cuba la kongsi dengan member lain aper vision kita aper yang kita mampu buat kalau kita bersatu
3605868 macam sekarang ni pun lu tengok semua buat hal masing masing aje kalau dalam bab ekonomi ni tapi kalau bab lain tu nak nak bab menghabiskan duit boleh pulak kita sepakat berbincang sakan tapi benda tu bukan menjana ekonomi kita pun deficit kan kita lagi ader
3605869 tu la dia orang kita ni terutama bangsa kita ni
3605870 gua rasa la kan bro diaorang dah selesa dengan aper yang diorang ader buat aper nak berubah kalau sekarang dah selesa buat aper nak berubah kalau kepenting untuk diri sendiri hilang lebih baik ikutkan aje keadaan kalau tuhan nak bagi kita kaya dia bagi laa kan
3605871 tu la dia typical malay mengharapkan sesuatu dengan goyang kaki kerja tak nak buat tapi berangan lebih
3605872 kalau sorang sorang tak de team memang la susah beb sebab tu nabi pun ader sahabat kira think tank la tu
3605873 aper aper pun perangai tu bergantung pada diri sendiri kalau kita nak berubah sentiasa nak tingkatkan diri kira sentiasa positive aje kira bagus tu tapi kalau yang jenis negative asik fikir susah aje ha ni masalah
3605874 mmm hari hari benda yang sama kita buat kaedah yang sama sesekali cuba la buat benda lain yang boleh tingkat kan diri kita kita cuba la aper macam kaedah pun janji tak la membelakangkan agama kita untuk perbaharui diri kita

3605878 socialism in general has a record of failure so blatant that only an intellectual could ignore or evade it
3605879 the japanese people will curse the military forces of imperial japan
3605880 it looks like the disarmament first tears off the arms and legs and then has our lives offered for consumption by our enemies
3605881 the people should continue to fight bravely even if the population of japan decreases from 100 million to one
3605882 the japanese people who tend to have a simple way of thinking could curse the military forces of japan
3605883 i have never dreamt that japanese government leaders and the people are so spiritless that they raise their hands easily
3605884 as for moral responsibility i will apologize with my death as a japanese i will not allow myself to stand and be accused at a trial staged by our enemies
3605885 frightened by new types of bombs and scared of the soviet unions entry into the war
3605886 the japanese government has accepted the notion that japan is the loser and it appears to be going to accept unconditional surrender
3605887 such a position frustrates officers and soldiers of the imperial armed forces
3605888 is on a course for making a humiliating peace or humiliating surrender
3605889 now that the government has decided to proceed to diplomatic processes toward surrender after gaining the emperors judgment i have decided to refrain from making any comments about it although i have maintained a separate view
3605890 i am determined to offer an apology with my death and take moral responsibility for leading the country into such a situation
3605891 we are concerned that this could have a serious effect on our athletes
3605892 we feel there has been an exceedingly long list of tests and we find this extremely unusual
3605893 it is a major concern to us and they testers have taken a lot of blood
3605894 estar junto a esos nombres en la historia ol mpica es un logro fant stico es definitivamente un honor he tenido la posibilidad de pasar un rato con carl lewis y he intercambiado algunas palabras con spitz aqu y all es realmente fant stico
3605895 we started the torrentprivacy project at the end of 2007 the idea was to give torrent users an anonymous bittorrent service from a party they can trust torrentreactor has been online for approximately 4 years and we believe that when people see that torrentprivacy uses ns1 ns2 torrentreactor net as dns servers they wont have any questions about a possible government setup of torrentprivacy com
3605896 we dont like the situation where two organizations from the usa believe they can rule the world the pirate bay showed them that other countries have other laws and american laws dont work outside of usa we want to be the pain in their asses and allow users to download what they want without fear of a sudden door knock
3605897 torrentfreak seriously think things through before you write articles on them
3605898 these guys are offering your cheap ssh tunnels through which to torrent theyre not putting a price on it because theyre trying to make money off of you guys its because the bandwidth involved is monumental
3605899 for just a little bit more than that id rather get a seedbox
3605900 what the hell these guys are offering your cheap ssh tunnels through which to torrent theyre not putting a price on it because theyre trying to make money off of you guys its because the bandwidth involved is monumental 500 users could easily reach 100tb month and that kind of bandwidth doesnt come cheap lets also not forget they need the bandwidth to substain multiple users all downloading at close to their maximum speed
3605901 image taken from brooklyn side the expressway is behind and manhattan is in front
3605902 this shot was taken from the free ferry that takes you to see all the waterfalls this is looking south
3605903 my view is from above looking down to the east river i learned how to get access to this part of the brooklyn bridge when i was a teenager finally a practical use for that info
3605904 there was a picnic and screening of stand by me last night in the park under the bridge snapped this at sunset before the movie started
3605905 walked along the piers to see all four falls yesterday
3605906 the governors island ferry docks in front of the waterfall as the staten island ferry passes
3605907 i took the ferry to governors island and on the way back a thunderstorm came with large gusts of wind the waterfall started blowing onto the island soaking the people waiting for the next ferry
3605908 from brooklyn bridge park you can see the waterfalls at the brooklyn bridge and just north of the manhattan bridge

3605914 we are pleased to help forge this new alliance between standard chartered bank nigeria and lapo which will help to fuel lapos expansion into southwest and eastern nigeria thus giving more poor nigerians access to financial services and financial security
3605915 this is the largest portfolio financing support lapo has received so far from a commercial bank it has great implications for our efforts to reach a large number of female owners of microenterprises across the country
3605916 the grameen foundation standard chartered bank nigeria lapo financing is a bold statement on the institutional strength of lapo as well as in the enormous potential of the nascent nigerian microfinance sector
3605917 the bank focuses on activities that not only enhance our business performance now and for the long term but also enhance the economic development of the countries we operate in have a positive impact on the environment and society as well as contribute to good governance i am quite proud of this tripartite partnership with grameen foundation and lapo which has given us the opportunity to provide major support for nigerias microfinance sector
3605918 iraq spy service planned by u s to stem attacks
3605919 the new service will be trained financed and equipped largely by the cia with help from jordan
3605920 badran and ayad allawi leader of the ina are spending much of this week at cia headquarters in langley to work out the details of the new program both men have worked closely with the cia over the past decade in unsuccessful efforts to incite coups against saddam hussein
3605921 damming every river and putting wind turbines of every ridge line
3605922 obviously the effects of damming a river are far greater than erecting wind turbines large dams usually mean major permanent changes to water courses with significant impacts on wildlife and ecosystems
3605923 well all be better prepared when we see what went right and what went wrong
3605924 if something went sideways there it would probably level tilbury island
3605925 it would depend on the severity of the incident and the direction of the wind
3605926 there could be a number of people affected the lower mainland having evolved as it has has come closer and closer to industry with our residential development
3605927 all of these trucks are loaded in essence with a very volatile gas thats very combustible
3605928 theres always a risk but the industry has extremely high safety standards and we havent encountered any problems
3605929 whether its in a huge tanker or a small barbecue cylinder they all need to be treated with respect
3605930 well probably have to look at what we have in place now and see if we can improve on it

3605936 this includes a more robust critical mass around research for new zealand s horticulture and food industries
3605937 this includes such things as the sustainability challenges facing our food exports in international markets and the expanding global demand for food
3605938 while there would be economies of scale achieved by a merger its really about two successful businesses merging to create one of greater critical mass which is sustainable in the long term and able to deliver even greater value to new zealand and to national and international clients
3605939 its the scientists and other staff who have made these two institutes major contributors to the success of our multi billion dollar horticulture food and seafood industries
3605940 it makes more sense to have our scientists working together rather than competing for funds to carry out research

3605952 in the ongoing russian vs georgia cyberwar we have an indication of lists of georgian governmental sites actively distributed across russian web forums

3606065 you got a guy who is ready to be president on day 1 who understands the world for what it is
3606066 the thing about sen obama hes playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia
3606067 sen mccain has talked for years about the dangers of russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbors
3606068 there is a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience
3606069 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
3606070 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
3606071 russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3606072 he was not calling for equivalence between russia and georgia he was calling for a ceasefire to stop the violence after russia invaded it was a totally different order of magnitude
3606073 it is based on an exaggerated and deliberately misleading perception of senator obamas initial statement which was issued early while the crisis was unfolding
3606074 this is an attempt by people supporting senator mccain to politicize a great international tragedy and its not worthy of the dimensions of the problem especially when both candidates have roughly the same position
3606075 part of the reason we dont have leverage is that we dont have a u s russian relationship it has been adrift
3606076 its easy to say something belligerent about russia im no friend of vladimir putin and cheap shots about tough talk are all well and fine but what are you doing to actually make the situation better
3606077 this type of bluster is fairly counterproductive because it is a bluff theres nothing we can do about this

3606085 convention on extradition of the security file in anbar were ready after having signed the three major parties namely the iraqi government and the governor and the coalition forces but the conservative objection at the last minute to matter
3606086 in case of any objection from the three parties to hand over the security file and in any iraqi province were not then hand over the security file so that harmony between them
3606087 the extradition of the security file is not limited troop coalition and the iraqi government but requires approval of local government in the province

3606125 being deeply loved by someone gives you strength while loving someone deeply gives you courage
3606126 it hurts to love someone and not be loved in return but what is the most painful is to love someone and never find the courage to let the person know how you feel
3606127 love makes a subtle man out of a crude one it gives eloquence to the mute it gives courage the cowardly and makes the idle quick and sharp
3606128 have enough courage to trust love one more time and always one more time
3606129 if you are lucky enough to find a way of life you love you have to find the courage to live it

3606134 i have to underline that this was not a government to government thing
3606135 this was between the georgian government and a private israeli company they have provided highly qualified training
3606136 from 2 500 to 3 000 mercenaries fight against russias peacekeepers on behalf of georgia
3606137 it is not a protest against land transfer this is anger against india
3606138 including on military and strategic facilities in the southern federal district
3606139 at federally financed nursing homes rehabilitation centers and shelters for homeless veterans
3606140 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3606141 easy development money that undercuts our efforts to improve their financial governance
3606142 obese adults and those with adult onset type 2 diabetes mellitus may already have lower levels of cognitive function in childhood consistent with a subtle developmental impairment
3606143 this study cannot identify the specific biological processes linking poorer physical control and co ordination in childhood with later obesity however it suggests that some of the processes associated with poorer neurological function in obese adults have their origins in childhood
3606144 previous tensions both in south ossetia and abkhazia the other piece of georgia that has declared sovereignty had somehow been resolved without an actual war someone clearly wanted this one to go further
3606145 it can never hurt especially this time of the year
3606146 he was throwing strikes he was a little bit wilder tonight so maybe he needs to just be a little wild it was an outstanding performance from him
3606147 thats big against a guy whos been dealing like that we got on him early
3606148 we took the lead first and i got more confident on the mound
3606149 i felt out of whack it wasnt until the second or third inning that i got more acclimated
3606150 when he got in trouble he threw the ball well
3606151 our opportunities tonight seem to come with two outs when things got dicey he stepped up and made some good pitches
3606152 no you will keep you promise or i will leave
3606153 hey i caught a fish and look here it is my fish
3606154 oh my god i am so so so glad i didnt stay
3606155 it indicates that early eating patterns have effects that persist over time regardless of later changes in diet
3606156 so it is very important for children to eat a well balanced diet from an early age if they are to get the best out of their education
3606157 i hope my opinion counts for something and that pemex is not privatized because if it is theyre going to continue privatizing things like water and light
3606158 its unjust that they want to take from us the only thing we have left
3606159 it will be exciting to see mexico in that regard
3606160 we have the tools of history on our side the government responds to change when we demand it
3606161 we were bused up here from our summer program at brown university when we saw the protest we had to join in id much rather do this than go shopping
3606162 this is the first demonstration ive seen in boston in nine months
3606163 68 olympics salute deserves no honor espn ignored the violent extremism behind the black power salute given by two medalists at the mexico city games
3606164 the stench of self congratulation surrounding espns decision to honor smith and carlos is thicker than the air in a locker room after double overtime the argument that smiths and carlos critics must dine on their denunciations rests on an inch deep nostalgia and the triumph of celebrity culture
3606165 the greatest threat to the internal security of the country
3606166 i do support the individuals who decided to make the sacrifice by giving up the chance to win an olympic medal i respect their courage we need to understand the reason and frustration behind these protests it was different in my day perhaps we lacked courage
3606167 they enjoy the challenge of the game under these particular laws
3606168 so its going to require a different athlete to play under these laws and be on the field for 80 minutes and some astute substitutions
3606169 its a different ball game and its something you learn as you go along
3606170 given the sanctions you dont want to be caught too often in a breakdown in your own territory because youre liable to have a free kick against you and then the momentum starts for the other team
3606171 if muslims can kill each other during ramadan they can appear before the grand jury all they cant do is eat before sunset i believe mr request is part of the attempted islamization of the american justice system
3606172 in this particular arab islamic culture she would not be able to stop him from leaving
3606173 call him a racist in signs if you see him
3606174 call him an injustice call him whatever you want to call him but in his face all the time
3606175 if music be the food of love play on give me excess of it that surfeiting the appetite may sicken and so die that strain again it had a dying fall o it came oer my ear like the sweet sound that breathes upon a bank of violets stealing and giving odour enough no more tis not so sweet now as it was before
3606176 its something i had carefully planned for a long while
3606177 my equestrian background certainly lends itself to something like this i am very proud to have been asked to write the forward to the book whats it all about alfie a book to raise funds for animal welfare and rescue animal rights and animal rescue is something i have been passionate about since a child i have supported animal charities and have been an active animal rights supporter all of my life my daughter angel also wrote a poem which is included in this book
3606178 its a book of poetry created by elaine and rod remnant ashton
3606179 it has been launched to raise funds for the care of the animals on jollity farm a small shelter in gerrans cornwall where mary alice and her husband chris rescue displaced unwanted and animals who were doomed for slaughter jollity farm provides sanctuary for them for the rest of their natural lives

3606181 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3606182 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances its not too bad i guess

3606190 we anticipate the completion of riversouth phase 1 sometime next summer
3606191 with work on riversouth phase 2 from rich street to mound street to begin shortly thereafter
3606192 this is not because of the quality of treatment in beijing far from it but because the hospital in hong kong has specialised equipment hill may need
3606193 we hope he pulls through he is an australian we are giving him as much assistant as possible
3606194 he is not only good at his job he is well respected and well liked from the stewards to the jockeys to the trainers and thats something hes achieved in a short space of time
3606195 hes always been that sort of guy that you knew would make it to the top in race calling and sports broadcasting in general
3606196 it was a big step for him and he was really looking forward to it especially the equestrian events its just really unfortunate whats happened
3606197 he always tried so hard and it seems the conditions over there have affected some of the athletes as well as some of the commentators
3606198 it will unload the work of the heart providing time and options when you are in the middle of high risk events
3606199 this new device can be inserted through a catheter similar to a routine heart catheterization it allows the heart to rest and in some cases recover
3606200 it is another example of forward thinking technology and research brought to the bedside

3606202 this first patent secures the intellectual property on our approach to treat resistant bacteria using new chemistry against an established antibacterial target
3606203 we believe this technology holds promise for the treatment of both gram positive and gram negative bacterial infections
3606204 vitamin d and health in the 21st century an update
3606205 given recent findings its easy to see why people are so enthusiastic about the potential power of vitamin d but we must recognize the limitations of any study and exercise caution when making broad public health recommendations
3606206 this is a very complex set of issues and there is still a lot we dont know about how vitamin d levels affect health especially across different age groups and ethnic populations
3606207 its tempting to think that an essential nutrient is safe at any level that if some is good more is better
3606208 weve learned that this isnt always true and there are potential harms associated with high levels of many nutrients
3606209 his shrewdness resourcefulness and endurance enabled him to capture troy through the device of the trojan horse and endure nine years of wandering and adventures before reaching his home in ithaca where his wife penelope and son telemachus awaited him classical opinion was divided on whether he was an unscrupulous politician or a wise and honourable statesman
3606210 the american system has board certified and board registered psychiatrists
3606211 the novelist norman mailer who coined the term factoid defines it as a
3606212 as to my impressions of densen gerber i think it suffice to say i found her a difficult person to work with and was relieved that her visits were short looking back i think the probe system and the marathon groups were probably a form of brain washing and i would not recommend their use in this day and age i never did like the awareness signs much
3606213 ohhh its a shocking system based on psychic sic brutality
3606214 i formed a very low opinion of her densen gerber when i first met her in the 80s
3606215 put your cat out and turn your alarm on dumb arse
3606216 please use whatever security you have and it may be as simple as locking the back door or remembering to activate the alarm when you go out
3606217 when you are off to bed or just watching television remember to lock the back door
3606218 take the hint and remember fred flintstone and the tvnz cat when youve put the cat out lock the door
3606219 recent files read entry via unlocked rear door entry via unlocked garage window entry via lounge window the list goes on
3606220 while they were cleaning out the temple basement they found the lost books of the law
3606221 theres this wonderful movie on tonight and were going to watch it together and its called night of the lepus
3606222 is this like the time we had to watch night of the lepus
3606223 gee mom and dad arent looking so ill do the whole genetically mutated rabbit switcheroo
3606224 double score we leveled up weve gone from scaring people to being homicidal bunny maniacs
3606225 hey man we got a right to live too whats up with that
3606226 warning evacuate killer rabbits are on their way into town
3606227 bbw seeks 2 thin wms to dominate and eat steak
3606228 oh my god its satan and he has come for my soul
3606229 hey tim i saw you up there and had no idea you do comedy
3606230 if you dont like to clean you should never have gotten married
3606231 a woman should learn in quietness and full submission i do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man she must be silent
3606232 if there is but one fool left to fight the cause is not lost
3606233 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours
3606234 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3606235 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear
3606236 instead we got exactly the opposite result as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater
3606237 the additional aspect that our method offers is a much more accurate picture of the process of tropical storm and hurricane formation as compared to the global models
3606238 our ongoing work with this model and others should lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between climate and global hurricane activity
3606239 we know that parents have tremendous influence over how many fruits and vegetables their children eat
3606240 when parents eat more fruits and vegetables so do their children when parents eat and give their children high fat snacks or soft drinks children learn these eating patterns instead
3606241 this research shows that its important to communicate with parents in real world settings
3606242 they control the food environment for their young child this environment is key to not only what children eat today but how they will eat in the future
3606243 overweight children have already been exposed to salty sweet foods and learned to like them
3606244 to keep a child from becoming overweight parents need to expose them early to a variety of healthy foods and offer the foods many times
3606245 we want families to provide their child with an environment in which they not only learn how to eat healthy but have the opportunity to practice what they learn
3606246 and by partnering with parents as teachers we now can disseminate this program to their sites nationwide this further impacts healthy eating patterns in parents and their preschool children
3606247 with this test we can easily and safely monitor the iron levels in marmosets and tamarins for early identification of individuals that may be predisposed to develop hemosiderosis an overload of iron in the body despite the low iron diet that has been fine tuned to the unique requirements of these species
3606248 commonly discoveries in animals lead to helping human health but this is an instance in which methodologies developed to detect conditions in humans can help veterinarians provide the same level of care to animals that share similar conditions especially our closely related non human primates
3606249 caregivers have a long exposure to stresses and losses from the dementia and fatigue that comes from caring for their spouses so they experience fewer positive emotions
3606250 some may have feelings of guilt about participating in activities with friends or in the community when their loved ones are no longer able to do so
3606251 while rational drug design remains a perfectly valid way to develop cancer therapies we also need approaches that are less costly and more productive of new effective treatments
3606252 you could say this is more of a guerrilla approach instead of screening millions of untested compounds for an agent that inhibits or stimulates a particular molecular target we chose to screen a large library of already approved drugs for novel activity against melanoma cells and then advance the most promising candidate rapidly to clinical practice
3606253 our ability to identify novel treatments for melanoma and advance them rapidly into the clinic very much depends on nyus multidisciplinary approach to melanoma care and research
3606254 to be effective translational medicine cannot be unidirectional discovery moves continuously back and forth between the clinic and the bench we are now focused on determining the range of doses to be tested in the clinic whether specific types of melanomas will respond better than others and whether combining mebendazole with other agents will be of further benefit
3606255 all moors can cope with some harriers but few gamekeepers allow any of these predators to breed because of the fear that numbers will subsequently flourish a ceiling scheme is a way of encouraging grouse managers to put an end to illegal killing of harriers safe in the knowledge that numbers will not reach densities where they can threaten the viability of their grouse moors
3606256 if successful this could prove to be a way to both minimise the local impact of predation on grouse moors and increase the national population of harriers providing a win win situation for harrier conservation and grouse management
3606257 hunters have been slow to recognise that illegal killing of raptors is unacceptable in 21st century society where there is strong support for conservation conservationists on the other hand have been unwilling to compromise over any form of intervention to limit harrier densities citing european legislation which prevents such action
3606258 we feel that a fundamental change in attitude is required from all parties to resolve the conflict between harriers and grouse if those involved genuinely wish to strive for a solution then compromises will be required and attitudes to predators their control and their protection will have to be modified to accommodate changed circumstances
3606259 our earlier work showed that feeding harriers can greatly reduce predation rates on grouse chicks however we still do not know how feeding will affect harrier numbers in the long term and indeed whether fed harriers and grouse shooting can coexist
3606260 some of these issues will be addressed by ongoing work at langholm however we suggest that the quickest way of finding an effective solution to this problem is to simultaneously make progress on different fronts it is sensible to test a harrier ceiling now and not wait for ten years until the langholm moor demonstration project is complete
3606261 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
3606262 we had encouraging results including several long term survivors in patients with stage iv cancers that had spread to distant sites
3606263 previous studies determined the maximal radiotherapy doses for single organs
3606264 but this technique has not been tested for simultaneous use on multiple organs so we designed a dose escalation trial to determine the optimal dose starting with fairly low levels and increasing the dose in later groups of patients
3606265 we have seen improved response rates with higher radiation doses without an increase in side effects yet
3606266 and several of them remain disease free one of them three years after treatment
3606267 if brain damage related to alzheimers disease begins earlier in adult life then having less reserve due to a smaller brain could compromise intellectual ability in those destined to get alzheimers and lead to them getting less education
3606268 although it has been known for many years that individuals with lower education have a greater risk of getting alzheimers this is the first report showing that reduced educational attainment may actually be an early sign of the underlying disease
3606269 some early life exposures such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or personal characteristics may impair the development of physical control and coordination as well as increasing the risk of obesity in later life
3606270 rather than being explained by a single factor an accumulation throughout life of many associated cultural personal and economic exposures is likely to underlie the risks for obesity and some elements of associated neurological function
3606271 some of these same gene regulatory networks are re activated in the adult to direct the growth of new blood vessels
3606272 this can be beneficial as in the case of a heart attack
3606273 finding that a single factor regulates a large part of the angiogenic process creates a significant target for therapeutic development for any disease involving the vascular system
3606274 the next step is to find ways to modify this microrna in the setting of disease and test its ability to alter the disease process
3606275 our results could contribute to the development of targeted therapies and thus improve the treatment of cerebellar tumours in children
3606276 but for that to be possible we first need to understand the principles of how the tumours develop
3606277 if we know how a tumour arises at the molecular level we can also develop specific therapies that actually treat the cause of that particular condition
3606278 normally the signalling pathway ensures a balance of growth and maturation of cells
3606279 but if disrupted it can lead to uncontrolled growth of cells and thus the onset of cancer
3606280 all of our studies have shown that medulloblastomas can only develop from granule cells and their progenitors
3606281 other cells on the other hand such as the large purkinje cells of the cerebellum do not become tumourigenic they dont seem bothered by these mutations at all
3606282 but we also found olig2 in progenitors of the granule cells of the cerebellum and in tumour cells
3606283 that means this protein also influences the formation and multiplication of cancer cells which makes it clear once again just how closely normal and malignant development processes resemble one another we hope our results will contribute to a targeted therapy for medulloblastomas that will require further research however which we already have in the planning
3606284 i may act like a monkey but i dont act like one
3606285 the cells status was indeed bad as they had been stored for a long time so we cautiously approached the work
3606286 but the scientific technology has also developed compared with when we cloned snuppy there is no room for any doubt over whether they are real clones
3606287 for the rest of my life i will love them and consider them my korean brothers
3606288 performing plantings is a never ending process unless the causes of plant losses are understood and addressed
3606289 considering what is known about past species changes in inwood park and other new york city parks the new york city parks department natural resources group ecological restoration efforts would benefit from structured scientific research on plantings survival through partnerships with scientists who have studied the ecology of new york city parks
3606290 todays plantings for the ecological restoration of inwood park are similar to private estate plantings done following the american revolution period which have been decimated by subsequent use and management of the land
3606291 the forest and wetland communities of inwood hill park are more diverse and have a greater structural variation than revealed by previous research
3606292 considering the results of this research on the long term ecology of the inwood park forest the natural resources group could avoid the problem observed by spanish born american poet and philosopher george santayana those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3606293 manipulating this microrna provides a completely new way of addressing cardiovascular disorders
3606294 microrna research represents a new frontier in understanding and treating human disease this is just a hint of what can come
3606295 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3606296 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
3606297 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
3606298 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern
3606299 weve speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting
3606300 the reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures which is the opposite of most chemical reactions
3606301 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions dont depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
3606302 this is not how we explain chemistry to high school students
3606303 heres a situation where we were studying this purely environmental problem but because the findings are so fundamental it may have broader ramifications to biological systems that depend on hydrogen bonds
3606304 the key is knowing where to look and how to identify new chemical entities and with the computing resources we have at purdue we can help identify processes to within experimental uncertainty
3606305 we couldnt have done this without the supercomputing power that we have available
3606306 never has there been an audience as friendly as this one
3606307 we have people come to this in costume and they look better than we do one guy came out in full armor a mom brought her two sons dressed as king arthur and patsy we can hear them saying the lines with us
3606308 you cant ask anyone to make decisions for you because its just too heavy there is a lot of rush to treatment when what you really need is time to research and think about how you want to approach this take your time christina there is no rush use your cancer to learn and grow and as a force to work for you you will make it the success and drive you have had in your career will be the same strengths you will use to win over this nasty disease and i am here if you want to talk to someone who was there
3606309 my own people used to say to me you speak like a white woman what does that even mean anyway everyone has their way of speaking and living their life
3606310 no one should be judging and assuming that because im black i have to speak in that hip hop way thats something i prefer not to do
3606311 erin and i are thrilled and cant wait to meet our newest addition
3606312 years ago you got the spontaneous creativity that happened between live musicians
3606313 you cannot get that from machines or producers working on their computers
3606314 the taglines are a part of a way to honor this being the 60th anniversary of the prime time emmys by featuring some of tvs most unforgettable classic lines from the past 60 years recited by some of entertainments biggest stars
3606315 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3606316 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3606317 while we were slow dancing my crush and i had our first kiss
3606318 people always step up and do things out of the ordinary at the olympics
3606319 you have to win eight gold medals to get noticed he wins a gold medal and everyone says one down seven to go people have no idea how hard it is to get up on the blocks and swim out of his mind like that
3606320 whether he wins eight gold medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen
3606321 we gave our best effort if we came up short hes not going to be looked at as a guy who was on a relay that lost or that he came up short nah hes an amazing athlete probably the best ever in this sport regardless of what happens here hes going to go down as that
3606322 i jumped in the air and almost fell in the pool
3606323 i was thinking if there was anybody on this team or in the world who could do it it would be jason who could pull this off i was pounding on the blocks saying aaaaah come on we looked up at the board and it was phenomenal i dont think anybody in the world could have done a better job without a doubt
3606324 we were the favorites in both of those years this year we were actually considered the underdogs in past olympics it just wasnt attainable theres no way i was going to catch a guy whos two seconds ahead of me
3606325 when i flipped at 50 meters and saw how far ahead he was and he was the world record holder until about two minutes before that the thought crossed my mind for a split second theres no way then i changed i said you know what this is ridiculous its the olympics im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts im going to go out in five seconds i was thinking all these things i got supercharged and just took it from there it was unreal
3606326 he got his hand on the wall and i got chills seeing their reactions and how happy they were
3606327 he was part of it and were part of it whether he wins eight gold medals or not that wasnt our responsibility we just did the best we could do
3606328 ya me and catsrule are going to do a sweaty wrestling video we have been playing with each other like we are wrestlers really cool
3606329 jesus crist josh after seeing this i hate you even more now p s stop saying hi to me for no reson
3606330 the soggy feces of a leprosy infected tyrannosaurus rex infected after feasting on the used tampons of wilma flintstone
3606331 better the complete absence of a devil than the devil youre on fairly intimate terms with who enjoys lobbing fireballs rocks or condensed snot at you
3606332 i will call you amp then they dont i hate when you call or text or even email somone amp they never return it
3606333 consigues muchas m s cosas con buenas palabras y una pistola que con buenas palabras solamente
3606334 would not be in the best interest of the community
3606335 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3606336 there is no way to tell if something is going to be successful if you dont try it out
3606337 thats the whole aim of this to make public works services more predictable
3606338 our goal is education if we have zero tickets to write perfect
3606339 we dont have all the answers figured out for the parking ban
3606340 thats why its six months theres going to be trials and tribulations
3606341 why bug her shes there working she should be able to buy ice cream in peace
3606342 we dont want this to create an eyesore for the residents who have been there for many years
3606343 right now the cost of steel and everything else is so high that were taking this all the way through bid to see what it would cost first
3606344 you literally went from a protector of our community to a plague on our community
3606345 it is necessary to impose a sentence that will ensure that the defendant will never again be free
3606346 the most loving caring responsible respectable and most decent person i have ever known
3606347 the main thing we want to do is get on with our lives
3606348 they get the land they want and we get to keep our home itll just be a different address
3606349 neither party is a winner neither party is a loser we both bent a little bit
3606350 at the end of the day its not perfect but both villages got something out of it isnt that what compromise is all about
3606351 that is when the relationship between the two communities started to go downhill
3606352 i think the village did need its own police department
3606353 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3606354 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3606355 i think whats interesting is after all these years that ted kaczynski would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims
3606356 i feel there was 20 community members that were involved and the rest of the community has no idea what was going on
3606357 with the jail project i feel we have shown we are very sensitive as neighbors
3606358 we have bent over backward to make this a beautiful facility and i am sure that if we put a maintenance facility there it will also be a beautiful facility
3606359 i went to a lot of the public meetings and i heard the people say why are you doing this to us well were doing this to you because weve spent a lot of money its always been our plan its never been a secret were going to put a good facility there the people of st charles better work with us or get used to it
3606360 i dont want people to feel that this was shoved down their throats
3606361 i know its just a concept plan but ive seen concepts carry all the way through to the final project
3606362 theres only one way that we can do the improvements of the roads in wauconda and that is through referendum
3606363 we know for sure we cant do our own financing because with the motor fuel tax money it has already been earmarked for other projects
3606364 the village is not allowed to campaign for or against the referendum
3606365 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3606366 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3606367 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3606368 about 11am aest one of the aircraft pilots declared an aircraft emergency and diverted to coffs harbour airport to land
3606369 one hawk landed safely at 11 40am and the other has returned to williamtown near newcastle
3606370 we are looking into the possibility of the aircraft clipping powerlines
3606371 the aircraft was circling over the ocean to receive a standard damage check from the other hawk pilot
3606372 while circulating the aircraft was also burning off fuel to reduce its landing weight
3606373 his recent statements indicating that the interim government has no intention of honouring that undertaking are of great concern
3606374 we placed our participants in an fmri scanner to measure their brain activity while we first showed our subject short 3s movie clips of an actor sipping from a cup and then looking disgusted
3606375 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth
3606376 finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner
3606377 our striking result is that in all three cases the same location of the anterior insula lit up the anterior insula is the part of the brain that is the heart of our feeling of disgust
3606378 patients who have damage to the insula because of a brain infection for instance lose this capacity to feel disgusted if you give them sour milk they would drink it happily and say it tastes like soda
3606379 what this means is that whether we see a movie or read a story the same thing happens we activate our bodily representations of what it feels like to be disgusted and that is why reading a book and viewing a movie can both make us feel as if we literally feel what the protagonist is going through
3606380 best there ever was best there is now and best there ever will be
3606381 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3606382 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3606383 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3606384 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3606385 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3606386 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3606387 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3606388 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3606389 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3606390 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3606391 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3606396 with the human touch inherent in any performance autocorrected digitally we lose much of the element that gives music its emotive contours sometimes playing slightly behind the beat or slightly below the correct pitch is what makes a piece inspiring
3606397 i am not sure about how anyone else works but the only time i break out such tools is when it is such a joke that it has absolutely no chance of not being laughed at to begin with this brings total trash into the realm of mediocre

3606451 bebaskan kempen daripada rasuah undi caci maki tuduh menuduh tanpa bukti penggunaan bahasa atau isyarat yang kasar dan kesat
3606452 proses demokrasi jika tidak dipandu dengan kesedaran islam akan menjerumuskan kita ke kancah yang serba jijik dan kotor
3606453 lihatlah apa yang terjadi dalam masyarakat kita apabila berpegang dengan demokrasi yang tidak ditapis dengan tapisan wahyu ilahi lahirnya politik wang permusuhan sesama muslim tanpa alasan yang benar fitnah mengfitnah caci mencaci dan segala macam racun permusuhan dan kebencian yang hidup atas nama baja demokrasi
3606454 maka saya yang teramat daif ini mengambil kesempatan mengingatkan para calon dan mereka yang terlibat dalam kempen pilihan raya permatang pauh yang kebetulan juga merupakan kawasan undi saya untuk berpegang dengan prinsip prinsip islam ketika berkempen
3606455 bebaskan kempen anda dari rasuah undi caci maki tuduh menuduh tanpa bukti penggunaan bahasa atau isyarat yang kasar dan kesat membuka aib orang tanpa sebarang keperluan yang diizinkan syarak dan seumpamanya
3606456 kesemua itu adalah dosa walaupun atas nama demokrasi dan kegilaan undi keperluan politik umat bukan itu semua
3606457 sebaliknya kita ingin mendengar siapakah yang memiliki pemikiran dan idea yang mampu membangunkan masyarakat dan negara ke arah yang lebih harmoni terurus dan sopan berdasarkan teras teras yang diredhahi allah
3606458 janganlah nanti generasi baru yang sedang membesar akhirnya tidak mengenali politik melainkan dengan wajah serba kehodohan dan kebiadapan cara dan bahasa
3606459 hak hak setiap muslim lebih mulia di sisi allah daripada kerusi politik yang menjadi kegilaan sebahagian manusia
3606460 kita sudah penat mendengar maki hamun ketidakjujuran pembohongan dan penipuan atas nama politik berilah ruang untuk rakyat hidup dalam udara politik yang bersih dan segar jangan jadikan mereka terbiasa dengan pencemaran sehingga akhirnya mereka sebati dengan kejijikan siasah yang tiada penghujungnya

3606481 things that would have seemed fantastic 15 years ago are now routine
3606482 we have to rethink what is a reasonable expectation of privacy
3606483 the lesson here for washington is that any modern conflict will include a cyberwarfare component simply because its too inexpensive to be passed up
3606484 the best defensive strategy is always preparedness weve spent eight years completely ignoring that while the chinese and indian governments have been paying really close attention and investing many tens of billions of dollars
3606485 we have family coming together from all parts of the country to support a cause for which my dad was passionate about and one that we have adopted as our own
3606486 our goal is to raise as much as we can
3606487 to help those who through no fault of their own are recovering from mental illness
3606488 you sometimes think they the scores cant go any higher and then our wonderful students and wonderful teachers make it happen
3606489 this is really a time to celebrate the good news
3606490 it adds to the quality of life in naperville that makes it an attractive place to live and to educate your kids
3606491 that one tenth of a point decrease in the districts composite score is really insignificant from an educational standpoint
3606492 our composite this year is still a pretty darn strong score considering 99 percent of our students took the exam
3606493 we always look at our buildings we look at them individually and we look at a lot of dynamics particularly we look at all of our demographics we look at our kids and how they scored earlier as they came through the system
3606494 considering both high schools still remain in the top 8 percent in the nation im happy with that
3606495 i would not be surprised to see a change in the scores and the way that we do score across all three buildings when we add that third building because i think just logistically it will just change
3606496 it would not surprise if theres some shift but well wait and see theres never any guarantee
3606497 everybody knows if its the stammtisch and they dont belong they dont go there
3606498 i want to be able to talk fluently and thats why i come
3606499 for me it is nice to hear some german spoken
3606500 if you use the wrong article the sentence doesnt make sense
3606501 you have to learn your noun with the article from day one
3606502 its a little bit like halloween but we dont dress up
3606503 my activities in german class are very varied i think that makes it interesting
3606504 you have an opportunity to speak with native speakers and students
3606505 he practices it morning noon and night thats how he got so fabulous at it
3606506 ive had the support of a lot of people in the community
3606507 he had no choice because he was walking into a room didnt realize zulas was there and it was like surprise he did whatever he had to do to protect his family
3606508 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3606509 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3606510 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3606511 everyone knows the next one could be ukraine and then poland all of europe should be here now
3606512 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3606513 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3606514 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3606515 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3606516 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3606517 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3606518 several of our store owners got phone calls from friends across the country who saw it
3606519 we are justifiably proud of our program and honors such as this reflect the dedicated work our volunteers do for us and the community
3606520 were up to 1 391 total members now which far and away is more residential members than any mainstreet in the country
3606521 as odd as it sounds its been a challenge to keep them busy
3606522 to say its in bad taste would be an extraordinary understatement
3606523 he thought it would be a senior prank and that people would get a laugh out of it
3606524 it was a pretty serious event at our school theres been pranks but never anything close to this
3606525 personally and professionally i was a bit sickened i was concerned about the sanitation of the school and i also was concerned about the individual who would do something like this
3606526 he absolutely abused those animals and he is responsible for what happened at that school
3606527 swim against the current even a dead fish can go with the flow
3606528 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent
3606529 i have at all times tried to fair and honest with the students the faculty the staff and the community
3606530 at all times i have done what i have felt was in the best interests of the high school
3606531 dr sullivan will long be remembered in gloucester for the many individual families he helped over the past 10 years i wish him all the best in his retirement
3606532 were seeing more of the top tier people let go
3606533 this will be a more ecologically sound building that in the end will save the taxpayers money
3606534 that is going to cut down on our electric bill
3606535 residents definitely will want to see what we have planned
3606536 swim against the current even a dead fish can go with the flow
3606537 j m your dinners are getting cold come down now

3606540 you may find yourself in a beautiful house with a beautiful wife and you may ask yourself well how did i get here
3606541 mommy told me to go to my f cking room
3606542 wheres my diet coke wheres my stuff what did you do with my stuff
3606543 i have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in truth
3606544 aunt kiki i asked jesus to come into my heart and be my savior today
3606545 i have been roughed up now they are filming me
3606546 i have been roughed up they dragged me pulled me and knocked me to the ground now they are filming me
3606547 why are you filming i am a british journalist i have all the olympic accreditation i need
3606548 i have no opinion on tibet i am a journalist
3606549 in athens we were bystanders watching a great swim meet this time its an even better swim meet and we have people in the finals
3606550 everybodys racing everybodys competing were having a great meet and were showing that we belong on this stage
3606551 his best time is 1 3 actually 1 33 seconds faster than mine now
3606552 hes capable of going faster but im a great morning swimmer i just broke my canadian record again so im looking forward to it tomorrow morning
3606553 this event symbolizes what the organization is all about bringing members of the community together universities schools churches businesses families troops civic organizations clubs sports teams and more to move the organization one step closer to ending homelessness in the fox valley area
3606554 hike for hesed gives anyone who wants to make a difference in the lives of the poor and homeless the opportunity to do just that
3606555 with the nfl preseason in august we knew that raffling preseason tickets a signed football and jerseys would be a great way to say thanks to our donors for taking just an hour of your day to donate during the summer
3606556 we understand most community members donate simply for the feeling they get from saving lives with their blood donation but having raffles for the blood donors makes it fun for the donors and our staff
3606557 the crafting of self assembling materials for medicine and energy
3606558 this is one way we can help ensure harriet gifford students return to school feeling good about themselves and ready to learn
3606559 sad to lose a lawyer of such skill determination and professionalism
3606560 sad to lose a lawyer of such skill determination and professionalism
3606561 this tells us if the equipment is telling us the truth
3606562 i personally dont think this is the right time for a pay raise
3606563 our role is to send a message to the taxpayers of illinois
3606564 it is clear this is not a serious attempt to solve the states problems
3606565 would oversee the finances and make sure the budget is tight
3606566 if we do it properly itd be a big help
3606567 we were hoping some cash would come in from developers but that has not happened we need to try and cover our expenses
3606568 it is a one time fee for those coming into the community
3606569 that would help us cover a portion of the deficit
3606570 im kind of surprised at three because i thought we wanted to do more this could be were just doing baby steps
3606571 if we started out with 13 that could put people in shock this is big brother big time
3606572 were trying to get the system up and running and do a periodic evaluation of other intersections
3606573 services still arent being provided and things arent getting done
3606574 what would have been the harm in allowing more time for discussion to keep talking
3606575 minorities are still being bused further theyre in more mobile classrooms they have higher dropout rates the numbers speak for themselves
3606576 hurts u 46 faces enough battles with its image and its perception without adding things like this theres nothing that cant be resolved if people sit down and talk in good faith
3606577 the district is letting all this money be haphazardly spent when they have an obligation to try and settle
3606578 if nothing has made the district come to the table this class action ruling should
3606579 needs to step in and make the tail wag the dog
3606580 he needs to be the one to ask what is it that we can do to resolve these issues to bring both parties to the table and try and hash out these issues
3606581 we were focused on doing the work but a lot of effort had to go to documenting that work
3606582 in terms of how the lawsuit affects the work that im doing
3606583 the plan that i had laid out it certainly will be looking at the lawsuit and what it might mean but it doesnt affect my day to day operations i have to continue to reach out to engage the different segments of the community if that has some kind of outcome on the lawsuit great but in regard to the lawsuit i have to be guided by the board and their attorneys
3606584 the scrimmage is going to be real important to him
3606585 hes been there for two days and hes very athletic and moves real well but can he understand it and learn it safeties coach chucks heater pretty excited about it
3606586 i think ahmad blacks playing great in practice major wrights doing good major wrights got to keep working too i got a player there a couple years ago that was really good thats kind of that standard thats been set our third guy is either going to be will or j dub
3606587 you basically get two shots until you play games so we didnt want to waste a day today
3606588 its a big evaluation its game speed game snaps and weve gotta find out a lot about these guys because the next time we go scrimmage is probably going to be hawaii
3606589 billy latsko was a great football player in a little bit of hindsight we probably could have flipped the ball to him a little bit more he just wasnt a dynamic player i think kestahn will be thats going to give us some flexibility there im really anxious and excited about that
3606590 i can block i can run i can catch the ball
3606591 i can throw the defense off i think i can make some big plays at fullback its hard for a team to defend when you have a dual threat at that position
3606592 hell be at fullback depending on the game plan and depending on what were doing against certain people
3606593 id say hell play fullback enough to make a difference
3606594 he can do all the things he can block he can run he can catch he can do it all
3606595 as a running back i did some fullback type things in the past
3606596 its not too much of a difference i learned the position before we just didnt stick with it its pretty easy theres nothing too dramatic about it
3606597 kestahn is a receiving threat out of the fullback position
3606598 hes a great receiver being able to run a fullback into the flat run the fullback as a jump route motioning him out to go from what looks like three receivers and two running backs to five receivers it can be a best asset for us
3606599 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3606600 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
3606601 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
3606602 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000

3606604 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else

3606606 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3606607 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3606608 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3606609 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3606610 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3606611 were in a recession when has the fed ever raised rates in a recession
3606612 unemployment is headed toward 6 percent mortgage rates on home buyers are at 7 percent and these guys want to raise rates
3606613 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3606614 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3606615 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3606616 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3606617 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3606618 these results show consumers hungry for all varieties of blackberry

3606623 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3606624 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3606625 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3606626 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3606627 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3606628 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3606629 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3606630 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3606631 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3606632 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3606633 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3606634 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3606635 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3606636 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3606637 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3606638 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3606639 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3606640 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3606641 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3606642 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3606643 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3606644 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3606645 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3606646 i thought wouldnt it be nice to sit down and interview him and put together a book about his life
3606647 they know him as their grandfather they wouldnt have known all the things he has gone through so having his stories about what he endured brings it home for them
3606648 what made me think about it was because my mother passed away last year
3606649 all the stories she told me we never recorded and so i thought what a wonderful idea
3606650 he grew up in the berlin ocean city area and lived here his whole life growing up my brother and sister and i heard a lot of stories about what life was like we wanted to preserve these stories weve heard over the years
3606651 he loves to tell stories about what life was like in this area years ago
3606652 so he is enjoying being able to sit down and just let his stream of consciousness go with stories

3606677 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3606678 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3606679 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3606680 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3606681 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3606682 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3606683 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3606684 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3606685 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades

3606689 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3606690 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person

3606696 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3606697 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3606698 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3606699 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3606700 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3606701 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3606702 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3606703 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3606704 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3606705 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3606706 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3606707 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3606708 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3606709 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3606710 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3606711 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star

3606714 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3606715 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3606716 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3606717 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3606718 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3606719 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3606720 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3606721 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3606722 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3606723 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3606724 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources

3606727 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3606728 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3606729 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3606730 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3606731 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3606732 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3606733 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore

3606739 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3606740 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3606741 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

3606747 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3606748 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3606749 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3606750 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3606751 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am

3606754 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3606755 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3606756 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee

3606768 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3606769 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3606770 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3606771 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3606772 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3606773 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3606774 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3606775 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3606776 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3606777 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3606778 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3606779 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months

3606785 but i saw a street called myrtle avenue which runs from borough hall to fresh pond road and down this street no saint ever walked else it would have crumbled down this street no miracle ever passed nor any poet nor any species of human genius nor did any flower ever grow there nor did the sun strike it squarely nor did the rain ever wash it
3606786 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3606787 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3606788 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3606789 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3606790 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3606791 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3606792 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3606793 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3606794 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3606795 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3606796 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3606797 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3606798 i think im going to draw a picture of what might really look like
3606799 that reminds me you have one more inspector gadget dvd coming in from netflix and thatll be the last of them

3606813 and citizenry drag the force laughed by dint of alter
3606814 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3606815 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3606816 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3606817 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3606818 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3606819 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3606820 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3606821 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies

3606823 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens

3606828 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3606829 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3606830 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important

3606840 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3606841 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3606842 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3606843 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3606844 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3606845 just so you all know we did set a record
3606846 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3606847 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3606848 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about

3606857 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3606858 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3606859 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3606860 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3606861 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3606862 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3606863 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3606864 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3606865 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3606866 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3606867 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3606868 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3606869 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3606870 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3606871 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3606872 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3606873 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3606874 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3606875 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3606876 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3606877 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3606878 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3606879 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3606880 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3606881 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on

3606887 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3606888 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3606889 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3606890 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3606891 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm

3606896 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3606897 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3606898 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3606899 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3606900 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3606901 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3606902 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3606903 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3606904 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3606905 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3606906 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3606907 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3606908 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3606909 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3606910 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3606911 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3606912 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3606913 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3606914 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3606915 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3606916 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3606917 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3606918 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3606919 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3606920 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3606921 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3606922 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3606923 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3606924 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3606925 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3606926 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3606927 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3606928 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3606929 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3606930 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3606931 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3606932 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3606933 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3606934 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3606935 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3606936 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3606937 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3606938 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3606939 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3606940 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3606941 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3606942 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3606943 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3606944 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3606945 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3606946 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3606947 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3606948 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3606949 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3606950 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3606951 ah but i was so much older then im younger than that now
3606952 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3606953 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that

3606962 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3606963 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3606964 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise

3606970 is what is at stake when russia engages in behavior that looks like it came from another time
3606971 is as much interested in the relations with russia as russia is in the relations with the united states
3606972 when were trying to negotiate a resolution with the russians
3606973 russia wants membership of the wto but it needs to play by international rules
3606974 europe and russia want a wideranging partnership and co operation agreement
3606975 but this needs all sides to play by the rules business as usual is not compatible with russian aggression in georgia
3606976 a lot more to lose than the soviet union did in 68
3606977 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3606978 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3606979 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3606980 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3606981 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3606982 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3606983 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3606984 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3606985 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3606986 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3606987 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy

3606991 michaels just so good and i think what makes it so special is that hes so good in this environment he raises his game in an environment where so few people do that he stands out a little bit more

3607001 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
3607002 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that
3607003 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know
3607004 man im so fat i cant even sratch my own butt
3607005 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3607006 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3607007 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3607008 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3607009 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3607010 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3607011 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3607012 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3607013 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3607014 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3607015 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3607016 and im not saying we are reigniting the cold war but this is an act of aggression in which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century
3607017 for mccains team it has become the latest incarnation of what
3607018 you got a guy who is ready to be president on day 1 who understands the world for what it is
3607019 the thing about sen obama hes playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia
3607020 sen mccain has talked for years about the dangers of russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbors
3607021 there is a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience
3607022 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
3607023 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
3607024 russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3607025 he was not calling for equivalence between russia and georgia he was calling for a ceasefire to stop the violence after russia invaded it was a totally different order of magnitude
3607026 it is based on an exaggerated and deliberately misleading perception of senator obamas initial statement which was issued early while the crisis was unfolding
3607027 this is an attempt by people supporting senator mccain to politicize a great international tragedy and its not worthy of the dimensions of the problem especially when both candidates have roughly the same position
3607028 part of the reason we dont have leverage is that we dont have a u s russian relationship it has been adrift
3607029 its easy to say something belligerent about russia im no friend of vladimir putin and cheap shots about tough talk are all well and fine but what are you doing to actually make the situation better
3607030 this type of bluster is fairly counterproductive because it is a bluff theres nothing we can do about this
3607031 it has become a race to be see who can be the tougher i cant see anybody suddenly stepping back and becoming a voice of moderation and calling for calm
3607032 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3607033 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3607034 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3607035 the civil war experiences of mr march the absent father in louisa may alcotts little women
3607036 sorry for all the mondays and to those who cant sing
3607037 we talked about breaking seven minutes and we had two guys who averaged 1 45 or better they really did it and pulled it out for the team
3607038 my goggles were filling up with water during the race and i had trouble seeing the wall
3607039 i wanted the world record i wanted a 1 51 or better but given the circumstances its not too bad i guess
3607040 he wont appreciate the history of what is happening here until later maybe years later
3607041 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3607042 talks will never collapse as long as we have tongues
3607043 it is a result of the alert vigilant and patriotic manner they have conducted their day to day duties
3607044 special edition cd rom of the aol service with co branded features and packaging
3607045 the discount store with attitude where department store customers feel very comfortable shopping
3607046 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3607047 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3607048 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3607049 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3607050 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3607051 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3607052 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3607053 it was getting worse and worse i should have stopped earlier i thought it might get a bit better but it didnt
3607054 i need at least four to five days to be able to turn it i should be ok for the u s open
3607055 i cant do much about it its a pity but i have to deal with it
3607056 i hope that this investigation makes steady progress and leads to the quick return of the victims to japan
3607057 the agreement would fall apart in the case japan violates the agreement and does not act as demanded under the agreement

3607064 je ne veux pas terminer la 4e place du groupe pour viter tout prix la russie
3607065 if the current round had come to a successful conclusion last month import tariffs would have come down by half resulting in a saving of 150 billion the developing countries would have contributed a third of the sacrifice but benefited to the extent of two thirds by way of savings
3607066 without the current round this amount could reach a whopping us 48 billion a year
3607067 unless this round sees healthy economies in the developing world there would be no market access for the developed countries
3607068 by the time imports reach that level my farmers would have committed suicide
3607069 but whats on the table is not on my plate and there is not enough on the table to put on everybodys plate
3607070 is what is at stake when russia engages in behavior that looks like it came from another time
3607071 is as much interested in the relations with russia as russia is in the relations with the united states
3607072 when were trying to negotiate a resolution with the russians
3607073 russia wants membership of the wto but it needs to play by international rules
3607074 europe and russia want a wideranging partnership and co operation agreement
3607075 but this needs all sides to play by the rules business as usual is not compatible with russian aggression in georgia
3607076 a lot more to lose than the soviet union did in 68
3607077 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3607078 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3607079 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3607080 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3607081 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3607082 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3607083 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3607084 is that when they dont feel good they dont swim well michael kind of performs independently of his feelings
3607085 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3607086 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3607087 michaels just so good and i think what makes it so special is that hes so good in this environment he raises his game in an environment where so few people do that he stands out a little bit more
3607088 jos luhukay und christian ziege machen einen super job alle behalten die nerven und heben nicht ab und mit den bedingungen dem stadion dem trainingsgel nde und dem fan potential geh rt borussia nat rlich in die erste liga
3607089 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3607090 and im not saying we are reigniting the cold war but this is an act of aggression in which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century
3607091 for mccains team it has become the latest incarnation of what
3607092 you got a guy who is ready to be president on day 1 who understands the world for what it is
3607093 the thing about sen obama hes playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia
3607094 sen mccain has talked for years about the dangers of russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbors
3607095 there is a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience
3607096 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
3607097 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
3607098 russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3607099 he was not calling for equivalence between russia and georgia he was calling for a ceasefire to stop the violence after russia invaded it was a totally different order of magnitude
3607100 it is based on an exaggerated and deliberately misleading perception of senator obamas initial statement which was issued early while the crisis was unfolding
3607101 this is an attempt by people supporting senator mccain to politicize a great international tragedy and its not worthy of the dimensions of the problem especially when both candidates have roughly the same position
3607102 part of the reason we dont have leverage is that we dont have a u s russian relationship it has been adrift
3607103 its easy to say something belligerent about russia im no friend of vladimir putin and cheap shots about tough talk are all well and fine but what are you doing to actually make the situation better
3607104 this type of bluster is fairly counterproductive because it is a bluff theres nothing we can do about this
3607105 it has become a race to be see who can be the tougher i cant see anybody suddenly stepping back and becoming a voice of moderation and calling for calm
3607106 i believe that we need to create a special committee in the u s senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan
3607107 i still believe that we need to establish a bipartisan truman committee with subpoena power to exercise the oversight that these abuses demand
3607108 we only won two games last season but our goal is to be more competitive we lost four games we were either tied or leading in the 4th quarter now the challenge this year will be able to get over those humps and win those games
3607109 i feel he is pretty good back there hes real smart throws the ball really good
3607110 hes a pretty good athlete he was a starter second half of the year last year he is really impressing me looking forward to him leading our team
3607111 its going be a great time i think people will be surprised with what lewis county does
3607112 i think a lot of teams are going to under estimate us cause we only won two games last year so we going to go out there and show up
3607113 when the people find that they can vote themselves money that will herald the end of the republic
3607114 it shows that if you protect these animals then they can recover
3607115 im encouraged by the fact that several of the large whale species that had been in trouble for a long time have shown steady increases over recent decades
3607116 humpbacks have really shown an ability to recover strongly from extremely intensive hunting
3607117 it takes a while for conservationists to build up the confidence that it is a real signal of recovery and not a short term variation
3607118 it is a political question and it will be answered in a political form
3607119 i think it is really important to stress that the red list is not about whether a given species can be exploited
3607120 its simply about looking at the status of these animals and giving people some idea where they are now in relation to where they used to be
3607121 the trouble is that the nets that cause the most trouble the entangling nets that are unselective in what they catch are still being used
3607122 i think we are just seeing the start of the effects of climate change in the oceans another big problem is noise from sonar which we dont fully understand yet
3607123 preventing deliberate harm of that species has been ongoing for nearly a century and has been pretty effective
3607124 but the numbers that are killed in ship strikes and become entangled in lines from lobster and crab traps are preventing the population which is not very big in the first place recovering
3607125 how you stop or reduce that is a real challenge
3607126 the data deficient category is pretty large for cetaceans probably surprisingly large to many people
3607127 it is the species that live far offshore that are found in less developed parts of the world that in many cases we dont have a clue about how many there are
3607128 put your cat out and turn your alarm on dumb arse
3607129 please use whatever security you have and it may be as simple as locking the back door or remembering to activate the alarm when you go out
3607130 when you are off to bed or just watching television remember to lock the back door
3607131 take the hint and remember fred flintstone and the tvnz cat when youve put the cat out lock the door
3607132 recent files read entry via unlocked rear door entry via unlocked garage window entry via lounge window the list goes on
3607133 of all the animals man is the only one that is cruel he is the only one that inflicts pain for the pleasure of doing it
3607134 out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls the most massive characters are seared with scars
3607135 its not so important who starts the game but who finishes it
3607136 crime butchers innocence to secure a prize and innocence struggles with all its might against the attempts of crime
3607137 there were 33 processions today people were angry especially because of what happened yesterday there were four incidents of firing in srinagar city while forces opened fire at three other places we have exhibited maximum restraint two of our sub divisional police officers including a young ips officer an sho and 192 police and paramilitary force personnel were injured the protestors burnt three of our vehicles and damaged 33 other government vehicles

3607150 to be very careful and sensitive these days the russians are selling many arms to iran and syria and there is no need to offer them an excuse to sell even more advanced weapons
3607151 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers

3607154 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3607155 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3607156 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3607157 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3607158 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3607159 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3607160 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3607161 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3607162 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3607163 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3607164 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3607165 in august 1924 the small nation of georgia occupied by soviet russia since 1921 rose up against soviet rule on sept 16 1924
3607166 unlikely was an understatement georgians did not enjoy freedom again until 1991
3607167 the free and independent social democratic state of georgia will always remain in my memory as a classic example of an imperialist small nation both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
3607168 in the hope of avoiding a proliferation of an unpredictable number of small states the international community in its collective wisdom decreed that it would recognize only the ussrs constituent union republics and would thus not give any encouragement to the yearning for self determination that characterized some ethnic minorities living in regions endowed with only lower level autonomy according to the soviet administrative system such as the autonomous republic of abkhazia and the autonomous region of south ossetia both lower status entities within the union republic of soviet georgia it was a huge irony that in adopting this stance the west was effectively enshrining the divisions created for his fiefdom by none other than the soviet dictator iosep besarionis dze dzhughashvili a georgian known to the wider world as joseph vissarionovich stalin
3607169 had the soviet union collapsed during the first decade of its existence in the 1920s before abkhazia was reduced in status by fiat of stalin in february 1931 from being a fully fledged republic which entered the transcaucasian federation on 13 december 1922 in treaty alliance with georgia to that of an autonomous republic within georgia and had the then league of nations adopted the same principle of recognition later practiced by its successor the united nations then abkhazia would for decades have enjoyed independence and membership in its own right of the said international community
3607170 the aggressive politics of the government of georgia towards abkhazia occasioned extreme displeasure among the local abkhazian armenian russian greek and a significant proportion of the kartvelian peoples which actually helped to facilitate the establishment of soviet power in the region on march 4th 1921
3607171 as a deliverance from the repression and meddling of the georgian republic
3607172 the politics of this state was quite accurately characterized by one of its eminent activists the jurist internationalist zurab avalov avalishvili in his book the independence of georgia in international politics 1918 1921 paris 1924 he remarked at the start of 1921 georgia had in the person of its government and in the shape of the constituent assembly a simple creature of party organization georgian democracy 1917 1921 a form of social democratic dictatorship i e of the right wing of marxism was a period of preparation for the triumph in georgia of soviet dictatorship
3607173 when i was growing up i found that the main argument against laissez faire and for socialism was that socialism and communism were inevitable you cant turn back the clock
3607174 i know my life in january is going to be a lot better
3607175 its more than just having the republican stance on an issue its being able to effectively communicate it
3607176 mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3607177 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when the convention program will focus on renewing americas economy
3607178 this is the way it looked when the grill was brand new there is no deformation we expect any product fix to provide consistent results in this case the variable results give us concern
3607179 inspect the firebox periodically for signs of damage and avoid cooking on the highest heat setting called pow r zone
3607180 this is a test for measuring the concentration of proteins in the blood and how they differ from the normal state will tell us about the presence of disease
3607181 the method analyzes specific proteins and these proteins tell us what is going on with the patient in terms of the disease and how the disease is playing out on the patient
3607182 you could say it can catch it before because we see some elements of that where the test says positive but a mammogram gives a negative
3607183 any disease that has a need we will be able to find a blood test for that
3607184 mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3607185 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when the convention program will focus on renewing americas economy
3607186 going after your opponent for being of the world seemed a bit jarring a bit odd
3607187 their campaign really seems pretty out of touch with what the american people want to see and hear during the olympics
3607188 theyre using a gigantic stage to make their national case against obama
3607189 it doesnt seem to be causing any uproar they may have guessed right
3607190 focused on ensuring that voters have the best information possible to make an informed decision on election day
3607191 i will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3607192 unlike barack obama harley owners appreciate open roads and open markets
3607193 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3607194 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3607195 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3607196 everyone knows the next one could be ukraine and then poland all of europe should be here now
3607197 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3607198 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3607199 old times cnn his country is seeking details on what started the fighting united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3607200 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3607201 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3607202 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3607203 the blog poetry amp popular culture just covered a copyright conflict involving the grateful dead and j t duttons young adult novel freaked which harperteen is publishing early next year the novel is about a 15 year old kid obsessed with the grateful dead

3607239 we hope this will attract even more tourists to bedford as now not only they can fly and jump in the same day but the view from the top of the tunnel is awesome
3607240 we have had a lot of interest from people who want a bit of a james bond experience themselves
3607241 now not only can they try flying in the wind tunnel just as daniel craig did but they can also jump off the top you cant do a combined experience like this anywhere else at the moment

3607244 these allegations are totally unfounded and george is so sad and hurt and broken up over it
3607245 anyone can make allegations to get temporary custody orders george is squeaky clean there are no skeletons in his closet
3607246 he is a great dad and is very hands on with the kids putting them to bed feeding them and spending time with them
3607247 hes retired while pam is out of town 60 days a year commentating so he looks after them
3607248 pam didnt care about his age when they had the kids so she shouldnt now
3607249 george wants full custody of the children but he also wants pam involved in bringing up the kids

3607254 the john bull character was that of a drinking man hard headed down to earth averse to intellectualism fond of dogs horses ale and country sports during the napoleonic wars john bull became the national symbol of freedom of loyalty to king and country and of resistance to french aggression he was the ordinary man in the street who would fight napoleon with his bare hands if necessary by the 1800s he was seen as a more assertive figure in domestic politics as well prepared to criticise the royal family and the government giving those outside the traditional political process a voice john bull became so familiar that his name frequently appeared in books plays periodical titles and as a brand name or trademark although frequently used through world war ii john bull has been seen less often since the 1950s as uncle sam is the iconic representation of the united states so john bull is the personification of the character of the english honest generous straightforward with a zest for life and ready to stand up and fight for what he believes in

3607502 the nsw housing environment has been at particularly low levels for a prolonged period due to the compound effects of taxes protracted approval processes and interest rate rises
3607503 these factors are structural in character and other than possibly interest rates unlikely to change in the short term
3607504 whilst short term issues such as affordability purchaser confidence and investor activity can cause more volatile short term cycles long term prospects for residential property development are strongly linked to underlying supply and demand
3607505 the current cycle has resulted in a major shortfall in housing supply relative to underlying demand
3607506 underlying demand is determined by factors such as net immigration levels birth rates etc and remains fundamentally strong
3607507 a significant proportion of this increase has been by way of development agreements with minimal upfront investment
3607508 the increase in its developments pipeline positions the company well for the next growth cycle in the housing sector

3607752 conrad jantjes is on present form the no 1 fullback it is worrying that people make decisions with their heart to give someone montgomery his 100thttest cap
3607753 i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
3607754 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby that peter has spoken of
3607755 it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands
3607756 is the team that has been selected of such a nature that it will ensure the support of most south africans
3607757 we cannot repeat the cycle of the white era we must build for 2011
3607758 it is easy to fall into a comfort zone peter should be reminded of his mandate
3607759 its not all about transformation but it transformation is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year
3607760 a nightmare is much more intense than a bad dream it can arouse feelings of fear horror and distress it replicates our deepest fears and can reflect the different types of stresses we face in our waking world
3607761 nightmarish thoughts such as losing your job being homeless falling and being chased are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3607762 for example dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life the attacker or falling in the dream represents the emotion of fear and anxiety
3607763 its no wonder gordon brown and alistair darling are making a special appearance in our nightmares at the moment both symbolise the fears we are facing in todays economy
3607764 in athens we were bystanders watching a great swim meet this time its an even better swim meet and we have people in the finals

3607767 does cozad have the authority to audit computer systems security and software
3607768 remember were only serving basic spectator food what youd find at any ballpark
3607769 bocog and its partners work hard to provide spectators with delicious high quality and healthy food
3607770 its all right of course its not as good as the food outside
3607771 i try to eat the local food as much as possible
3607772 chinese food is really good and they could have just sold that

3607784 analog ntsc will live on with analog cable vhs and composite s video connections in the usa analog ntsc and pal will live on for decades in the rest of world row
3607785 id suggest either 72 fps 3x24p or 96 fps 4x24p as a new world standard there is no reason to obsolete all current equipment unless we are moving to something better
3607786 then why all the rush to interpolated 120hz 100hz pal for home movie display
3607787 live big screen video using hand held cameras would be inadequate at 48p
3607788 is that why they all walk out on 60 hz hdtv oh wait they dont
3607789 i thought the audience walked out on the high film frame rate because it was too realistic now youre saying they cant tell the difference must have been an audience of supermen eh
3607790 the point where you cant tell the difference anymore is somewhere over 72 fps
3607791 if weve got unhappy drivers it means weve got happy fans this is a speedway not a slow way
3607792 in this new movie we have quite a car chase through philadelphia thats a real thrill ride
3607793 we have some of the hottest coolest and fastest tricked out cars ever assembled for tv

3607795 effective and innovative program which contribute to and enhance county government in the united states
3607796 the county strongly supports the proactive work that ny saan and the livable community connection do
3607797 they are helping us to better serve seniors right now and we are also using them as building blocks to develop projects for the future
3607798 i have worked for several tutoring organizations and found gemm learning to be an essential step and maybe the missing step in the development of struggling children i joined gemm because i believe that the innovative science backed technology and the progressive philosophy create an environment which allows all children to achieve their potential
3607799 we are excited to add andrew to the gemm learning team
3607800 his passion and experience will serve scarsdale well and we anticipate great results
3607801 the super bowl may be 2 500 miles away but it might as well be here as it fills up every avenue of the casino people actually camp out the night before just to get a seat in here
3607802 people want this game you couldnt ask for better teams this is the best match up this will be the wildest craziest of them all chicago and indianapolis are two teams that belong to the entire country so everybody comes out for them rather than just a local favorite
3607803 we take substantial bets and the numbers are truly fantastic we dont reveal individuals or the size of their bets but those numbers wouldnt surprise me around town we have just 60 props and because everybody thinks they know football the margin of victory becomes the most popular
3607804 the 60s and 70s were an exciting time in the music industry and its a pleasure to record these artists using 21st century technology so their fans can enjoy their classic hits with todays quality
3607805 rock and roll tv4u com is a broadband channel concept that gives the millions of fans of these great artists the chance to enjoy their performances on video after all of these years you can think of this as a baby boomer mtv style channel
3607806 weve enjoyed making music videos of almost 100 top songs so far and were just getting started
3607807 well be making the majority of these videos in las vegas and henderson
3607808 but the problem is when you cant afford it i can afford to gamble i didnt kill myself when i lost two and half million dollars i like to gamble and im not going to quit
3607809 i have owned the trademark moneybag logo for over 25 years i have used it on my magazines book imprint record company and a few other areas until i met jason dussault i held off on really going out into the marketplace in the street wear line it has to do with finding a kindred spirit and jason is it he and i share a passion for only doing things in life that mean something as a teenager he was a huge kiss fan and spent a lot of time not only dressing like kiss but also drawing my character all over his fashion books so his teenage dream of meeting me not only became a reality but we hit it off with a great business idea together we intend on creating cutting edge in your face fashions the moneybag line at long last is becoming a reality
3607810 hed been well educated we brought him here to sandown on saturday morning and gave him a canter around
3607811 steven king was here to ride him he likes the horse he said hes a lot like his father
3607812 as far as hes concerned hes a ready made racehorse so it worked out terrific
3607813 hes only a little fellow but hes nice and relaxed he does everything right it looks like he might have a bit of a future
3607814 hes always shown us a bit but until these kinds of horses race you cant get a really good guide
3607815 obviously he can perform on wet tracks which is a bonus and it might be a wet spring so who knows

3607829 created reviewed signed and filed in the district of columbia and a substantial portion of stevens scheme to conceal occurred in or around the district of columbia
3607830 it is simply unacceptable for top government officials to be unaccountable for such a gross abuse of their power
3607831 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet

3607841 while the congressman believes spending time with the delegates and the party faithful is productive he is focused on campaigning in his district and ensuring that we keep nevada red
3607842 i would definitely say that people arent as excited about going to minneapolis as they were about going to new york city
3607843 minneapolis is a nice city but it doesnt quite have the environment and reputation of a new york city and i think 2004 was a unique convention and a lot of it had to do with where it was
3607844 i have a lot of friends that are just not going that have gone in years past
3607845 we certainly werent alone a lot of venues hadnt heard anything and were kind of wondering what might of happened
3607846 a live concert featuring exclusive performances and collaborations by marquee artists
3607847 as of right now theres not an equal amount of events but were working to get it that way
3607848 were confident that were going to have a great national convention with enthusiastic participation from republicans nationwide who are working hard every day to elect john mccain in november
3607849 were not having a rock concert at a stadium but yet republicans are looking at good polling data right now theyre looking at a candidate whos getting his sea legs right now
3607850 i really think there is growing enthusiasm about what john mccain is doing and saying
3607851 why are they taking care of school uniforms now when they should be discussing how we should get books in the classroom and be discussing our education
3607852 current turmoil abroad has created uncertainty among the major international houses providing us with opportunities that were simply not available over the past four years he said
3607853 our conservative growth and stability combined with the fact that we are australian owned has resulted in far more enquiries from senior bankers and stockbrokers
3607854 the nsw housing environment has been at particularly low levels for a prolonged period due to the compound effects of taxes protracted approval processes and interest rate rises
3607855 these factors are structural in character and other than possibly interest rates unlikely to change in the short term
3607856 whilst short term issues such as affordability purchaser confidence and investor activity can cause more volatile short term cycles long term prospects for residential property development are strongly linked to underlying supply and demand
3607857 the current cycle has resulted in a major shortfall in housing supply relative to underlying demand
3607858 underlying demand is determined by factors such as net immigration levels birth rates etc and remains fundamentally strong
3607859 a significant proportion of this increase has been by way of development agreements with minimal upfront investment
3607860 the increase in its developments pipeline positions the company well for the next growth cycle in the housing sector

3607893 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3607894 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3607895 the end of the military operation does not mean russia has shown leniency to saakashvili
3607896 there can be no return to the status quo that existed before the incursion of georgian forces in south ossetia which is now insisted upon by a mortally frightened saakashvili and his western protector
3607897 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored

3608020 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3608021 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3608022 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3608023 if god hates anyone based on what they prefer then god himself is a loser and should gtfo
3608024 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3608025 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3608026 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3608027 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3608028 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3608029 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3608030 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3608031 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3608032 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3608033 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3608034 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3608038 the problem with that was pool costs started to go up travel started to get expensive and the government funding went down you put all those things together and you couldnt attract the top coaches in the 70s and 80s we had some of the best coaches in the world and what happened was they left or retired and we couldnt replace them
3608039 he was fantastic on deck coach and he built some excellent swimming programs
3608040 but he was also so excited about the possibility of coming back to canada and he just stood out amongst all the other candidates

3608043 i have to have fun with it or ill turn in to britney spears shave my head and go totally crazy
3608044 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3608045 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars

3608094 well since i hadnt heard from you about that since the first time we talked
3608095 oh but we want you to come he totally likes you
3608096 come on hes only in town with my boyfriend for the weekend
3608097 one of my girlfriends just got un engaged so were having a girls night tomorrow
3608098 i dont know yet i guess wherever she feels like we might just stay in if she wants
3608099 well if you go out afterward will you call me
3608100 let me just give you my number and you can call me if you do okay
3608101 i find that attending industry related social functions conferences and even my neighbors cocktail parties help me find new ways of growing my company
3608102 by asking the right people the right questions youll find that you can learn new things and different strategies for your online casino firm that you may not have thought of before
3608103 in the case of our online casino marketing venture we initially started out with a simple website and then slowly grew as sales increased
3608104 then the website expanded into a data warehouse essentially a store of all things related to our marketing campaigns which allowed us to study and refine subsequent efforts
3608105 ive seen companies with nearly everything perfect budget great it good distribution but a terrible working dynamic between the employees though the online casino product makes it to store shelves the people working within the company feel miserable unappreciated and unmotivated
3608106 starting up any online casino business is difficult in our case it took about 6 months of planning a year of fund raising and then another 6 months of building infrastructure before we made our first sale
3608107 if you walk up to someone and say ive got a great online casino business idea would you contribute 100k theyll probably laugh and consider you a lunatic but if you approach someone and say look i have this great idea and my plan is the following it will reassure an anxious investor that things will move forward with thought and purpose

3608121 via dit bedrijf buitenreclame kun je tegen lage kosten een stad laten vol zetten hangen met pakkende 911 zapruder info het idee is om op 9 11 een flink aantal van deze borden te hebben staan mijn inzet is wederom rond de 100 euro is dit idee wel waardig of zijn er ook voor dit idee maar 2 mensen te vinden die willen mee doen actie
3608122 9 11 kan me aan me reet roesten ik spendeer liever me geld aan een dag waarop onze regering praat en of beslist over een vingerafdrukken wet afghanistan of chipregeling ofzo

3608125 waarom probeer je het niet via willem middelkoop of andere libertari rs
3608126 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3608127 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3608128 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3608129 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3608130 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3608131 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3608132 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3608133 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3608134 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3608135 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3608136 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3608137 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3608138 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3608139 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3608140 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3608141 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3608142 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3608143 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3608144 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3608145 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3608146 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3608147 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3608148 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3608149 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3608150 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3608151 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

3608156 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3608157 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3608158 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3608159 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3608160 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3608161 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3608162 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3608163 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3608164 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3608165 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3608166 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3608167 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3608168 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3608169 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3608170 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3608171 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3608172 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3608173 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3608174 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3608175 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3608176 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3608177 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3608178 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3608179 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3608180 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3608181 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3608182 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3608183 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3608184 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3608185 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3608186 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3608187 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3608188 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3608189 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3608190 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3608191 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3608192 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3608193 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3608194 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3608195 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3608196 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3608197 who are open to doing something on the production side
3608198 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3608199 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3608200 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3608201 why pray are you stranger preparing to offer a polluted sacrifice to diana go and bathe yourself first in running water the tiber is flowing down there at the bottom of the valley
3608202 for audi safety and performance have always gone hand in hand our cars are engineered to offer the best not just in crash protection but in preventing traffic accidents altogether
3608203 with the launch of the audi q7 tdi clean diesel in 2009 american suv buyers will have even more options from which to choose for safety as well as fuel economy convenience and performance
3608204 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3608205 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3608206 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3608207 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3608208 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3608209 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3608210 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3608211 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3608212 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3608213 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3608214 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3608215 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3608216 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3608217 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3608218 learning occurs when all students have equity and equal access to and an opportunity for mastery of a rigorous academic curriculum
3608219 they need to be able to navigate the political waters while also creating a solid infrastructure so that teachers can effectively teach and students can effectively learn

3608227 we waited for this for so long and hes there and i cant wait for this to end
3608228 its like a whole year preparing for all this and now its here and its crazy
3608229 we work with businesses to convert landscaping and revert to reclaimed water
3608230 so finally its time on monday august 18 chaq mol and i will enter the studio together with producer

3608232 hey kid sit down and make vertical lines or i am going to show you a picture of lester
3608233 its not just a very big city in this world it is in many senses the iconic city it represents western democracy
3608234 were going to be adding cameras as we go forward
3608235 i dont think its hyperbole to call this big brotherish
3608236 the new york city police department is creating a huge computer database of the movement of everyone in a vehicle in manhattan
3608237 it is always a balance between freedoms to come and go between civil liberties and security and i think we pretty much have the balance pretty much right
3608238 i guess i would feel safer in light of everything that happened
3608239 the city has been under a lot of you know pressures and stuff
3608240 i dont know want everybody or someone knowing where im at 24 hours a day
3608241 why is my designer doing a different challenge than everybody else
3608242 no heidi no he she was too talented to go this soon
3608243 create a look that can go from day to night
3608244 one of you will be named the winner and one of you will be out
3608245 im going to turn him in and its going to get ugly
3608246 thing very literally and pitches a black and leopard print dress not unlike what shes wearing as she sews the thing
3608247 look at the utility meters then go look at the mailboxes then go look at what is recorded
3608248 someone who did the work himself and didnt get paid
3608249 they have all these unique things that stand out that say ok this unit should not be here
3608250 the reason for the order is that your building at 1 amory st is supposed to be a single family home not a three family building
3608251 in addition your building at 3 amory st is supposed to be a two family not a three family you must convert these buildings back to their legal status
3608252 as you probably know we have a somewhat pervasive problem with buildings in the city that have been illegally chopped up without proper permits
3608253 the function was to look at the unit and see if it could be made legal without a lot of headache
3608254 it kept going back and forth nobody wanted to commit to signing a piece of paper to condone it
3608255 he called and said i just want to know what i can do i am trying to sell this
3608256 is the plumbing done right we dont know even now we dont make people tear up walls to look at plumbing
3608257 but i basically put my reputation as a code officer on the line
3608258 i believe that if we issue the permit knowing that this is supposed to be a two family instead of a three family we are essentially sanctioning the illegal third unit
3608259 typical illustration of the general code enforcement problem right the problem is not the bad man ordinance but the affirmative defenses of estoppels administrative gloss selective enforcement systematic non enforcement etc
3608260 i also dont know how these things were handled in the past
3608261 i guess that you could say the problem is that they werent handled at all
3608262 if i wanted to take polls i would have applied to the harris organization instead
3608263 first of all i find myself in some interesting company
3608264 the fact of the matter is that the project has changed dramatically
3608265 i dont see any concrete evidence of the roadway stimulating the downtown no matter how far into the future you look
3608266 i would argue that 30 years of discussion is enough and we should make a decision one way or another
3608267 we should be sitting here tonight talking about the reconstruction of the broad street parkway not the initial build
3608268 i think its very important because its part of our history
3608269 if you take a look at downtown weve got many buildings that are old and that have been around for a long time its part of the reason why the city of nashua is the way it is and this bell is part of that history i think its terrific to restore it back to main street
3608270 it really is a bell that encapsulates a lot of the history of nashua
3608271 to me it seemed like a great project just to get done for the city of nashua to enjoy to me thats what made me really jump on it because i know what this bell means to the city since 1863 this has been a very important bell
3608272 if it were not for mr stellos supporting this project we would not have pulled it off
3608273 its mostly for the old greek people our fathers our grandfathers our grandmothers that came to this country as immigrants
3608274 the bell was always in the building it was like an alarm clock if you want to call it that
3608275 daf r sind die inhaltlichen differenzen auf bundesebene einfach zu gro
3608276 on the basis of the thorough probe that we conducted in 2003 2004 i can say with confidence that neither the pakistan army nor any of the past governments of pakistan was ever involved or had any knowledge of abdul qadirs proliferation activities the show was completely and entirely abdul qadirs
3608277 dr aq khan had saved the country from a major crisis by taking full responsibility for the nuclear proliferation issue dr khan has taken full responsibility himself in the national interests
3608278 accepted the cabinet suggestion and pardoned dr khan he also said
3608279 he is a free man but he is not allowed to go abroad

3608320 i dont regard myself particularly as a photojournalist im a documentary photographer the idea of my work is to try put my finger on the zeitgeist of whats happening thats constantly changing and shifting im not interested in photographing things that are disappearing although ive engaged in a slight bit of nostalgia im interested in things as they are now
3608321 ive been doing a set of pictures called luxury wealth to me is as much to me the front line as poverty traditionally was
3608322 im not waiting to be assigned i go to places i want to go and see how they fit in if i wait for the phone to ring for me to go to the places i want to go its not going to happen so i determine where i want to go and then try to get the magazines to help
3608323 another story i did last october was about millionaires in moscow i did the gulf art fair all these things in the end have been quite beneficial to me in terms of sales and theyre constantly adding to my portfolio of work its a big jigsaw puzzle im trying to work out as we go along about my relationship to the world we live in
3608324 its a highly competitive market clearly one of the things that potentially distinguishes you is that you have a known voice in photography picture editors like to commission new exciting photographers theyll take that risk of course its not easy if it was easy then everybody would be at it there are more magazines now than ever before but they have to be filled with something i agree that im in a better position than most im in a very privileged position and it has taken years to get there

3608772 it was not an easy decision for me and i dont think i could have taken it before the team was selected actually it would be very difficult for me to complete my examination in future if i skip it this time because we have a number of series after the australia tour
3608773 i think its very important for anybody to complete his examination we have been informed that nafees opted out due to the sudden announcement of his university exam schedules thus we have no choice other than picking nazimuddin no other opener is available as junaid siddiqui is also out of form

3608799 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3608800 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3608801 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3608802 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3608803 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3608804 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3608805 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3608806 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3608807 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3608808 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3608809 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3608810 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3608811 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3608812 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3608932 the term we use to describe our strategy toward terrorists is important because it affects what kinds of forces you use

3608944 anil ambani resigned from the board on july 18 2005 and the demerged companies including rnrl were handed over to adag on february 7 2006 reliance industries had signed an agreement on january 12 2006 with demerged companies when they were under its control this is breach of trust as ril was acting as trustee for the demerged companies a trustee cannot sign an agreement to his benefit
3608945 there is no dispute on the existence of an mou or the family agreement in fact their mother kokilaben had issued a media statement and it was published by ril on june 18 2005 the ril board took kokilabens statement on record and decided to reorganise reliance industriess claim that mou is in the private domain and ril has no knowledge of the contents of mou and hence mou not being binding on ril is not correct
3608946 a piece of trash as far as reliance industries has submitted wrong affidavit in court saying mukesh ambani did not participate in the june 18 board meeting the minutes of the board meeting showed his presence in fact he was the chairman of the meeting he mukesh ambani cannot claim that he is not aware of the mou if mukesh ambani knows the entire company knows about it as per the doctrine of identification which is well recognised by indian courts mukesh ambanis knowledge of the mou shall be deemed to be the knowledge of

3608952 hauntingly enigmatic poetic and understated portrait of rootlessness apathy and disconnection
3608953 dreamlike temporal and existential ambiguity within a realistic verite styled camerawork the film was shot exclusively in digital video through alternating point of views narrative ellipses and surreal encounters
3608954 visual incongruence that innately reflect s the adrift young protagonists dissociation from their oppressively mundane and self induced reality
3608955 as the red jellyfish navigates through its new and unfamiliar environment its plight reflects the uncertain and treacherous path of the films young antiheroes foundering in the impersonality of technology instinctually searching
3608956 from various angles with results that range from the blackly comic jun ichikawas tadon to chikuwa to the brutally grotesque takashi miikes ichi the killer
3608957 sets his inquiry in a world several degrees removed from ours
3608958 do i exist the unbearable blankness of being in kiyoshi kurosawas bright future
3608959 too self sufficient and formless to be assigned a single significance the jellyfish nevertheless reflects or absorbs both of the central characters as well as embodying the relationship between them
3608960 lost aimless alienated young men and women usually hostile or at least indifferent to the adult world
3608961 sense of self definition or engagement with the world a feeling of existential out of placeness
3608962 thats just its nature im sure you two will get along fine
3608963 his amazing self sacrifice and utter selflessness in accepting the role of kichizo in realm of the senses 1976 and thereby earning the status of the first actor in japanese film to receive actual shall we say oral bliss on film
3608964 maybe i should just put the bright future on hold until im ready to not understand what it means
3608965 its clear the director intended to make a movie thats hard to get a grip on but i have to wonder if the audience will get anything at all or if theyll only feel a little sting as it slips through their fingers
3608966 kurosawa himself has said that the sarcasm tinted katakana of the title akarui mirai is in fact not sarcastic at all he really is trying to show us a bright future albeit bright from the point of view of the younger generation not the adults
3608967 who could take a jellyfish out of a home aquarium and turn it into a metaphor worthy of godzilla
3608968 quietly creepy story with a hint of politics and a wealth of shivers
3608969 spell by drawing out the horror of everyday existence bit by bit and then tossing in some otherworldly weirdness
3608970 with his droopy posture and dead eyes just looks blank unplugged from the human race as harmless and animated as a houseplant
3608971 dreamlike plot winds this way and that as luxuriantly unhurried as that jellyfish
3608972 one of the pleasures of mr kurosawas films is how casually he tosses in ideas about contemporary life the state of the family the place of technology all while steadily shredding your nerves
3608973 kurosawa has always explored metropolitan anomie to chilling and profound effect
3608974 and in bright future he may have hit upon a perfect synecdoche of its manifestations
3608975 this time speaking to the incompatibilities of natural and artificial environments
3608976 sealed off from one another the sea creatures and the city pose no mutual threat but commingled the effects are disastrous with a spate of civilian attacks making the nightly news
3608977 kurosawa repeatedly puts the jellyfish out there as a grand signifier just waiting to be explained but never follows through thus allowing for any number of interpretations
3608978 his mise en sc ne and cutting surprise and often transcend the stylistics of his historic exemplars
3608979 the phenomenological position that a persons identity is shaped not so much by what one has done but rather by what one hopes to become and when an individual cannot see who he will be or worse is reluctant to even imagine a future self positively or negatively then he is in the deepest sense nothing kurosawa obviously sees this as a problem that condemns the individual and the collective to oblivion a terrible existential understanding of being
3608980 when an individual sees the future as the temporal state that gives one meaning and begins to take the steps necessary to actualize it there are going to be growing pains
3608981 in the 11th hour his film diverts its gaze to an odd youth gang outfitted in starched white che t shirts rousing themselves from disillusioned torpor and in a stirring traveling shot hunting for relevance and confrontation in the streets as a waving flag of anarchic will it evokes the codas of discreet charm of the bourgeoisie as an ending it leaves you speechless
3608982 a meditation on a country whose youth is spiritually destitute in the aftermath of the bursting of the economic bubble and the 1995 sarin gas attacks by the aum shinrikyo cult
3608983 exerts a gnawing dread that slowly turns to something faintly like hope
3608984 f or a film about apocalyptic generational rebellion bright future is perversely quiet
3608985 the nanny cam had a lot and nothing to do with the dissolution of the marriage it did amplify things but obivously a lot more was there
3608986 someday i know that i was meant to be somewhere else with someone else
3608987 you basically date me without the sex so youre missing the good part
3608988 youd be back on sunday worry on monday and then tuesday
3608989 hopeful someday everythings going to change im going to find that 1 that completes me and everything will be all good and ill forget about a person that ive tried to never forget this entire time and it will all be worth it
3608990 the world is awful nothing will ever change fuck everybody there is no changing the inevitable my life is going to be awful forever there is no changing it
3608991 oh those are a sonuvagun to get off a sonuvagun
3608992 wasting hours of your life with a stranger only to spend hours on the phone after with your friends talking about how you are going back to hoetown because the only people who date are douchebags
3608993 theres nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come
3608994 i addressed the un and the russian ambassador and wanted them to know that the us and president bush wants russia to know that the days of overthrowing leaders by military means are over in
3608995 the reason i care so little about myself is because i care so much for you
3608996 how depressing is that moment that moment when you give up
3608997 someday youll say something you wish you could take back
3608998 things sold by the gram are always more exciting than things sold by the pound
3608999 if youre grown enough to talk back youre grown enough to get an ass whooping
3609000 you gotta take chances for the things you care about
3609001 pay no attention to the men behind the barbed curtain
3609002 some of us worked themselves sick and someone did not strain himself at all
3609003 it is very insulting this person thinks only of himself
3609004 you know who i am speaking of you all saw i think every athlete in the final of the olympic games should be in a special mood and in principle all of us were except one person i find it difficult to talk about
3609005 my foot was hurting and i could have been injured
3609006 he started to rip on kostya pluzhnikov who couldnt do his dismount on rings i say this is wrong kostya made a small mistake but still we beat germany on rings by a half point using pluzhnikovs score three times we had a real chance to move into the top three i blew up then and there i simply did not have words
3609007 after our performances on rings he told us theres no point in still fighting already i understood that he was not going to fight up to the end everyone else kept fighting but for him the competition ended he has simply gone and spat on us all right god sees all
3609008 i never expected that this would happen meaning it was not our destiny to be sixth we will try further we are young guys there is more ahead
3609009 eigentlich nicht davon ausgegangen ist dass die sp so schnell ihre linie ndert
3609010 il consumo di morfina e pi in generale di oppiacei mostrano che il loro utilizzo bench aumentato ancora inadeguato rispetto alle esigenze terapeutiche dei pazienti e in particolare litalia si colloca tra i paesi europei al penultimo posto
3609011 ill just have that leaf of lettuce over there and uh that bag of potato chips
3609012 i know dude im so hungover too did you sleep with andrew or did i just dream that oh sorry gotta go see you crammed with 10 other people smoking on the 11 th this morning and i have to be on time for the bus
3609013 is he the god of the jews only is he not also of the gentiles yes of the gentiles also
3609014 then peter opened his mouth and said of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him
3609015 for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law
3609016 knowing this that the law is not made for a righteous man but for the lawless and disobedient for the ungodly and for sinners for unholy and profane for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers for manslayers for whoremongers for them that defile themselves with mankind for menstealers for liars for perjured persons and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine
3609017 this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind
3609018 who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness
3609019 and to this agree the words of the prophets as it is written after this i will return and will build again the tabernacle of david which is fallen down and i will build again the ruins thereof and i will set it up
3609020 that the residue of men might seek after the lord and all the gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the lord who doeth all these things
3609021 and he said unto them the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath
3609022 but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates
3609023 blessed is the man that doeth this and the son of man that layeth hold on it that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and keepeth his hand from doing any evil
3609024 neither let the son of the stranger that hath joined himself to the lord speak saying the lord hath utterly separated me from his people neither let the eunuch say behold i am a dry tree
3609025 also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the lord to serve him and to love the name of the lord to be his servants every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and taketh hold of my covenant even them will i bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people the lord god which gathereth the outcasts of israel saith yet will i gather others to him beside those that are gathered unto him
3609026 then paul stood up and beckoning with his hand said men of israel and ye that fear god give audience
3609027 and from thence to philippi which is the chief city of that part of macedonia and a colony and we were in that city abiding certain days and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side where prayer was wont to be made and we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted thither
3609028 and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the jews and the greeks gentiles
3609029 for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him being read in the synagogues every sabbath day
3609030 and a mixed multitude went up also with them and flocks and herds even very much cattle
3609031 one law shall be to him that is homeborn and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you
3609032 and the whole congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and aaron in the wilderness
3609033 then said the lord unto moses behold i will rain bread from heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day that i may prove them whether they will walk in my law or no
3609034 and it came to pass that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather and they found none and the lord said unto moses how long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws
3609035 when they have a matter they come unto me and i judge between one and another and i do make them know the statutes of god and his laws
3609036 but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates
3609037 moreover concerning a stranger that is not of thy people israel but cometh out of a far country for thy names sake for they shall hear of thy great name and of thy strong hand and of thy stretched out arm when he shall come and pray toward this house hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for that all people of the earth may know thy name to fear thee as do thy people israel and that they may know that this house which i have builded is called by thy name
3609038 and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the lord
3609039 people care about each other by bringing people together it makes a difference
3609040 because weve been planning this now for the last three weeks and kind of immersed ourselves in this project you know were ready
3609041 we came up with an idea to do some fundraising i have twelve local artists who are going to painting chairs and then theyre going to be raffled off
3609042 our marketing team is really helping with the public relations and communications
3609043 weve been asked to come in and do some of the trim work maybe installing kitchen cabinets
3609044 its not always about those things that we often perceive as being heroic heroic is simply taking the time out of your life to change another persons life thats what i consider a hero
3609045 wir werden in br nn wohl wieder zu mischungen zur ckkehren die wir schon im fr hling in barcelona und katar verwendet haben
3609046 dabei handelt es sich um reifenkonstruktionen die ein etwas breiteres spektrum haben in dem sie gut funktionierten anders als zum beispiel die reifen die wir in laguna verwendet haben
3609047 bei uns ist dies konkret der reifen typ 20 der uns bereits in dieser saison erfolge gebracht hat
3609048 den vorderreifen werden wir an die anforderungen von br nn anpassen der neue asphalt in br nn ist f r das vorderrad sehr aggressiv das wissen wir nach den br nn tests im juni
3609049 grunds tzlich ist es das erste mal dass die motogp wm auf einem derartigen asphalt f hrt
3609050 daher m ssen die unterschiede zwischen mischungen so gering wie m glich sein die leute haben beim neuauftragen der asphaltschicht gute arbeit geleistet wir m ssen warten was die motogp piloten daraus machen ich denke die strecke wird dadurch auch schneller als in den jahren zuvor sein denn der alte asphalt war bereits in einem schlechten zustand

3609052 a general message from amphibians is that we may have little time to stave off a potential mass extinction

3609054 that night i thought the best topic is a journey to the southern seas
3609055 they thought he could reach the people with his voice
3609056 i still raise fish and help bring in the harvest
3609057 brother is sailing for the southern seas wishing him good health on his journey i light incense in his honour
3609058 they promised so i gave in i sat down to write a new song on the theme that night and finished it by midnight

3609060 the deep rooted politicisation of indias battle with terror can be understood by how the bharatiya janata party bjp the major right wing party has used political and religious tensions in jammu and kashmir during electoral battles over the past 20 years the manner in which the issue of illegal immigrants read bangladeshis muslims has been whipped up by them to polarise sentiments and win elections and now how the issue of recent terror attacks is likely to be used in future
3609061 it is these draconian laws that are causing terrorism in the country
3609062 if police officers kill innocent people in fake encounters and if this and other misuse happens on a large scale then the inevitable consequence of that is to turn ordinary people into terrorists
3609063 i dont think any law will have the slightest effect on curbing terrorism maja daruwala director of the commonwealth human rights initiative in india told ips
3609064 if the average policing is anything to go by the police depend mostly on tip offs they appear to have no other means at their disposal says daruwala
3609065 de politicised held to a professional standard and given internal management systems that are run on competent technology and skills not on patronage
3609066 the deeprooted politicisation of indias intelligence agencies in all blasts investigations has succeeded in investigations not leading to the guilty

3609070 his work revolves around the relationship between humans and their environment
3609071 when i first got to know him i found him really supportive it was very enriching for a young artist then because he shared his books and his knowledge of art outside singapore
3609072 i think that all senators and i include in that the liberal opposition as well as all minor parties will be looking closely at the data that abounds in this debate
3609073 i must say if they are looking closely at it they will see that it is a fairly consistent line of behaviour happening here which is fairly biased release of material from the industry
3609074 i dont believe that she is frozen out and we certainly are not at war
3609075 when rumor arises were going to need to address it and unfortunately we may need to address it before we can determine whether its true or not because its having impact as it was in this case
3609076 this was a game that potentially could have really been a major downer for us and we actually turned it around and made it a great win
3609077 it was definitely a huge game for us to pull it out in the end and get the win
3609078 it would have been upsetting if the red sox lost

3609080 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3609081 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3609082 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3609083 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3609084 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3609085 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3609086 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3609087 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3609088 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3609089 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3609090 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3609091 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3609092 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3609093 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3609094 kami kira bukan terkatung katung tapi sedang diproses kami bertekad 2008 ini akan dilanjutkan lagi pembahasan ranperda inisiatif transparansi dan partisipasi publik tersebut persoalannya komisi menilai bikin perda jangan asal asalan harus mengena dan bisa diimplementasikan
3609095 ini yang belum duduk dan butuh kajian mendetail kalau hanya sekedar gagagh gagahan kami kira ranperda itu tinggal copy paste saja dari kota atau kabupaten lain yang sudah mempunyai perda transparansi
3609096 tunggu saja untuk ini berganti pun pimpinan komisi kita sepakat untuk meneruskannya tahun depan
3609097 terus terang ranperda yang kita gagas ini bukan untuk mengkerdilkan dinas pasar justru memberikan keleluasaan siapapun profesional yang akan mengelolanya untuk penataan dan pemeliharaan pasar yang cukup banyak di punyai kota padang
3609098 keinginan kita ranperda ini nantinya memang berdasar dan punya nilai akademis sehingga ada marwah dari perda iutu bukan asal bikin yang nanti seperti perda lain yang dinilai masyarakat mandul
3609099 pembahasan sudah memasuki tahap satu yaitu penampungan aspirasi bersama skpd terkait untuk menyatukan visi tapi karena keburu harus membahas apbdp kua pas dan apbd 2008 makanya ranperda ini terkatung
3609100 tinggal tahap konsultasi hukum serta pembahasan dengan pihak akademis tentang kelayakan perda tersebut
3609101 pihak komisi sudah merancang naskah akademis tapi beberapa kalangan mengatakan naskah tersebut harus melibatkan pakar akademis sedangkan biaya untuk itu tergolong mahal
3609102 saat ini masih banyak keluhan warga tentang pengelolaan sd dan smp sehingga merugikan masyarakat mulai dari pungutan liar hingga sistem belajar melalui perda tersebut nantinya akan diatur penataansd dan smp yang ideal serta penertiban pungutan liar dan kewenangan setiap komponen yang memiliki fungsi di jajaran pendidikan
3609103 saya kira keberadaan terminal dengan mobile penduduk kota yang cukup tinggi sudah sangat mendesak
3609104 alhamdulillah kita sudah bisa sejajar dengan kota lain yang memberikan tunjangan daerah kepada pnsnya
3609105 ternyata lewat kesepahaman dengan wali kota padang tahun depan semua pns di padang terima tunjada
3609106 seyogyanya tiap skpd dapat berjalan sesuai dengan tugas pokok dan fungsi tupoksi masing masing sudah ditetapkan dengan tetap memelihara koordinasi
3609107 allhamdulillah sampai sekarang respon masyarakat padang pada anggota dewan sangat positif terbukti selama tahun ini tak ada satu pun surat pengaduan menyangkut anggota dewan yang sampai keruang bk

3609109 saat ini bola berada di tangan dpp kita dpd red dalam hal ini masih menunggu keputusan dpp yang pasti tugas kita telah selesai mengajukan dua balon fauzi bahar dan yusman kasim ke dpw pks sumbar untuk seterusnya dilanjutkan ke tingkat dpp pks dua nama ini figur terbaik dari pks untuk memimpin kota padang 2008 2013
3609110 ke 15 nama ini sangat kecil kemungkinan untuk ditambah tapi besar peluang untuk dikurangi oleh pleno dpd pg padang hasil semua itu lalu diserahkan ke dpp kemungkinan lima pasang calon hasil dpp dipastikan turun akhir januari tahun depan
3609111 kita telah melakukan lobi secara intensif dengan sebuah partai namun partai tersebut masih belum menetapkan calon diperkirakan pada akhir januari atau awal februari 2008 dpc pd telah menentukan sikap dan siap mendeklarasikan calon kepala daerahnya
3609112 10 tokoh ini telah mengadakan pertemuan yang dibingkai silaturahmi dengan pengurus ppp padang namun kita belum menentukan balon yang akan diusung nantinya
3609113 pbb telah banyak melakukan komunikasi politik dengan berbagai partai semisal ppp dan partai demokrat dengan ppp kita telah menjalin komunikasi semenjak 1 5 tahun lalu pembicaraan intensif setidaknya telah dilaksanakan sebanyak 5 kali namun masih belum mengerucut pada satu titik kita memasang target enam bulan sebelum pelaksanaan pilkada calon kepala daerah dari pbb telah dideklarasikan
3609114 secara lisan kita telah melakukan pertemuan secara lisan dengan sejumlah partai tersebut namun masih perlu beberapa kajian lagi untuk menuju pendeklarasian
3609115 percuma saja kalau kita melakukan persiapan sekarang jika nantinya pengurus yang ada saat ini tidak lagi duduk pada kepengurusan berikutnya makanya kita bentuk dulu susunan kepengurusan dpc pdi p kota padang paling lambat bulan januari sudah terbentuk
3609116 kita butuh satu partai lagi untuk mengusung satu paket calon
3609117 dari asumsi itu tentu akan balon wali kota yang bermunculan dari 600 ribu pemilih yang diperkirakan calon perseorangan tentunya sudah harus bersiap siap dari sekarang sayang belum ada ketentuan yang mengatur proses pencalonannya
3609118 kita semua boleh bangga atas anugerah rekor muri yang diberikan kepada sepasan hbt padang marilah kita dukung dan lestarikan sepasan ini karena sepasan ini merupakan salah satu bagian kesenian yang unik dari kebudayaan bangsa
3609119 dengan karnaval sepasan ini selain menampilkan kekompakan anggota kita juga ingin meningkatkan arus pariwisata kota padang dan sumbar umumnya
3609120 melalui ajang ini mudah mudahan dapat meningkatkan arus wisatawan datang ke kota padang

3609123 we adopted puss when our son was just a year old and she quickly decided that the boy child must be her long lost kitten she would come and find us if he started crying and then quickly trot back to check on him if we didnt immediately follow her to assess the problem shed repeat the process
3609124 her favorite place to sleep is cuddled up with the boy child at night he almost cant go to sleep if shes not there on his pillow
3609125 i first wanted to dismiss this possibility but on studying the situation i feel that there is great danger of course if this government loses power it will not be in a position to dole out all kinds of goodies because at that time the clout is gone

3609135 the press thinks were at war over salary with tori i didnt know i was at war with tori
3609136 im really bummed because i love tori and i was psyched tori was going to be on the show i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid her father created the show it just seems wrong if thats the case i dont know what really happened because i havent talked to her i would like to talk to her
3609137 so i dont know if its about the money either
3609138 ill try to butt my head in whenever i can and tell people what i think about it

3609142 as long as he continues to do his work and be committed to his work then his personal business is his own frankly i dont have any judgment about it its got to be really hard when your life blows up that way i feel for him but as much as possible all of us have tried to divorce ourselves from that part of his life
3609143 theres a period where hes lighter in the show but that follows a period of him being very present in the show
3609144 its more of a situation where you need some characters to drop back so you can bring other characters forward youll see that holly is very present for a number of episodes and then for a couple she is much lighter thats the ebb and flow of having a big ensemble drama
3609145 the most dangerous job in hollywood is to be the recurring female lead on supernatural
3609146 no the formula in terms of romance that really has proven to work best for us is a girl in every port not that theres not ongoing characters but there are going to be recurring female characters threaded in and out of the story and they will affect the storylines but just to have them in sort of passive love interest roles is something that hasnt really worked
3609147 im not sure if im going to be in every episode this year but im going to be a regular
3609148 i had always been interested in doing another sitcom i love the energy from the audience its just a perfect situation

3609175 in naturally occurring material the index of refraction a measure of how light bends in a medium is positive when you see a fish in the water the fish will appear to be in front of the position it really is or if you put a stick in the water the stick seems to bend away from you
3609176 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface its kind of weird
3609177 however cloaking may be something that this material could be used for in the future youd have to wrap whatever you wanted to cloak in the material it would just send light around by sending light around the object that is to be cloaked you dont see it
3609178 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials
3609179 unfortunately for labour the elements beyond its control are likely to be decisive in 2008

3609181 labour is not a passive victim of whatever other parties do a

3609183 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
3609184 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3609185 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and avoid paying their fair share in the united states

3609221 personally i hate the jerky 24 fps film look id take 60 or 72 fps any day

3609252 american cartoons will place characters in a situation anime places situations around characters many anime shows have a continuing story while very nearly all american cartoons are episodic created specifically to be a series of individual stand alone stories rather than small pieces of a whole even in the case of anime series that are episodic the characters develop and change from episode to episode anime therefore engenders more personal involvement between the show and the viewer than typical american cartoons do
3609253 marassi is one of the premier mixed use communities in egypt and every component of this world class project has been carefully planned to create a distinctive lifestyle experience sidi abdel rahman is the most historic beach in egypt and is a much preferred mediterranean tourist destination our mou with the ritz carlton calls for developing a luxury resort to further consolidate marassis appeal to tourists and residents and contribute to the regions prosperity
3609254 the ritz carlton is very excited at the prospect of developing marassi in partnership with emaar misr we have set benchmarks for outstanding service and surroundings throughout the world including the middle east with the exceptional beachfront location the many luxury amenities available and the ease of access from key european nations this is a project with great potential for the growing collection of signature ritz carlton resorts
3609255 emaar hospitality group works with global partners to ensure the highest standards in hospitality and leisure in emaars master planned communities the marassi resort managed by the ritz carlton will be a sterling addition to the roster of emaar hospitality group

3609257 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
3609258 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head during something that is supposed to be a time of world unity
3609259 we remain very much dedicated to the region where we have been so successful for so many years yet one also has to be mindful of a changing landscape
3609260 particularly that concerning second homes and investment properties has become increasingly international in its clientele and increasingly broad in its geographical scope
3609261 we are very actively involved with international organisations such as christies and eren the european real estate network and through them we have had first hand experience of this phenomenon it is now commonplace to receive a request for properties in the mediterranean on behalf of a client in the us whilst european buyers are expanding their focus to include parts of asia and the americas
3609262 having an argentinean background myself this is a region and a property market that i know very well
3609263 it is very gratifying to see that the region from northern brazil to patagonia is opening up to foreign investment and it feels very natural to fulfil an intermediary role between two markets we know so well europe and south america
3609264 in south america the federal system means that these issues vary from region to region but there are large parts of brazil uruguay and argentina where planning directives are stricter and more stringently upheld than in many mediterranean countries it is in these areas of high desirability and quality of life that we specialise clients we take to places such as punta del este in uruguay are amazed both by its beauty and its sophistication moreover in areas where development is carefully managed and a balance is maintained between construction and environmental sensibilities the short and long term investment potential is excellent
3609265 chacras are semi rural subdivisions of a minimum of 5 hectares with holiday homes or fulltime residences
3609266 brazil is also increasingly popular although we focus on carefully selected high end areas it is still possible to buy beachfront plots for private villas in unspoiled and peaceful areas and i have just returned from sourcing land for clients in the itacare region on which they want to develop a small resort with a boutique hotel and condominium the area is full of possibilities and given brazils scale and expected future great power status it is not likely to be a flash in the pan
3609267 the key to our approach is as it has always been we carefully select the projects and areas offered and work only with reliable local agents and developers this is where the affiliation with organisation such as christies is so important the main criteria for selecting individual properties or projects are location aesthetic and practical appeal lifestyle and quality of life and surroundings that i consider good investments in safe places only once all these conditions are met and a legal due diligence is passed do we offer the product in question
3609268 it is an exciting time in which i feel i am bringing together what i have learned all these years in luxury real estate with a knowledge of the local market the net result is that we are able to find the top locations and use our established methods and ethics to weed out all but the most reputable professional partners that way we avoid wasting our clients and our own time and maintain a name that has taken over two decades to build up moreover it is great to see regions close to my heart developing and even more so to see them developing in a positive sustainable way i have been in this industry long enough to know that you have to offer quality to be successful in the luxury segment of the market and those areas that apply this rule can look forward to durable appeal
3609269 in the us bowlers are left to fend on their own unless they are sponsored by leading companies as esther is not sponsored she will be her own coach and ball rep when she competes
3609270 however the exposure will prepare her well for next years womens world championships in the united states
3609271 although she will be on her own i will be in constant contact with esther via electronic mail if she wants any advice
3609272 we have come a long way and the players are highly motivated
3609273 i dont think there is a single player who wants to give away the cup everyone wants to win it but terengganu are not an easy team to beat they are strong and the fact that they are in the semifinals says very much about their determination

3609276 there have been national enquirer headlines claiming a love child scandal involved senator john edwards or a member of his staff forcing edwards to issue a strong public denial

3609278 edwards contacted abc news and requested that he be interviewed about the allegations

3609316 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3609317 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3609318 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3609319 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3609320 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3609321 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3609322 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3609323 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3609324 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3609325 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3609326 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3609327 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3609328 honey there may be better cocksuckers than you but there are no better fucks
3609329 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3609330 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3609331 gina cobb is proof that not all lawyers deserve the death penalty

3609346 i wasnt on my a game physically it wasnt where it needed to be to be able to counter some of his attacks he was better then me today just better than me today
3609347 i sensed early on in the match that the refs were on my butt
3609348 i was trying to do everything right and i wound up giving up that point in the last period for that technical foul they said i was closed too long it changed the dynamics of the match instead of it being 1 1 now its 2 0 and i need a 3 point move to win
3609349 you gotta be that good you gotta be that good to where youre wrestling against a wrestler and three officials that was something i knew coming into the match i just wasnt able to over come it
3609350 soon as i get back home start hitting the grind
3609351 one day i too will wake up to the sun instead of an alarm clock i too will put on comfy tennis shoes and will push a printed stroller down windy suburban paths that will be the life then i will be able to rest my tired mind my always churning mind

3609363 countries that neighbor russia will think deeply about how to protect themselves how to guarantee security
3609364 the ability and the readiness to use force that russia has demonstrated shows that russia is a very serious power now
3609365 the aggressor has been punished and sustained very serious losses
3609366 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions
3609367 our position is that mr saakashvili can no longer be our partner
3609368 i want to tell the world let them bomb us let them destroy our infrastructure let them deploy 2 000 more tanks
3609369 but georgia will never surrender and will never kneel before russia
3609370 the war will definitely have a negative impact on relations between georgia and europe and the tone of the statements made by european leaders makes me think they blame georgia for what happened
3609371 and i think nato will say that while its sympathies go with georgia as things stand now georgias admission to nato would be premature
3609372 russias relationships with the u s and europe have been dealt quite a blow and the u s will try to if not isolate russia diminish the relationship as much as possible
3609373 if these kinds of operations continue against us in swat and in the tribal areas we will continue this
3609374 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal

3609376 they were retreating it wasnt panic but they were trying to leave one by one not in groups
3609377 we dont have anything we dont have food we left when the shelling started with very few things
3609378 we dont know whats going on and why the russians did this to us they said they were defending ossetians who are they defending here
3609379 if the russians say theyre defending the civilian population why dont they care about kodori gorge
3609380 they dont know where theyll go we have no idea theres so much confusion
3609381 it is time to start looking after myself and my family
3609382 my departure and seclusion in najaf is my response to all the mistakes we have made in the mahdi army
3609383 we fought for 50 days and in the end iraqi soldiers came and violated the sanctity of our homes
3609384 i will not join those cells even if i am personally asked to do so
3609385 but najaf can wait to fight the occupier with the imam mahdi army is holy work too

3609431 i guess more than anything its a little bit annoying that weve been made the scapegoat when you consider how much money we receive relative to the budget for the entire program
3609432 i think our funding comes in at something less than 0 1 per cent of the whole program
3609433 so all of these other larger groups who need money more than we do to travel abroad like ballet and symphonies we become the scapegoat for the cutting in their funding

3609438 clapp said hawaiis athletic travel budget at 2 75 million last year is expected to increase to 3 2 million this year that accounts for 10 75 percent of hawaiis athletic budget
3609439 clapp said the school is trying to offset some of the costs with increased ticket sales and increases in the value of radio and television rights hawaii also faces substantial travel costs in recruiting because many of its athletes come on visits from the mainland
3609440 it will cost more to bring student athletes to visit but were making a commitment to recruit the best student athletes we possibly can were not going to back away from that because of the cost of travel

3609475 it is easy to argue persuasively the truism that the lessons of history are best derived from what actually happened rather than from what nearly happened it should be added however that what happened becomes more fully comprehensible in the light of the contending forces that existed at moments of decision understanding of the total historical setting is bound to contribute to a clearer view of the actual course of affairs

3609495 initially people were shocked and concerned about their personal jobs and they then started to think about the future of social work with adults
3609496 if we can be marginalised to this extent we have to wonder whether other councils will follow suit
3609497 our view is that the majority of the work we do is complex it couldnt be done by someone without a social work qualification to the same standard
3609498 a number of the new jobs in the branch will not require the postholder to have a social work qualification this will mean that qualified social workers are deployed more effectively and can carry out more appropriate duties

3609524 we knew that we were going to face the best players in the world
3609525 it was a lot of fun even though it was very hard because they pressed us a lot you just have to take a lot of good things from this game because they are the best
3609526 what i will remember is the play in the second quarter the usa was on a fast break and somebody passed the ball to lebron and he dunked it with his left hand i think it was amazing
3609527 we are aware of the situation and are in the process of gathering information regarding this incident
3609528 we will refrain from further comment at this time until we have all the details and have had time to brief our personnel who are traveling due to the olympics

3609532 but now we can win this game and we did not
3609533 we had every chance to win and in the last two or three minutes of regulation time i thought we were winning
3609534 but we were too nervous by the end of the game to harvest victory

3609560 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3609561 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3609562 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3609563 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3609564 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3609565 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3609566 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3609567 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3609568 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3609569 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3609570 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3609571 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3609572 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3609573 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3609612 she spoke about everything in her life like it was morning traffic she was stuck in it and oblivious to the fact that she was part of the problem
3609613 her smile was like a fluorescent light uncomfortably bright and unnatural
3609614 shes like a stapler biting down as hard as she can just to keep it all together
3609615 shes like the thumbtacks on my cubicle wall colorful sharp but ultimately tacky
3609616 she was like that tree that i looked at with hope outside the office window so close but the few feet screamed of our distance

3609635 caregivers have a long exposure to stresses and losses from the dementia and fatigue that comes from caring for their spouses so they experience fewer positive emotions
3609636 some may have feelings of guilt about participating in activities with friends or in the community when their loved ones are no longer able to do so
3609637 specific effects of caring for a spouse with dementia differences in depressive symptoms between caregiver and non caregiver spouses
3609638 we know that parents have tremendous influence over how many fruits and vegetables their children eat
3609639 when parents eat more fruits and vegetables so do their children when parents eat and give their children high fat snacks or soft drinks children learn these eating patterns instead
3609640 this research shows that its important to communicate with parents in real world settings
3609641 they control the food environment for their young child this environment is key to not only what children eat today but how they will eat in the future
3609642 overweight children have already been exposed to salty sweet foods and learned to like them
3609643 to keep a child from becoming overweight parents need to expose them early to a variety of healthy foods and offer the foods many times
3609644 we want families to provide their child with an environment in which they not only learn how to eat healthy but have the opportunity to practice what they learn
3609645 and by partnering with parents as teachers we now can disseminate this program to their sites nationwide this further impacts healthy eating patterns in parents and their preschool children
3609646 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear

3609674 jhande wali mata is an avatar of maa durga the lord of all asuras did penance and tapasya for a long time seeing his unwavering faith the devas came down to earth to talk to him this king asked for a mega wish
3609675 the king said my death should be caused neither by a weapon nor by bare hands neither be on ground or in the air neither caused by man or a woman after this wish was granted he was being very evil to the kingdom to counter this maa durga appeared on earth as jhandewali mata she went to the palace with her red flag the king was lying on the bed snoring she stuck the flag through his heart the flag was technically not a weapon and he was lying on the bed which is neither ground or sky so the king died

3609732 firstly southern has extensive reserves and is an important aggregate supplier to baton rouge and lafayette two of the largest cities in louisiana second marc dyess with his extensive aggregate experience and louisiana market knowledge will add significant depth to the vantacore team his strategy of finding developing and marketing sand and gravel reserves has resulted in strong growth in sales and profits at southern third this acquisition expands vantacores geographic footprint while southerns strong marketing capabilities will complement our existing deep operational expertise

3609741 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3609742 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3609743 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3609744 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3609745 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

3609753 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3609754 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3609755 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3609756 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3609757 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3609759 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3609760 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3609761 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3609762 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3609763 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3609764 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3609765 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3609766 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3609767 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3609768 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3609769 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3609770 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3609771 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3609772 an individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of individualistic concern to the broader concerns of all humanity
3609773 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent
3609774 i have at all times tried to fair and honest with the students the faculty the staff and the community
3609775 at all times i have done what i have felt was in the best interests of the high school

3609777 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

3609779 the artist is nothing without gift but gift is nothing without work
3609780 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3609781 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3609782 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3609783 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3609784 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3609785 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3609786 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3609787 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3609788 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3609789 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3609790 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3609791 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3609792 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3609793 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

3609798 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3609799 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3609800 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3609801 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3609802 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3609803 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3609804 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3609805 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3609806 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3609807 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3609808 three men appear through the body of tokyo university graduate student kazutoshi obana during a 2003 demonstration of optical camouflage technology
3609809 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3609810 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3609811 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3609812 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3609813 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3609814 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3609815 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

3609834 vitamin d and health in the 21st century an update
3609835 given recent findings its easy to see why people are so enthusiastic about the potential power of vitamin d but we must recognize the limitations of any study and exercise caution when making broad public health recommendations
3609836 this is a very complex set of issues and there is still a lot we dont know about how vitamin d levels affect health especially across different age groups and ethnic populations
3609837 its tempting to think that an essential nutrient is safe at any level that if some is good more is better

3609855 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3609856 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3609857 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3609858 everyone knows the next one could be ukraine and then poland all of europe should be here now

3609860 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3609861 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3609862 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3609863 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3609864 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days

3609871 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama

3609885 i did not set out to offend anybody but sometimes when you are making an r rated comedy that happens
3609886 that is not what i set out to do but i think the movie is good and it speaks for itself
3609887 the jokes are all in context of what some actors are willing to do to win an oscar
3609888 that is a longstanding joke in hollywood that certain types of roles like the one joked about in the film help put you in the minds and eyes of the academy voters and to what lengths some actors will go to bring one of those gold bad boys home
3609889 t heres a part of me thats a little puzzled and disappointed like where were you when came out because that was pretty offensive

3609893 it may be appropriate for local authorities to check that council tax discounts are not wrongly claimed
3609894 but it is wholly disproportionate to threaten higher council tax bills if residents do not allow state officials into their bedrooms
3609895 this is another worrying sign of function creep state duties originally intended to tackle fraud are now being over used by bureaucrats in a heavy handed intrusive manner
3609896 pretending to live alone to defraud the taxpayer is not a victimless offence

3609899 if its frozen at sea and handled right properly we can live with it theres not a difference
3609900 we have to get consumers behind us to make a difference in what we eat

3609913 yeah theres a lot of time and financial resources invested in improving water quality condition and particularly in terms of investing in that river frontage or riparian strip
3609914 and we need to be confident that the recommended practises that are being proposed are both socially acceptable and soundly based
3609915 theres not much point scientists proposing recommended practises if farmers dont find them acceptable and its also important to see what land holders understand about the links between these practices and the water quality outcomes
3609916 they might have different understandings of things than the scientists

3609918 we are offering very aggressive real margins across our portfolio of solutions because we want to attract resellers that want to grow their security business
3609919 we are also doing this because we want to protect the integrity of our street prices
3609920 a huge chunk of this market is being controlled by direct marketing resellers that buy huge volumes of products sell them very cheaply and provide very little if any after sales support

3609998 what id say to the commercial banks is this if youre registering in these economic circumstances a 7 per cent increase in profit and im all for our companies being profitable its a part and parcel of the market economy
3609999 but if youre a bank generating significant profits and commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years i would say that those banks owe it to working families where working australians are under financial pressure at the moment that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
