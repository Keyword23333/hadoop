7020050 peer reviewed journals play an irreplaceable role in authenticating articles through registration certification dissemination and editorial improvement
7020051 for our member publishers making access to research articles free at any point after or even upon publication presupposes a means of recovering revenues that allow the journal to exist
7020052 the embargo periods foreseen in the context of the commissions open access pilot six to 12 months after initial publication provide a safeguard for the investment made by scientific publishers
7020053 this approach assumes that an article has little value after its embargo period for the vast majority of journals this is a dangerous and fallacious assumption

7020094 hello ryp i found this one a week ago in the record store i thought i share it
7020095 janet and i wanted to create a collection that empowers women and that makes women feel sexy flirtatious and provocative
7020096 people have come to me with other ideas but lingerie is a passion for me and just like music and acting i cant do it unless i put 100 into it theres something for every woman and thats very important to us ive always hated when lingerie is uncomfortable so the fit and comfort was key
7020097 meditation is old and honorable so why should i not sit every morning of my life on the hillside looking into the shining world because properly attended to delight as well as havoc is suggestion can one be too passionate about the just the ideal the sublime and the holy and yet commit no labor in its cause i dont think so all summations have a beginning all effect has a story all kindness begins with the sown seed thought buds toward radiance the gospel of light is the crossroads of indolence or action be ignited or be gone

7020102 we knew coming in that we may never have this experience again so we are lucky that everything went well and we got what we wanted
7020103 i think he has played very well in the olympic tournament
7020104 hes played very well today as he normally does in his position and i knew that he could probably be the deciding factor
7020105 i think if the game had been played in another part of the day it would have been very different
7020106 we tried to make sure that we didnt get uptight just too play our own game
7020107 we wanted to play with intelligence and move the ball around and not run around so much we wanted the ball to do the work
7020108 no team has actually played at noon since we started this tournament
7020109 it affected both countries and most players didnt perform to their level because of the heat but we didnt make the rules they said play the game at 12 oclock which i dont think wasnt a good idea
7020110 i was one of the detectives who were attached to the special investigation board instituted by the pndc government to investigate the killings of the three high court judges and the retired army major
7020111 gerade wegen und nach dem wortbruch von andrea ypsilanti eine neue legitimation der b rgerinnen und b rger holen
7020112 a lot of guys came to me and said theyve been inspired
7020113 i said to them you have to be relaxed we know were capable of doing it youve got to enjoy what you do yes i guess ive had a little bit of an impact people have gone out there and enjoyed themselves its great for the sport
7020114 i wouldnt say im a phenomenon im just a great athlete
7020115 i try and stay relaxed by messing around and not thinking too much about the race
7020116 i dont allow people to put pressure on me you might not be focused enough when i enjoy myself i stay focused ill still enjoy myself im still young ill still train hard ill try to keep on top for as long as i can
7020117 running is enjoyable you have to enjoy what you do its a job for us athletes its like working to not enjoy it it doesnt make sense i enjoy it i love it sometimes you think about quitting at training because thats hard but it also makes success more great when you work hard for it
7020118 the track is fast i said to asafa powell and my coach glen mills that anybody who wins is going to break the world record
7020119 i dont know how fast i can go im not really worried about that
7020120 im just looking forward to going on and doing better things i hope to improve every year
7020121 ill definitely be going to the london olympics to defend my title
7020122 people said the 200m world record would be pretty hard to get i got it and its going to be hard to improve it
7020123 i never had a chance to understand her but now the awkwardness is gone
7020124 it all depends on the kind of behaviour that the person in front of you shows
7020125 the opening of the limnitis checkpoint is not connected to any other matter
7020126 we condemn all kinds of provocative actions that take place in that sensitive village of pyla wherever these may come from
7020127 our position regarding the issue of opening the limnitis checkpoint is well known and is not connected to anything else
7020128 we are working for the opening of the particular checkpoint as soon as possible because it will serve both the greek cypriots and the turkish cypriots in the area
7020129 the repetition of the well known stance of the greek cypriots and the extension of the claims of the greek cypriot side for suzerainty on the island
7020130 the incident in pyla demonstrates the need for the presence of turkish troops on the island
7020131 but she had to be whisked away immediately from lonavla on monday early tuesday morning she had her flight from where she had to be taken for chemotherapy in london
7020132 yes i was hurt when in the big brother house she made some comments about our country but even in the house we had made peace after the initial rancour once i was out of the house the media went to town and she got the brunt of it
7020133 believe me it was really sad when jade was slammed i never wanted become a champion of the third world at her cost
7020134 yeah when the channel decided on jade they asked me if it was okay with me if i had any ill feelings towards her id have said no to jade but the truth is there was no ill feelings towards jade my only precondition was that jade should be treated well at big boss i knew how it felt when to go into a foreign country and be in a hostile situation big brother to my delight the big boss contestants were very nice to jade i felt so proud to see how she was treated it just reiterated the fact we indians are very forgiving and welcoming

7020142 we worked well and acquired a lot of data from this track which over the next few hours will be used to prepare ourselves as well as possible for this weekend from what we could see given the usual unknowns on a friday we can say we are competitive whether we will be competitive enough to reach our target will only be revealed starting with tomorrow afternoons qualifying
7020143 they were two enjoyable sessions with the lap times tumbling bit by bit as the drivers lapped and got confidence in the track layout the track surface is still very dirty and it is easy to make mistakes which can lose you precious tenths and to do a good lap time you have to be perfect i like the track theres a nice atmosphere and i have to say the organizers have done a good job today it was important that we find a good base set up immediately and we managed to do that
7020144 i like driving this track it is different to other street circuits we have known yesterday when i walked the track i thought it would be fun and today confirmed that impression there are some very quick parts and almost everywhere theres a lot of room maybe similar to some of the north american circuits used in the past they have really done a good job today our weekend got off to a good start but obviously it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition overtaking it will be difficult as always i hope i dont need to by getting the best position in qualifying the set up we have found today is not bad but there is still plenty of room for improvement

7020153 does not mandate that the sheriff physically confine all offenders within the four walls of the house of correction for the entire length of the committed portions of their sentences
7020154 to the contrary the statutory scheme confers on the sheriff the authority to permit certain eligible inmates to participate in a variety of programs outside the correctional facility we conclude that the actions of he sheriff were within his statutory powers
7020155 its always a good feeling to know you are doing something right he said but added he challenged kottmyers ruling not to create animosity
7020156 this program is a judicious and wise use of proven rehab techniques dipaola said
7020157 we use the gps system to change someones behavior not to empty the jails dipaola said
7020158 the gps program by releasing a committed offender into his own home thus exceeds the sheriffs authority under governing law
7020159 no one is walking in the front door and walking out the back door with a bracelet
7020160 you could argue that the golden years of hollywood were when it was in the hands of vulgarians in the 30s and 40s
7020161 and that shakespeare was in a sense a vulgarian a lowly actor who wrote all that great stuff for those rambunctious theatres at a very rude time
7020162 somebody came up and told me that when turkey shoot was released they thought it was the death knell of australian cinema because it was just so violent and exploitative
7020163 an unjustly forgotten cinematic era that was unashamedly packed full of boobs pubes and tubes
7020164 thats when i realised there were great stories to be told about this period
7020165 there is a maverick renegade element to making these films we hadnt had an industry in australia for a very long time so it was a case of building the industry from the ground up there were no rules we were putting pretty remarkable things on the screen without really knowing the proper way to do it a fair amount of energy comes from that freedom
7020166 i thought he might enjoy reading the research that id done
7020167 so i sent him my research document and he read it from cover to cover
7020168 they saw a quality in them that was different to american films
7020169 they saw that there was a way we shot our bush there was a way we shot our cars that was very distinctly australian
7020170 the 70s was a huge time of change in australia
7020171 we had an incredible amount of censorship and that was suddenly lifted what people now see as exploitation people at the time found enlightening it was refreshing it was liberating to see this content on screen
7020172 when we spoke to the actresses from these times they said at first there was no sense that they were getting exploited some of them said it was like they were making a statement about feminism and womanhood
7020173 for every incredibly bad film like turkey shoot there is an incredibly well crafted film like road games
7020174 some of these films found incredibly enthusiastic audiences and made a lot of money overseas but we never heard of them in australia they werent respected australian films here
7020175 on turkey shoot i was hanging onto a runaway train
7020176 when 44 days got cut to 28 something had to give so the result is not perfect
7020177 im certainly aware of the rough edges in all of them but i dont think they were ever held up to be engines of social change or pinnacles of great art
7020178 mad dog morgan is one of my favourite movies the howling horror movies were just fun a sketch sci fi comedy the return of captain invincible was a total experiment thats one of the things that the much maligned 10ba tax concessions enabled filmmakers to do experiment experiment means youre able to fail
7020179 i dont know if the movies that were made back then in australia were the highest art form but they certainly were great fun

7020182 in the beginning of any media format a lot of content is oriented toward men
7020183 as more content is created for the female market women become dominant and drive most of the ad dollars
7020184 we think of segments of individuals who share certain attitudes and needs
7020185 women will often follow because they want to keep a family plan
7020186 dit is zonder twijfel de meest indrukwekkende cast die we ooit hebben gehad in de dertien jaar dat we filmfragmenten maken voor command amp onquer
7020187 het niveau van de acteerprestaties zowel van de individuele acteurs als van de groep maakt de verhaallijn zoveel intenser het productieniveau van deze filmbeelden doet niet onder voor dat van films en televisieseries en daar zijn we bijzonder tevreden mee

7020200 there are those who argue that everything breaks even in this old

7020204 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7020205 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7020206 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7020207 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7020208 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7020209 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

7020216 i was asked before beijing what my wish for these games was and i answered that it would be ireland going through the three weeks without being tainted by any hint of doping
7020217 i am sick and tired of our name being dragged through the mud like this
7020218 we need to work every hour of every day now to restore confidence in the sport
7020219 other sports have done it and now we need to i could understand how peoples confidence would be shaken
7020220 within three quarters of an hour of landing in hong kong word came through that there had been a positive test for an irish horse
7020221 the only thing that got to kenny was kenny himself

7020223 ive beaten half of the lads in the group the rest of them i havent met but i know them im good to go
7020224 i have to bring my a game to the table
7020225 sometimes i leave it behind at the most crucial moment i dont know what im thinking
7020226 at the highest level of sport you want that extra one or two per cent all the top sportsmen in the world come under mental strain and the guys who deal with it the best are the guys who come through
7020227 i gave it 100 per cent in there its been a long haul to get where i am it has been a dream of mine to do this i just cant believe it right now
7020228 youve got to try and make them boxers believe that theyre capable of giving their best performance
7020229 the best psychologist is the coach you have to adjust to each individual
7020230 i went down to my local club in neilstown and started off from there now im in this position
7020231 this is what its all about this is a dream im in dreamland
7020232 and you have to be in it to win it
7020233 i feel like all the stuff i didnt like about trek has started to overwhelm the things i love about it
7020234 without knowing that i needed a reminder not to take this stuff so seriously without knowing in april when the wheels were set into motion that around the beginning of august id be feeling pretty lousy john did what good friends do pick you up when youre down and provide reality checks when you need them the most
7020235 star trek is something that i shouldnt take as seriously as ive taken it lately
7020236 id given idiots way too much control over how i felt about it and how i felt about that part of my life where star trek and me intersect id lost perspective and it took a velvet wesley crusher to bring it back
7020237 the 300 readers of his blog know what that means
7020238 take all these uncommitted changes in my working copy and make a new patch out of them
7020239 when you put a thing on your to do list you are making a committment to do it
7020240 so you have to choose between those things now why do you have to choose
7020241 just keep telling yourself im going to die im going to die im going to die
7020242 mi vida privada la resuelvo yo y no me la tiene que resolver ningun gremio
7020243 watch the hell out im just about to win the game
7020244 i can remember playing monopoly and clue with my neighborhood friends chess incessantly i played tournament chess i played 2 board at utah state university ive always been a game player period
7020245 the spark was ignited when i was assigned to do the unit on electricity and got to play with the science box i remember constantly making stuff as a kid that amazed my friends using electricity
7020246 i think that working at the amusement park gave me a sense that i had a special knack for that i was able to have a lot of people have fun and spend their money while doing it those were two good characteristics
7020247 when you divide 25 cents into an 8 million computer there aint no way
7020248 i always considered myself an engineer a guy who used technology to solve problems i was fascinated with disney who used technology to entertain people i felt technology was truly magical
7020249 when i graduated from college my vision of the perfect job was to work in the research section of disneyland
7020250 100 of the video games up until 1977 used my discreet logic technology that i had a patent on
7020251 nobody wants to read an encyclopedia to play a game
7020252 i thought it was a cool name when i found it in the dictionary
7020253 i thought atari was a good warning to the competition in the gaming industry
7020254 when we did computer space there were about 7 prototype units that were really not to standard that could be sold to 3rd parties we saw them as an opportunity and we put them on location and collected the quarters every week when we did that some of the places wanted pinball so we started buying equipment and collecting the quarters that was one of the early ways we financed the business
7020255 nolan told me that we had a contract from general electric to design a home video game on a ping pong theme
7020256 i had to come up with a game people already knew how to play something so simple that any drunk in a bar could play
7020257 but when he alcorn got it up and running it turned out to be a hell of a lot of fun
7020258 i had the prototype running in three months and i was very disappointed because it had about 75 ttl ics and would cost way too much for a high volume home machine it turns out that nolan had something else in mind he lied about the contract with ge and gave me this project because it was the simplest game he could think of and he just wanted me to practice on something
7020259 since i was under the impression that this was to be a real product i worked hard to make it playable and inexpensive
7020260 two weeks after installing the game al alcorn got a late night phone call from the manager of the bar
7020261 when we first put it on location i asked nolan what would constitute good performance i think he said that if it did 25 a week that would be a good game it was doing over 100 per week right away
7020262 at that point in time i knew i had a successful business
7020263 nolan had to convince us to be in the manufacturing business in the end it turned out to be the best strategy
7020264 as a result of pong a player can gain a deep intuitive understanding of the simplest newtonian physics
7020265 with expensive parts such as cabinets we tried to get them out the same day they came in and we made sure that 75 of the cost turned over in less than a week
7020266 i filed for a patent but in those days patents took 3 years to issue i dont think my patent issued until 1975 or 1976
7020267 atari was always scrambling for cash and we thought to spend money on attorneys was not a smart thing to do
7020268 they did an excellent job of creating a game using analog circuitry but it just wasnt fun
7020269 it was a strategic thing magnavox was desperate to settle with me they had seen lab books and i had been in business for two years before the odyssey game was supposed to hit the streets we settled basically for an amount of money that was less than i was spending on attorneys fees at the time 500 000 paid over five years less than 1 10th of 1 it was a usage royalty
7020270 as far as we were concerned that was the end of our problems with atari
7020271 in our agreement we required that they go after all our competitors literally i felt that if we could keep everyone else distracted and paying money that could only help our business i was not worried about magnavox being a competitor it was a strategic business move any time you can damage your competitors walk away from it with token royalty and have everyone else sweating bullets because they knew that had copied my stuff it was a good thing for atari
7020272 we were hiring people as fast as we could and paying them hippie wages which was still above minimum wage it was a situation where we were doing an awful lot of training
7020273 all employees received the same medical benefits as the executives
7020274 we define our product as innovative leisure we will build the best products possible and serve our markets in such a way that through time the atari name is synonymous with quality imagination research after sale service and social responsibility
7020275 we only had so much money and somewhere along the line he said lets split ill take the operations business because at that time operations was making more money than manufacturing
7020276 id like to hire you to set up a company called kee games well make it look like its kee for keenan and it will look like youve come in and started up a new coin op manufacturer
7020277 an amazing maze of fun another innovative winner from atari the leader in video skill games
7020278 the name stuck for many years bushnell told the magazine referring to
7020279 we have to walk a tightrope between reward and frustration
7020280 the small companies will be in trouble when the crunch arrives
7020281 an improvement on a proven money maker from the originators of pong
7020282 another video action favorite quadrapong is the newest addition to ataris line of unique video skill games
7020283 we had built about 100 and they were badly engineered that they had to take them back i came off of sabbatical and re designed it
7020284 from the pong people new video game concept big racing action fantastic sound effects worldwide market in millions
7020285 in pin pong a gravity algorithm accelerates the ball downward to give realistic pinball action on the screen
7020286 i was working on it when i hired lyle then i gave it to him and he finished it a lot of the implementation was his but the original idea was mine
7020287 i really became the ceo i was still doing what i call game producing but i was not doing any of the design we would sit down in creative sessions and i would pretty much decide which games we would be doing but i became less and less involved in the actual engineering
7020288 we define our product as innovative leisure we will build the best products possible and serve our markets in such a way that through time the atari name is synonymous with quality imagination research after sale service and social responsibility
7020289 a corporation is simply people banding together in an organized fashion to produce products or accomplishments which would not be possible otherwise when the goals of atari and the goals of its people are in harmony atari is strong and its people are happy and satisfied
7020290 maintain a social atmosphere where we can be friends and comrades apart from the organizational hierarchy encourage and promote personal growth through education and training such as that we may all reach our individual potentialities
7020291 ataris strategy was actually quite simple and i think quite elegant we were known as a party place but the important thing is that parties didnt happen unless quotas were made we had a lot of parties because people made their numbers
7020292 ataris jet fighter is a video action game in which players pilot two airplanes across the sky in a fast moving duel
7020293 ataris crash n score is a video action game in which one or two players drive race cars on a rectangular playfield and earn score points by driving through lighted score flags during play a player has to maneuver his car around certain obstacles and has to avoid the opponent car
7020294 atari had a real crude attitude about things jaws was such a big movie and we decided we would do a game that was sharks eating people we decided we would do it under the nom de plum of horror games shark jaws was actually a huge success we sold a couple thousand
7020295 i got to talking about pong with an engineer friend of mine named harold lee who was working in coin op i really wanted to do a consumer product so i asked him whether we could put pong on a chip it would be a dedicated home game for tv that would essentially be like the coin op pong he said it could be done and then we sold atari on the idea
7020296 we were all young it was the 70s it seemed like the right thing to do
7020297 the next epiphany if you would was when we figured out we could put pong on a single lsi chip all of a sudden we knew we could put one in every home all of a sudden we went from a very successful coin op business to a potential consumer business
7020298 we risked the company every year on new ideas we were young and if it failed we could always get jobs in silicon valley
7020299 now the people who brought motor sports racing to a video track brings your customers a fantastic motorcycle jump and stunt attraction
7020300 nolan bushnell wanted a game that was like a single player pong with bricks that you would hit and the ball would go behind them
7020301 the reason atari wanted me to design it is they were tired of their games taking 150 200 chips and they knew i designed things with very few chips so we had incentives for getting it under 50 or under 40 chips
7020302 the design was so minimized that normal mere mortals couldnt figure it out
7020303 new programming and electronic design give the players more action movement and larger more animated figures
7020304 a solo driver sprints against the clock in a white car but he is not alone
7020305 sprint 2 is earning extremely well we feel it will surpass many of the other video games
7020306 i have fond memories of spending time watching the white lines in the street and fence posts whiz by my car as i drove to and from work trying to work out in my minds eye what kind of math i can use to make little squares on a tv kind of do the same thing
7020307 we said no thank you but i liked him i thought he was a nice guy so i introduced him to venture capitalists
7020308 steve mayer and ron milner conceived of the vcs and designed the first prototype of its ancestor
7020309 in march of 1976 i moved to los gatos ca to apprentice for jay miner the lead chip designer
7020310 i would bicycle to work and back marveling that i was getting paid to do this
7020311 i always played business as a game what a lot of people dont realize is that i tied up every n channel manufacturer in the world except for ibm who had no interest in the game business in those days when you built with slight modifications to tie them up i wanted to have everybody working for me contractually they did not necessarily know about one another
7020312 when youre a little company and you hear that national semiconductor is going to build a game and that magnavox is going to build a game then all of a sudden you say im this little tiny do i have the resources
7020313 what happened is a growing business consumes capital at prodigious rates and wall street had a hard time distinguishing between the frivolity of our product and the fact that it was a serious business raising capital was very very difficult for us in order to go into the consumer marketplace we just needed much deeper pockets and thats why we decided to sell
7020314 we had originally made a grocery list of 10 companies we would be willing to merge atari with and warner was not on that list but through a connection we made contact with warner we were really impressed with them and i think they liked what they saw
7020315 it happened so often that we would have the hardware engineer add a button under the table that would cause the hardware to crash so when the vp came into the lab we could not show him them game
7020316 super bug was my first coin operated video game it presented a top down view of a city street its original name was city driver the player had a fixed amount of time to drive his bright yellow bug as far as he could obviously the idea was to drive as fast as possible this was made difficult by sudden turns in the road surprise oil slicks sand traps and parked cars
7020317 pool shark is an atari game that simulates the game of pocket pool no pun intended on 23
7020318 as the aircraft fly over the canyon at random speeds players press a simple push button control to bomb as many targets as possible without missing
7020319 i got in because i felt there was a market for a novelty pinball there was a lot of innovation that pinball needed and in those days in the coin op world you really wanted to be a full service supplier there were places that just wanted pinball period we knew that we had such a large market share of video so we felt that it would make sense to do pinball
7020320 so we had about 100 cost differential and the pinball machines in those days were kind of commodity priced i felt we could make a business but we could not do a commodity pinball one that looked like it was the same size so we created these wide bodies and these various other innovations which allowed us to price them anywhere we wanted to
7020321 the atarians introduces a new generation of advanced coin operated amusement products two years of research planning and development and an extensive field test program has verified strong player acceptance of the game
7020322 clear proof that pinball is the industrys number one favorite
7020323 the grand opening on may 16th was a great success mayor janet gray hayes together with many other prominent people from the community and the press came to welcome chuck e cheese and the pizza time theatre to san jose this new concept in family entertainment is another amusement innovation from atari
7020324 they sort of tolerated it but they figured it was going to be something that would go away they didnt understand it
7020325 bob brown had designed video music our weirdest product ever hook it up to your stereo and tv at the same time and the sound triggered some pretty psychedelic visuals the sears guys took one look and asked what wed been smoking when we did that naturally one of our techs lit up a joint and showed them
7020326 we feel that video music will add excitement to the audio market
7020327 i saw their ad in the mercury news and applied for the job i was among 100 applicants and bob brown later told me they hired me because i had purchased an altair 8800 the first home computer kit
7020328 writing the kernels that make up the game programs is like solving acrostic puzzles with lots and lots of possibilities theres a certain class of programmer that can deal in the microcode like that if it were easier to program we wouldnt have these programmers because theyd be bored the vcs is an absolute challenge
7020329 in the early days the extreme hardware constraints eliminated most obvious game designs so game concepts had to be developed with those constraints expressly in mind after i came up with a concept that i thought would be fun and could be implemented i wrote it up and discussed it with others in the group like david crane bob whitehead and larry kaplan
7020330 most early vcs rom carts were only 2kbytes programmers had to put tremendous effort into implementing a decent game in that small space
7020331 the first time i saw combat on display in the local fedmart tv section i was blown away there were actual arcade games up on that screen
7020332 air sea battle was based on an atari coin op called anti aircraft in those days we just ripped off anything we could make work
7020333 those paintings on the box detailed exactly how i felt about the games the graphics were so minimal at the time the boxes formed an important part of game play experience when i was playing air sea battle i was playing in that painting
7020334 a total of 14 game variations enliven this auto sports cartridge it is priced somewhat higher than all the other early atari releases because it includes a pair of specially designed game controllers
7020335 people didnt know whether to spend 30 to 50 on the numerous dedicated games that were still on the shelves or slap down 180 for the vcs a considerably larger expense
7020336 in the summer of 1977 i went back to grass valley to work with ron and steve on the next generation machine
7020337 the incredible incredible story of atari from a 500 lark to a 2 billion business in 10 short years
7020338 when threatened with a hairbrush by a vicious woman remain calm and speak in cold level tones
7020339 if mothers could learn to do for themselves what they do for their children we should have happier households let the mother go out to play if she would only have courage to let everything go when life becomes too tense and just take a day or half a day out in the fields or with a favorite book or in a picture gallery looking long and well at just two or three pictures or in bed without the children life would go on far more happily for both children and parents

7020399 one night i dreamed that i was in the garden of gethsemane a witness of the saviors agony
7020400 as he prayed the tears streamed down his face which was turned toward me i was so moved at the sight that i wept also out of pure sympathy with his great sorrow my whole heart went out to him i loved him with all my soul and longed to be with him as i longed for nothing else
7020401 presently he arose and walked to where those apostles were kneeling fast asleep he shook them gently awoke them and in a tone of tender reproach untinctured by the least show of anger or scolding asked them if they could not watch with him one hour
7020402 returning to his place he prayed again and then went back and found them again sleeping
7020403 i shall never forget the kind and gentle manner in which he stooped and raised me up and embraced me it was so vivid so real that i felt the very warmth of his bosom against which i rested then he said no my son these have finished their work and they may go with me but you must stay and finish yours still i clung to him gazing up into his face for he was taller than i i besought him most earnestly well promise me that i will come to you at the last he smiled sweetly and tenderly and replied that will depend entirely upon yourself i awoke with a sob in my throat and it was morning
7020404 youre terrible and damned and theres nothing you can do about it
7020405 i had some anxieties going on a mission and then i had a miserable mission
7020406 kismayo is relatively calm today saturday but residents in janayabdale village reported new clashes in the area
7020407 the remnants of the clan militias and some of their commanders tried to cross janayabdale where they encountered an attack from the islamists several people were injured in the clashes
7020408 there was some sporadic gunfire overnight from friday to saturday but no fighting
7020409 the major battle is over but the militiamen that were dislodged by islamists may try their luck to regain the town
7020410 its always like that so they can justify the heavy bombardment and the assaults
7020411 your cafgus citizens armed forces geographic unit should not anymore add to the pressure of air strikes and shelling
7020412 if thats the case we will accommodate them as they are also our fellow filipino brothers as long as they will not initiate trouble we welcome them to our area of responsibility
7020413 if their purpose is just to seek refuge with their relatives in jose abad santos to avoid involvement in the ongoing war in central mindanao we will give them a chance to do so for we understand their situation
7020414 but if commander kato is with them it is another story we have to get him since he is now wanted for committing various crimes
7020415 we are calling for a cessation of hostilities we can go back again to the negotiating table with malaysia as mediator but the moa ad issue is non negotiable its a done deal
7020416 we are in the situation wherein the peace process is in dilemma if the government will not change its position the peace process would completely collapse
7020417 the peace process is a continuing struggle if it will not succeed we will continue our struggle in any form
7020418 our position is firm the moa ad is a done deal we cannot allow renegotiating

7020524 i couldnt even drive by a dentists office without getting stressed out
7020525 i was paralyzed i couldnt even consider going to the dentists office
7020526 it was much easier to accept the pain sick as that sounds
7020527 youre lying prone a dentist is hovering above you and hes putting you in a situation where you can hardly talk or respond that creates a lot of anxiety for some people because they dont feel in control
7020528 if all dentists were a lot more careful about pain control took the time to be sure patients were comfortable and didnt go ahead if they werent comfortable then we would create fewer phobics
7020529 i want to talk about what can be done to make me more comfortable i dont want someone to tell me something doesnt hurt me

7020534 i think aaron rodgers has done everything right from a focus standpoint
7020535 he was put in a situation thats different hes done a very good job of focusing through that and at the end of the day you need to focus on playing quarterback and i thought he did that very well tonight
7020536 it has been a good preseason so far a lot of growing as a player and i think tonight was a good step for our offense after last week and to get the kind of time i got tonight we really needed to take a step forward and i think we did that
7020537 im happy for him hes in a tough spot over there he needed this outing
7020538 he looked sharp their offense looked good so i think theyre going to be pretty good
7020539 we audibled to just a go route because it was press and there was no safety over the top and there was a young guy in front of me
7020540 when he first came in there i was like jay when you see that 38 in there youve got to throw it up
7020541 first play was a little underthrown and i told him that if they give us the same look the next play then lets just go right back at it

7020547 we stand by our account and our reports and what we know and i cant reconcile why the interior ministry would have a different figure
7020548 all allegations of civilian casualties are taken very seriously coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives

7020552 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7020553 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7020554 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7020555 i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre aug 7 position as agreed

7020561 the committee reiterates its earlier recommendation that a consolidated list of prisoners with full particulars be reconciled and exchanged this should be done expeditiously and in any case before the next meeting of the committee

7020572 itu karena adanya perbedaan pendapat di antara elemen umat islam apakah awal masuk dan keluarnya bulan ramadhan itu ditentukan oleh ru yatul hilal melihat hilal ataukah dengan ilmu hisab
7020573 karena adanya perbedaan pendapat apakah di dunia ini hanya berlaku satu mathla tempat keluarnya hilal ataukah masing masing negeri mempunyai mathla sendiri sendiri
7020574 apa hubungannya antara ketaatan terhadap penguasa dengan pelaksanaan shaum ramadhan
7020575 barangsiapa menaatiku berarti telah menaati allah barangsiapa menentangku berarti telah menentang allah barangsiapa menaati pemimpin umat ku berarti telah menaatiku dan barangsiapa menentang pemimpin umat ku berarti telah menentangku
7020576 di dalam hadits ini terdapat keterangan tentang kewajiban menaati para penguasa dalam perkara perkara yang bukan kemaksiatan adapun hikmahnya adalah untuk menjaga persatuan dan kebersamaan umat islam karena di dalam perpecahan terdapat kerusakan
7020577 seseorang hendaknya bershaum bersama penguasa dan jamaah mayoritas umat islam baik ketika cuaca cerah ataupun mendung
7020578 sebagian ahlul ilmi menafsirkan hadits ini1 dengan ucapan mereka sesungguhnya shaum dan berbukanya itu dilaksanakan bersama dan mayoritas umat islam
7020579 yang jelas makna hadits ini adalah bahwasanya perkara perkara semacam ini menentukan pelaksanaan shaum ramadhan berbuka puasa iedul fithri dan iedul adha pen keputusannya bukanlah di tangan individu tidak ada hak bagi mereka untuk melakukannya sendiri sendiri bahkan permasalahan semacam ini dikembalikan kepada penguasa dan mayoritas umat islam dalam hal ini setiap individu pun wajib untuk mengikuti penguasa dan mayoritas umat islam maka dari itu jika ada seseorang yang melihat hilal bulan sabit namun penguasa menolak persaksiannya sudah sepatutnya untuk tidak dianggap persaksian tersebut dan wajib baginya untuk mengikuti mayoritas umat islam dalam permasalahan itu
7020580 dan selama belum terwujud bersatunya negeri negeri islam di atas satu mathla dalam menentukan pelaksanaan shaum ramadhan pen aku berpendapat bahwa setiap warga negara hendaknya melaksanakan shaum ramadhan bersama negaranya pemerintahnya masing masing dan tidak bercerai berai dalam perkara ini yakni shaum bersama pemerintah dan sebagian lainnya shaum bersama negara lain baik mendahului pemerintahnya atau pun belakangan karena yang demikian itu dapat mempertajam perselisihan di tengah masyarakat muslim sendiri sebagaimana yang terjadi di sebagian negara arab sejak beberapa tahun yang lalu wallahul mustaan
7020581 aku telah shalat di mina hari hari haji pen bersama nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam abu bakr umar dan di awal pemerintahan utsman 2 rakaat dan setelah itu utsman shalat 4 rakaat kemudian terjadilah perbedaan di antara kalian sebagian shalat 4 rakaat dan sebagian lagi 2 rakaat pen dan harapanku dari 4 rakaat shalat itu yang diterima adalah yang 2 rakaat darinya
7020582 engkau telah mengingkari utsman atas shalatnya yang 4 rakaat mengapa kemudian engkau shalat 4 rakaat pula
7020583 jika awal masuknya bulan ramadhan telah diumumkan di salah satu negeri islam semisal kerajaan saudi arabia namun di negeri kami belum diumumkan bagaimanakah hukumnya apakah kami bershaum bersama kerajaan saudi arabia ataukah bershaum dan berbuka bersama penduduk negeri kami manakala ada pengumuman demikian pula halnya dengan masuknya iedul fithri apa yang harus kami lakukan bila terjadi perbedaan antara negeri kami dengan negeri yang lainnya semoga allah subhanahu wa taala membalas engkau dengan kebaikan
7020584 waktu shaum itu di hari kalian umat islam bershaum waktu berbuka adalah pada saat kalian berbuka dan waktu berkurban iedul adha di hari kalian berkurban
7020585 umat islam di luar dunia islam sering berselisih dalam menyikapi berbagai macam permasalahan seperti penentuan masuk dan keluarnya bulan ramadhan serta saling berebut jabatan di bidang dakwah fenomena ini terjadi setiap tahun hanya saja tingkat ketajamannya berbeda beda tiap tahunnya penyebab utamanya adalah minimnya ilmu agama mengikuti hawa nafsu dan terkadang fanatisme madzhab atau partai tanpa mempedulikan rambu rambu syariat islam dan bimbingan para ulama yang kesohor akan ilmu dan wara nya maka adakah sebuah nasehat yang kiranya bermanfaat dan dapat mencegah terjadinya sekian kejelekan semoga allah subhanahu wa taala memberikan taufiq dan penjagaan nya kepada engkau
7020586 dan janganlah kalian seperti orang orang yang berpecah belah dan berselisih setelah keterangan datang kepada mereka dan bagi mereka adzab yang pedih
7020587 dan tidak mengapa bagi penduduk negeri manapun jika tidak melihat hilal bulan tsabit di tempat tinggalnya pada malam ke 30 untuk mengambil hasil ru yatul hilal dari tempat lain di negerinya jika umat islam di negeri tersebut berbeda pendapat dalam hal penentuannya maka yang harus diikuti adalah keputusan penguasa di negeri tersebut bila ia seorang muslim karena dengan mengikuti keputusannya akan sirnalah perbedaan pendapat itu dan jika si penguasa bukan seorang muslim maka hendaknya mengikuti keputusan majelis departemen pusat yang membidangi urusan umat islam di negeri tersebut hal ini semata mata untuk menjaga kebersamaan umat islam dalam menjalankan shaum ramadhan dan shalat id di negeri mereka wabillahit taufiq washallallahu ala nabiyyina muhammad wa alihi wa shahbihi wasallam
7020588 dan berpegang teguhlah kalian semua dengan tali agama allah dan janganlah kalian bercerai berai
7020589 allah subhanahu wa taala mewajibkan kepada kita agar berpegang teguh dengan kitab nya al qur an dan sunnah nabi nya serta merujuk kepada keduanya di saat terjadi perselisihan
7020590 wahai orang orang yang beriman taatilah allah dan rasul nya dan ulil amri di antara kalian
7020591 yang dimaksud dengan ulil amri adalah orang orang yang allah subhanahu wa taala wajibkan untuk ditaati dari kalangan para penguasa dan pemimpin umat
7020592 wahai rasulullah kami tidak bertanya kepadamu tentang ketaatan terhadap penguasa yang bertakwa yang kami tanyakan adalah ketaatan terhadap penguasa yang berbuat demikian dan demikian ia sebutkan kejelekan kejelekannya
7020593 akan ada sepeninggalku nanti para imam penguasa yang mereka itu tidak berpegang dengan petunjukku dan tidak mengikuti cara jalanku dan akan ada di antara para penguasa tersebut orang orang yang berhati setan namun berbadan manusia
7020594 hendaknya engkau mendengar dan menaati penguasa tersebut walaupun punggungmu dicambuk dan hartamu dirampas olehnya maka dengarkanlah perintahnya dan taatilah dia
7020595 seburuk buruk penguasa kalian adalah yang kalian benci dan mereka pun membenci kalian kalian mencaci mereka dan mereka pun mencaci kalian
7020596 jangan selama mereka masih mendirikan shalat di tengah tengah kalian dan jika kalian melihat mereka mengerjakan perbuatan yang tidak kalian sukai maka bencilah perbuatannya dan jangan mencabut meninggalkan ketaatan darinya
7020597 urusan kaum muslimin tidaklah stabil tanpa adanya penguasa yang baik atau yang jahat sekalipun
7020598 wahai amirul mukminin kalau penguasa yang baik kami bisa menerimanya lalu bagaimana dengan yang jahat
7020599 sesungguhnya walaupun penguasa itu jahat namun allah subhanahu wa taala tetap memerankannya sebagai pengawas keamanan di jalan jalan dan pemimpin dalam jihad
7020600 adapun kewajiban menaati mereka penguasa tetaplah berlaku walaupun mereka berbuat jahat karena tidak menaati mereka dalam hal yang maruf akan mengakibatkan kerusakan yang jauh lebih besar dari apa yang ada selama ini dan di dalam kesabaran terhadap kejahatan mereka itu terdapat ampunan dari dosa dosa serta mendatangkan pahala yang berlipat
7020601 ketahuilah bahwa kejahatan penguasa tidaklah menghapuskan kewajiban menaati mereka pen yang allah subhanahu wa taala wajibkan melalui lisan nabi nya kejahatannya akan kembali kepada dirinya sendiri sedangkan kebaikan kebaikan yang engkau kerjakan bersamanya akan mendapat pahala yang sempurna insya allah yakni kerjakanlah shalat berjamaah shalat jumat dan jihad bersama mereka dan juga berpartisipasilah bersamanya dalam semua jenis ketaatan yang dipimpinnya
7020602 telah sepakat para ulama ahli fiqh ilmu dan ahli ibadah dan juga dari kalangan ubbad ahli ibadah dan zuhhad orang orang zuhud sejak generasi pertama umat ini hingga masa kita ini bahwa shalat jumat idul fitri dan idul adha hari hari mina dan arafah jihad haji serta penyembelihan qurban dilakukan bersama penguasa yang baik ataupun yang jahat
7020603 aku telah bertemu dengan 1 000 orang lebih dari ulama hijaz makkah dan madinah kufah bashrah wasith baghdad syam dan mesir
7020604 aku tidak melihat adanya perbedaan di antara mereka tentang perkara berikut ini beliau lalu menyebutkan sekian perkara di antaranya kewajiban menaati penguasa dalam hal yang maruf
7020605 di dalam hadits ini riwayat al bukhari dan muslim dari shahabat abu hurairah di atas pen terdapat keterangan tentang kewajiban menaati para penguasa dalam perkara perkara yang bukan kemaksiatan adapun hikmahnya adalah untuk menjaga persatuan dan kebersamaan umat islam karena di dalam perpecahan terdapat kerusakan
7020606 shaum itu di hari kalian umat islam bershaum waktu berbuka adalah pada saat kalian berbuka dan waktu berkurban iedul adha di hari kalian berkurban

7020612 fay will be near or over the gulf coast of the western florida panhandle today and tonight and near or over the gulf coast of mississippi and alabama on sunday
7020613 fay is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches across the western portion of the northern florida peninsula the florida panhandle southwestern georgia and the southern half of both mississippi and alabama with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches possible
7020614 regardless of its exact track fay will be moving rather slowly during the next several days posing a significant heavy rainfall and flood hazard to a very large area
7020615 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage

7020690 we found that the odor profile coming from the skin of cancer patients was markedly different than that coming from healthy skin
7020691 researchers have speculated that tumors give off different odors but were the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved in skin cancer odors
7020692 within a few years its reasonable to say that this could end up being a diagnostic tool that would be a routine thing one could do in a doctors office its a real possibility
7020693 because when youre dealing with cancer the margin for error is really small you dont want to miss something that may be a cancer that then doesnt get treated and you dont want to treat someone for cancer if they actually have something else so its really a very novel and interesting idea but one which i think really needs to be further researched and carefully confirmed

7020720 the past few days have been extremely busy im now getting between 3 5 hours of sleep a night im ok for now but i know that when i get home ill probably sleep for an entire day one day i had absolutely no time to eat anything at all i hadn t showered for two days my last break in shooting was spent lying on a bed for 30 minutes and taking a quick shower my clothes need to be washed again ive had no time for shopping for souvenirs for the wife and kid i bought some postcards but the problem there is i need to find time to write something down and then mail them im falling asleep on short bus rides
7020721 after transmitting all of my photographs and packing up my gear i ended up sharing a elevator ride with a nice young lady and her two companions the companions i believe were pr folks but the young lady just happened to be the gold medal winner mariel zagunis and as we headed down to the first floor she pulled out the gold and let me hold it for just a second she never let go of it i think i got about three fingers on it i thought that was pretty cool

7020730 let all men know that grace comes after tribulation let them know that without the burden of afflictions it is impossible to reach the height of grace let them know that the gifts of grace increase as the struggles increase let men take care not to stray and be deceived this is the only true stairway to paradise and without the cross they can find no road to climb to heaven
7020731 hear o people hear o nations i am warning you about the commandment of christ by using words that came from his own lips we cannot obtain grace unless we suffer afflictions we must heap trouble upon trouble to attain a deep participation in the divine nature the glory of the sons of god and perfect happiness of soul
7020732 if only mortals would learn how great it is to possess divine grace how beautiful how noble how precious how many riches it hides within itself how many joys and delights without doubt they would devote all their care and concern to winning for themselves pains and afflictions all men throughout the world would seek trouble infirmities and torments instead of good fortune in order to attain the unfathomable treasure of grace this is the reward and the final gain of patience no one would complain about his cross or about troubles that may happen to him if he would come to know the scales on which they are weighed when they are distributed to men
7020733 catholic voters continue to support republican john mccain over democrat barack obama in the presidential race
7020734 mccain leads by nine percentage points in our two person head to head polling but there is still a significant slice who are yet undecided
7020735 catholic voters tell us they are more likely to be concerned about international issues than the average american voter and they also care more about social issues particularly abortion
7020736 mccains strength among catholic voters comes as russian troops moved into the republic of georgia and as he put in a strong straightforward performance at the saddleback civil forum in california
7020737 in that forum there was a clear distinction between mccain and obama on the question of when a human life begins and catholic voters may be responding warmly to mccains defense of his pro life stance at that forum

7020755 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgement and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7020756 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbour instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7020757 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7020758 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7020759 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

7020765 the conflict in south ossetia occurred because of the neglect of settlement of problems of this kind
7020766 it would be very easy for russia to organise a provocation and then the russian might stands ready to react
7020767 i am certain that such a south ossetia type scenario is not possible
7020768 our aim is to receive international guarantees of ukraines territorial integrity which is only possible in the framework of collective security
7020769 we have to do everything to prevent a domino effect if russia destabilises georgia ukraine and azerbaijan also home to russian backed rebels will be next
7020770 i dont know what russias strategy is toward ukraine but we must get ready
7020771 we wont leave them a single rifle or bullet so that they cant start any more wars

7020774 their feeling now is you made gains and you should keep them
7020775 after what happened their successes they are not really feeling constrained now
7020776 one of the russian war goals was to bring down this government and by economic pressure they hope to do that
7020777 bringing down the government was more likely their goal than conquering tbilisi

7020783 i always admired lisa i always liked her because she was tall and had good moves
7020784 when i first played with her i thought wow thats lisa leslie i was like a fan like can i take a picture and get an autograph i cant do that shes my teammate its a very humbling experience at the same time you cant ask for nothing better
7020785 obviously syl is the future and lisa has had the best talent in the world for so long which she still is on any given night the best player on the court and she has been in this tournament for us syl has this amazing athletic ability and once she gets it together shell be a scary sight a scary scary sight
7020786 you throw it up there sylvias going to get it
7020787 i think i finally felt it for the first time
7020788 i got emotional i didnt want anybody to see me tear up so i sat in the back for a little while just thinking about this whole thing all that we went through all the struggles and fights and hard work we had to do to get here

7020793 the world food situation new driving forces and required actions
7020794 food prices have been steadily decreasing since the green revolution but the days of falling food prices may be over
7020795 surging demand for feed food and fuel have recently led to drastic price increases which are not likely to fall in the foreseeable future due to low stocks and slow growing supplies of agricultural outputs climate change will also have a negative impact on food production compounding the challenge of meeting global food demand and potentially exacerbating hunger and malnutrition among the worlds poorest people
7020796 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want

7020834 it is an illusion to think there is anything fragile about the life of the earth surely this is the toughest membrane imaginable in the universe opaque to probability impermeable to death we are the delicate part transient and vulnerable as cilia
7020835 i believe with every fiber of my being im innocent
7020836 after giving this some thought ive decided that the only person you can trust is yourself
7020837 only canadians can buy apples from around the corner instead of apples from china
7020838 i believe that emmanuel has been unfairly treated because he had a lot of interest from many big clubs and he always told me one to one his preference was to stay in the end he stayed
7020839 that story did not come out like that in the press and unfortunately he is paying a price for a story which is not really him
7020840 he made a press conference in austria where people interpreted his statements a bit differently but i know what he told me and i know he made sacrifices to stay
7020841 i was convinced he wanted to stay but i was not always convinced he would stay because there is a big difference in that
7020842 people have advisors and some clubs pay higher wages than we do we have to accept that
7020843 it has been difficult securing national distribution we are still in talks with several companies weve yet to sign a deal documentaries are difficult to distribute so weve been told
7020844 this documentary was important because many people outside of hollywood think we actors and actresses have it made we are fortunate to do what we love however we have trials and tribulations like in any other profession i felt it was important to let our fans see us for who we are as well as discuss some of the issues facing african american actresses today they are not creating roles for us people need to know that in order to demand what they want to see
7020845 it was boring we were too guarded we werent ready
7020846 im interested in seeing the progression with the show said campbell at the start of the program
7020847 unfortunately the show is extremely heavy on the negative side being black in america isnt just this one big bad experience i believe its completely irresponsible i believe that too much of anything isnt good its one dimensional therefore inaccurate do we have these challenges yes are we hopeless victims absolutely no
7020848 i wished they would have said a bit more about hip hop music doing rap videos constantly its something i struggle with the images that are put out there
7020849 overall i dont feel like the piece gave an insight into black men in the way i thought it would
7020850 lets hope the ratings are good and potential other outlets like fox are open to more serious black programming
7020851 hollywood producers said its a nice project a great project where are the white heroes
7020852 politics have always had an impact on programming during an election campaign so there may be some recent correlation between oprahs endorsement of obama and the decline in her ratings but that would not account for a three year trend
7020853 the entire industry is experiencing some challenges in meeting the desires and taste of a multimedia consuming audience there is a technological shift taking place in the industry and as more people turn to the internet for information and programming television ratings will continue to suffer
7020854 in order to keep her edge oprah has to adapt to the change in audience habits
7020855 h praise tv speaking of the supposed queen of media
7020856 may be substantial enough to wipe out all of the gains anticipated to flow from the 12 new ownership diversity policies adopted by the commission in december 2007 and could even
7020857 you know the primary responsibility is for parents and i reject the notion of censorship as an approach to dealing with this problem
7020858 i do think that it is important for us to make sure that we are giving parents the tools that they need in order to monitor what their children are watching and obviously the problem we have now is not just whats coming over the airwaves but whats coming over the internet
7020859 the one other thing i will say is i dont mean to be insulting here but i do think that it is important for those in the industry to show some thought about who they are marketing some of these programs that are being produced to
7020860 i think obama has it right on censorship consistent with his position on other social issues he seems to be much more in favor of putting a greater responsibility on parents and communities to police what their children are watching its never been hollywoods responsibility to raise our kids and as program content becomes more and more violent and sexually explicit it is imperative that parents take a greater role in what their children watch and listen to
7020861 i also agree that the government should be active in making sure parents and other consumers are given the tools to censor what comes into their homes
7020862 sen obama does not support reimposing the fairness doctrine on broadcasters
7020863 he considers this debate to be a distraction from the conversation we should be having about opening up the airwaves and modern communications to as many diverse viewpoints as possible
7020864 i strongly favor diversity of ownership of outlets and protection against the excessive concentration of power in the hands of any one corporation interest or small group i strongly believe that all citizens should be able to receive information from the broadest range of sources
7020865 there is a clear need in this country for the reinvigoration of antitrust enforcement
7020866 the fccs loosening restrictions on media ownership in the 90s was a great disservice and allowed a few companies to control the majority of what we saw and heard
7020867 more regulations in this regard will allow for smaller broadcast outlets owned by diverse companies to get a place on the worlds stage america has always been about the marketplace of ideas but recently its been just a small kiosk hopefully obama will see that more players get a place at the broadcast table which is great for everyone and i hope minority broadcasters will be large part of the future
7020868 the neutral nature of the internet makes that possible and it is something we should defend up to now legislation has focused on protecting against the discrimination against or in favor of any single voice or legal service all have made allowances for objective nondiscriminatory network management practices
7020869 you know what not as difficult as it is being an asian girl

7020875 i am not retiring i am transitioning into doing other ventures
7020876 my husband and i have been married 31 years spending very little time together because of the demands of the industry now we want to spend time together with our children and grandchildren travel and enjoy life
7020877 as much as i could i tried i was very conscious of this and purposefully saying every department needs to be mixed we need women we need black people we need hispanics go out of your way to find that dont just call your friends because people like to think were all integrated in the business and its just not like that people call their friends thats why when white people go crazy about affirmative action im like you dont get it the reason why there is affirmative action is because you call your friends kids to work in the store and your friends are all white so yea i was very conscious of making sure there was a diverse cast and crew
7020878 yea iowa and illinois have a lot has had a lot of black and spanish people living there and when youre poor you really dont have time to be racist if you noticed like all the states that went to obama are poor states its those middle states like indiana that go white candidates because they have just enough money to be you know f up when we filmed league of their own in indiana f klan was there with a can asking for money this was in 1992 crew would quit because we had a black pa
7020879 around a million my next movie i want at least 8 or 10 million and i dont want to have to live like i did while filming
7020880 i learned that men cant hear you when you talk they respected me but i would be talking to them and they would just walk away
7020881 no its just programming during a basketball game scene i had a microphone but i ran into the same problem the guys werent listening im not being sexist but give a guy a basketball a car a gun you might as well forget it hes not going to listen to you
7020882 as you know no one gave women the right to vote no one gave slaves freedom no one is going to give you anything you have to take it you can have all the black screenwriter associations and women at lunch things but at the end of the day you just have to have a great script and then color goes away and sex goes away as long as you can make some money
7020883 how can two groups of people fight so long over the same problems
7020884 both campaigns indicate that any additional appearances will be open to all ne tworks for broadcast on tv or internet like the presidential commission debates rather than sponsored by a single network or news organization
7020885 if looks could kill www iflookscouldkill com campaign combines digital and real world gaming components centered around a new web site developed by mega black ad agency burrell communications group toyotas black marketing communications aor and agency partner 42 entertainment tells the a list he will debut a broadband network called the venture is being backed by private quity some wealthy famous people
7020886 at this point all of the programming is original and that is what separates us from any other urban destination
7020887 the content will consist of original movies and documentaries and stand up comedy specials our ability to provide original programming is what really excites the advertisers there is not another destination on the web that offers the unique content that we are providing

7020930 no positive result was stable enough to be reproduced by all investigators
7020931 there is little evidence to confirm the safety or efficacy of most alternative therapies much of the information currently known about these therapies makes it clear that many have not been shown to be efficacious well designed stringently controlled research should be done to evaluate the efficacy of alternative therapies
7020932 despite the available research it has proven difficult to produce clear clinical evidence that homeopathy works
7020933 its strength lies in its evident effectiveness as it takes a holistic approach towards the sick individual through promotion of inner balance at mental emotional spiritual and physical levels
7020934 im very angry about it because people are going to get malaria there is absolutely no reason to think that homeopathy works to prevent malaria and you wont find that in any textbook or journal of homeopathy so people will get malaria people may even die of malaria if they follow this advice
7020935 human basophil degranulation triggered by very dilute antiserum against ige
7020936 based on this evidence we would be ready to accept that homoeopathy can be efficacious if only the mechanism of action were more plausible
7020937 the evidence presented in this review would probably be sufficient for establishing homeopathy as a regular treatment for certain indications
7020938 the evidence of clinical trials is positive but not sufficient to draw definite conclusions
7020939 are the clinical effects of homeopathy placebo effects a meta analysis of placebo controlled trials
7020940 were not compatible with the hypothesis that the effects of homoeopathy are completely due to placebo
7020941 there is increasing evidence that more rigorous trials tend to yield less optimistic results than trials with less precautions against bias

7020963 it is the broker the means of detached and dispassionate interaction between parties with opposed interests buyers want a low price sellers wants a high price the market works out the price that exactly balances these desires a price that is fair because it is the market price
7020964 context of any transaction so long as that transaction is not directly dictated by the state the word has no content of its own because it is defined simply and by reasons of politics by what it is not the market is the nonstate and thus it can do everything the state can do but with none of the procedures or rules or limitations it is a disembodied decision maker a maxwells demon who somehow and without effort balances and reflects the preferences of everyone participating in economic decisions it can be these things precisely because it is nothing at all
7020965 can anyone in modern american politics deny the markets existence or even its relevance
7020966 to do so would be political suicide precisely like denying the existence of god
7020967 may be imperfect that under certain conditions it may fail

7020974 modern behavioral economics has begun to show that the actual behavior of presumptively competent people
7020975 ordinary intelligent people appear consistently unwilling or unable to calculate the consequences of their decisions in a manner predicted by the view that they are responding purely to the market instead they act as social beings concerned about their standing with their peers about the fairness of the deal they are being offered and other matters quite irrelevant to the utility of the object or money on offer
7020976 the autonomous individual is not the active agent who matters most advertising is propaganda and markets are controlled by large organizations that have the capacity to decide what will be produced
7020977 the capacity to adjust the presentation of such products to what research and experience indicate the public will actually buy

7020979 free to choose only among a menu of items set out for sale
7020980 the freedom to shop is for the rest of us an incident to this freedom
7020981 he concept of a freedom to shop has been extended insidiously into the realm of careers where it plays even greater havoc with the normal use of words in a free capitalist society with private schools and universities free to admit whom they please and charge what the market will bear the freedom to choose ones profession becomes in part the freedom to become what one can afford to become

7020995 i wouldnt say im a phenomenon im just a great athlete
7020996 i try and stay relaxed by messing around and not thinking too much about the race i dont allow people to put pressure on me you might not be focused enough when i enjoy myself i stay focused ill still enjoy myself im still young ill still train hard ill try to keep on top for as long as i can
7020997 running is enjoyable you have to enjoy what you do
7020998 its a job for us athletes its like working to not enjoy it it doesnt make sense

7021039 i want to thank them for the work they have done on behalf of the cabinet
7021040 at the same time though as we create a culture of integrity in the transportation cabinet we must ask everyone to live up to a higher standard of expectations and conduct even the mere perception of a potential conflict must if possible be avoided
7021041 the change order was presented to me for routine signature under the recommendations and signatures of two others contrary to my attempt to completely remove myself from any involvement in the project i signed the change order without reviewing the details
7021042 i regret any embarrassment this may cause to an administration that is attempting to make the transportation cabinet transparent and forthright
7021043 while i respect the work done by mr newman and mr gulick and have no reason to question their intent in this matter even the perception of a potential conflict must be avoided if we are to maintain the trust of the people we serve
7021044 if we are to create a culture of integrity in the transportation cabinet and throughout state government if we are to shore up the publics trust in our ability to look after their interests we must hold ourselves accountable to a standard of conduct that is more stringent than ever before

7021276 one of the kids his favorite player is alex and you could see it in his face when he came over
7021277 to see the smiles on the little kids that was the important thing
7021278 you do things for the kids and make them happy you have a nice game and we win it couldnt be a better day
7021279 yeah 2 501 thats what ill be thinking about tomorrow
7021280 let me get 1 501 before i worry about 3 000
7021281 i hope its not to be expected because im not expecting to do it
7021282 right now is the busiest ive ever been in my life
7021283 honestly it is exciting and exhilarating whereas some of my contemporaries are bemoaning the ageism in hollywood i seem to have discovered myself in brand new ventures i feel like im starting out
7021284 i got lucky enough to play kitty kat and i think that broke the ice
7021285 i think all of a sudden there was this whole new generation of filmmakers who looked at me and they are all much younger than me and they just said wait a minute shes hysterical and the last time we saw her she was a bond girl and im just thinking to myself how amazing is this my entire lifes work has not hit their radar its wonderful its like i have this brand new career
7021286 people just come up to me and get so excited because of dancing with the stars more so than any movie or television series ive ever done
7021287 i just think its such a comical character she always has the antidote for everything in her handbag
7021288 hes a regular guy when it comes to being a teammate
7021289 the thing ive gotten to learn about him is his work ethic is pretty impressive he knows hes a pretty special player hes gone about it impressively
7021290 we had a meeting with 25 players who felt like a team we havent felt like that for a week
7021291 evidently the boston thing was something he wanted to change
7021292 i had a great 12 years in new york managing the
7021293 the guys have received me with open arms its been great
7021294 it feels like im on vacation im here for another month or two after this i dont know whats going to happen im living day by day

7021301 the attorney generals investigation of possible fraud in the adult protocol has spread to the childrens version
7021302 at most the suspension indicates that state investigators fear fraud has occurred at the least it reflects nationwide unease with potential conflicts of interest between leading medical researchers and the pharmaceutical firms that fund much of their work
7021303 when you really look at the investigators involved and the procedures they followed they were all within what has been defined as appropriate in every medical field
7021304 to block access to this protocol is really hurting the people who need it most
7021305 theres much more influence relative to day to day prescribing
7021306 this attack is causing us to go back to the system we had before with individual doctors who may have individual influence instead of using a standardized protocol
7021307 in our country theres been a switch from taking care of people to focusing on big corporate money
7021308 there need to be restrictions on how these things are done because the victims are our children
7021309 the newer medications have no substantial advantage over the older medication
7021310 they were done on my own time and they followed all the guidelines

7021320 he brings enthusiasm and a lot of success as a publisher to his new role with the company farrow also brings big ideas to the job and possesses the motivational skills to put them into practice
7021321 despite what some people are saying newspapers continue to play an important role in small towns and cities and im thrilled to have the opportunity to have an impact on so many outstanding community newspapers
7021322 ken will be an asset in each of these cities

7021358 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
7021359 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7021360 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
7021361 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
7021362 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7021363 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7021364 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
7021365 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
7021366 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
7021367 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
7021368 if you trust every web site but not a government
7021369 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official is it possible that all news on the internet is accurate
7021370 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
7021371 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
7021372 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
7021373 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
7021374 people sat around wondering if it was the end and so did i
7021375 combination of toughness and restraint of will nerve and wisdom so brilliantly controlled so matchlessly calibrated
7021376 at the end we lucked out it was luck that prevented nuclear war at the end gestures by bringing thumb and forefinger together until they almost touch rational individuals kennedy was rational khrushchev was rational castro was rational rational individuals came that close to the total destruction of their societies

7021378 if all else failed his soviet allies had tactical nuclear weapons hidden in the hills behind tarara beach and other likely landing spots that could wipe out an american beachhead in a matter of minutes
7021379 and that was without the participation of soviet combat troops or the use of nuclear weapons

7021381 it is normal actually for him not to come back
7021382 it is an unfortunate comment at this time especially when we are driving young people to become more involved
7021383 we have to see it in the glory of their moment and give it to them
7021384 we have to allow the personality of youth to express itself
7021385 he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made
7021386 not this time he was fantastic we are very privileged to have this
7021387 demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
7021388 this makes him the most dangerous type of offender he remains a danger to children all over the world
7021389 his trial in vietnam a country which has been condemned by virtually every organisation concerned with justice and human rights as being a system of unfair justice and political trials was a charade was a travesty of justice
7021390 he never got a fair trial and in due course that will be expanded upon

7021403 nuclear weapon proliferation is the single most immediate threat hanging over the world today
7021404 turned its hand to new bunker busting nuclear weapons designed to attack underground facilities
7021405 the plain fact is there can be no non proliferation without de proliferation
7021406 that is if the weapons states are not prepared to rid themselves of nuclear weapons why would other states continue to deny themselves the kind of leverage which these weapons bring
7021407 the old order of victorious powers with major powers hanging onto weapons of massive destruction is a remnant of the violent 20th century
7021408 it cannot provide the basis for an equitable and effective system of world governance
7021409 just as world community concerns have been ahead of the political system on issues such as global warming so too world community concern needs to galvanise international action to find a new template for a lasting peace one embracing all the major powers and regions
7021410 this can be done but it requires leadership and imagination

7021458 sun is a large ship in mid turn and its low share price technology and customers could make it an attractive target to some larger players
7021459 theres a definite value in the technology that sun owns theres a ton of intellectual property
7021460 whenever people ask what is suns future then obviously the potential to be acquired comes in
7021461 i could be wrong but i think management is far more focused on fixing the business rather than selling the company
7021462 we are making changes to deliver consistent and expanding profitability
7021463 although the last two quarters were tough for sun we continue to see great progress
7021464 operationally i think sun is going down the right path but i just dont think the growth is being seen as quickly as investors want to see it
7021465 thats been out there for ages at least for the past decade
7021466 there is no doubt that the companys technology talent customer base and brand still command respect in the industry
7021467 if an acquirer could buy sun at a discounted price and then execute or facilitate the turnaround that has been close or elusive for sun it could represent a significant payoff

7021478 the agency lacks the budget the statutory authority and the scientific expertise to ensure the hundreds of nanoproducts now on the market among them baby bottle nipples infant teething rings paints waxes kitchenware and appliances are safe this problem will only worsen as more sophisticated nanotechnology based products begin to enter the consumer market
7021479 during the fall of 2007 many americans faced a hazard in their products that had been banned for 30 years lead as millions of childrens toys coated with lead paint were recalled it became clear that government oversight had failed and that the cpsc the agency primarily responsible for the oversight of these toys was stretched too thin from years of neglect underfunding and the challenges posed by an increasingly global manufacturing system
7021480 it is against this background that we need to ask the question is the cpsc adequately prepared to deal with nanotechnology which is now associated with more than 800 manufacturer identified consumer products ranging from infant pacifiers to paints to appliances to clothing
7021481 it took decades of research before lawmakers found the political will to keep lead and phthalates out of toys it could take a very long time to research and ensure that potentially dangerous nanomaterials are kept out too
7021482 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
7021483 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
7021484 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
7021485 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
7021486 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
7021487 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
7021488 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
7021489 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production
7021490 the licensing of these three companies in mexico marks an important step toward a national coverage and distribution outlets of our nano coating surface treatment within the mexican territory

7021494 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7021495 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7021496 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7021497 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7021504 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7021505 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7021507 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7021508 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7021509 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7021510 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7021511 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7021512 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7021513 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7021514 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7021515 in england in the national team i dont believe it
7021516 i dont believe this because lampard tries to do the best job for the national team and for chelsea
7021517 one time in portugal when i lost a match against spain people waved the white handkerchiefs afterwards they said they wanted me out
7021518 they booed me many times as portugal manager and players sometimes what i try to do is give confidence to the player because people sometimes do not understand what is happening with the whole team
7021519 its not one player that makes a team it is 11 i think england have very good players and lampard is one of these players
7021520 i asked frank today are you sad he said no i said i know why you are sad because now you renewed your contract and you have money you have to think about how to spend it he laughed
7021521 i dont know what the player wright phillips is thinking about with regards to offers from other teams
7021522 if i have 24 to 25 players with me and three or four for two positions then im happy i have three or four players in this wing right and wing left position
7021523 if the club sells one or two more players its not a problem for me

7021525 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7021526 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7021527 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7021528 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7021529 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7021530 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7021531 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7021532 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7021533 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7021534 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7021535 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

7021538 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo

7021540 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7021541 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional

7021543 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

7021548 what we have got to do with joey is just try to assess where his fitness is
7021549 it is all right to come in and play a game but how will he react after it
7021550 i am fully aware he has got his thing on september 5 and it is highly unlikely joey will be involved with us beforehand
7021551 if he was fit enough and looked strong enough and put himself up for selection that way i would play him before then
7021552 but at the moment it is looking unlikely just because of the work he has missed
7021553 mark viduka will probably be a couple of weeks still because unlike michael owen he missed the end of last season as well and unlike michael he has had an injection in his achilles
7021554 it will be a little bit longer for him but he is close he came back into training two days this week and was absolutely outstanding so it wont be long
7021555 claudio cacapa has not trained with us i was going to involve him at old trafford maybe play him but on the friday he just tweaked his hamstring
7021556 but he is not far off being fit again because it didnt go he just got a warning he had had one the week before so we just eased back on it
7021557 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

7021563 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
7021564 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
7021565 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
7021566 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
7021567 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
7021568 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
7021569 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
7021570 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production

7021577 i think its the wave of the future at least as far as low stakes games are concerned
7021578 it just makes so much sense for the casinos and i think once the players get used to it this is something that could be seen in poker rooms up and down the strip
7021579 the excalibur is a low end kind of room as far as stakes are concerned we think this product fits that group of players
7021580 the problem for casinos is that a lot of the time especially during off peak months they have a bunch of dealers in the poker rooms just sitting around because its just too hard to predict what kind of traffic youre going to get
7021581 if the casinos can save money on staffing then they can make more money and we all know thats the name of the game and the players dont have to pay as much rake so its good for everyone

7021586 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7021587 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7021588 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7021589 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7021590 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

7021592 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7021593 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7021594 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7021595 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7021596 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7021597 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7021598 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7021599 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7021600 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7021601 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7021602 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7021603 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7021604 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

7021608 la situaci n solo ha mejorado ligeramente tras el repliegue de las principales unidades de rusia pero sus tropas mantienen el control de varios territorios estrat gicos es decir que las fuerzas de ocupaci n contin an sus acciones militares

7021619 rice bran solubles are not the only way of getting nutrients to malnourished children
7021620 if aid agencies want to go down the bran solubles route why not wheat oat or barely bran solubles all these crops have ten times less total arsenic than rice and are just as nutrient rich
7021621 one would expect dietary supplements to be virtually free of unwanted substances like arsenic especially when aimed at children who are particularly vulnerable to arsenic
7021622 we totally agree with the overall message that it is important to set standards for inorganic arsenic in our food

7021671 anglian group is looking closely at its manufacturing capacity as economic uncertainty continues as a result of a deterioration in consumer confidence and spending the group is experiencing a downturn in sales and profitability
7021672 this review process has identified a number of potential redundancies and regretfully anglian has today announced a possible loss of up to 94 jobs from a total of 810 within its manufacturing division in norwich
7021673 the current proposals involve a restructure and are considered necessary in order to place the manufacturing division on a sound commercial and financial footing and thereby to secure the majority of the workforces jobs for the future
7021674 anglian appreciates this announcement inevitably leaves the workforce with a degree of uncertainty and acknowledges the anxiety which this obviously causes
7021675 the company will be commencing the redundancy consultation process with affected employees immediately and will endeavour to minimalise the concerns of employees wherever possible

7021702 now it depends on him whether he himself becomes president or nominates someone else
7021703 the iraqi government wants this agreement to be valid just for three years
7021704 the full withdrawal will depend on the situation on the ground and the needs of iraqis and the decisions of the iraqi government
7021705 the stronger person is always more respected and russia has become stronger

7021707 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularised by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer buffy the vampire slayer slaying church attendance among women study claims the dawning of a new dark age dust jacket hardcover direct from the publishers uk
7021708 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7021709 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7021710 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7021711 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7021712 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7021713 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7021714 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7021715 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7021716 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7021717 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7021718 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7021719 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7021720 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7021721 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7021722 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7021723 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7021724 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7021725 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7021726 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7021727 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7021728 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7021729 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7021730 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7021731 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7021732 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7021733 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7021734 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7021735 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7021736 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7021737 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7021738 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7021739 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7021740 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7021741 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7021742 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7021743 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7021744 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7021745 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7021746 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7021747 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7021748 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7021749 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7021750 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7021751 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7021752 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7021753 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7021754 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7021755 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7021756 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7021757 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7021758 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7021759 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7021760 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7021761 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7021762 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7021763 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7021764 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7021765 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7021766 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7021767 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7021768 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7021769 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7021770 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

7021773 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7021774 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7021775 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7021776 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7021777 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7021778 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7021779 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7021780 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7021781 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7021782 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

7021786 its the same stuff that any good adventure game is made of travel between interesting locations engage in conversation to receive valuable clues and put everything together to form logical solutions but in this world everythings firmly on the silly side strong bads map is a colorful nonlinear quick travel button you can place newly discovered locations on the map wherever you wish discussions shun dialogue choices in favor of goofy icons its much funnier when youre not quite sure whats going to happen and oddball puzzle solutions make perfect sense when you start to think like a cartoon character homestar ruiner and hopefully the balance of strong bads five episode starting season is a welcome evolution of everything telltale learned from making sam amp max and strong bads quirky colorful world is perhaps even better suited to the format in terms of both genre and storytelling structure at times like this its a wonder that adventure games ever went off the rails

7021809 as pessoas que gostam de beber um pouco mais tendem a se reunir nas casas dos familiares ou amigos mais pr ximos para poder beber sem se preocupar ficamos mais vontade sim
7021810 eu acredito que com a lei seca as pessoas estejam bebendo um pouco mais preocupadas com a dosagem mas elas n o deixaram de beber e dirigir

7021812 die von experten genannten risken f r den handel und die konsumg terindustrie durch den klimawandel k nnen auch als chance gesehen werden sowohl aus kologischen als auch konomischen gesichtspunkten

7021838 this ranking is another independent confirmation of the commitment of the entire duquesne community to academic excellence
7021839 i commend our faculty staff and administrators for setting and meeting such high standards and for the extraordinary and pervasive focus on our mission
7021840 the police department the fire department the paramedics were wonderful
7021841 i like to think that someone would do it for me
7021842 im just thankful to god he gave me the strength to get over the fence because im kind of a messed up person right now
7021843 i want to help the community and be a part of it and be a leader
7021844 i think its going to take off were doing a lot more business this year than last year
7021845 people arent used to us very much yet a lot are interested in riding but are timid to ask how much it costs
7021846 i do this because its fun i get exercise and i enjoy meeting people
7021847 its a different enough form of taxi service it wont take away from them he wont take people at 2 in the morning to dry creek road
7021848 as much as i support green transportation i would most certainly say it would hurt our business
7021849 this is a good place to draw the line in the sand
7021850 i cant imagine a project that would have more public benefit than this
7021851 its premature to give you a pro or con at this point when the studies have not been done
7021852 basically giving up some marginal timber ground on the ridge tops

7021859 regardless of the obvious dangers some people will ride bikes in san francisco for the same reason islamic fanatics will engage in suicide bombings because they are politically motivated to do so
7021860 in case anyone doubted that you were a wingnut this statement pretty much sums things up
7021861 basically he said this is the only option to return and she said no
7021862 we are backing tanya in whatever decision she wants to make
7021863 they should let tatsiana go back to belarus sooner rather than later tomorrow is the last chance for her to get on an airplane go to belarus get reunited with her grandmother finish her studies and do everything the right way
7021864 the decision of tatsiana and the zapatas to stay here creates a bad and dangerous precedent
7021865 it means that other children from belarus on summer respite can take advantage of the situation of staying in the u s to apply for legalization and stay
7021866 we believe the sooner she returns the better but she is our citizen
7021867 if she chooses to return she will always be welcome
7021868 decisions that are not in tanyas best interest are being made by people who are not her legal guardians
7021869 the decision of the zapata family to hold the child violates the provision of the agreement
7021870 even with all these things that were offered to her she is still fearful very fearful to go back her life isnt going to be normal there anymore
7021871 my question to belarus was why are you offering princess tanya all of these things but you didnt care about the 1 400 other children whose program you were canceling why are you pushing so far for this one child
7021872 when the zapatas go to bed at night they should lie there and think of 1 400 children that are crying and hoping that they can see their american mama and their american papa next year
7021873 children crying big tears because one family has decided to be selfish in keeping her
7021874 i dont know what is legally available to her now
7021875 i havent dug too far i will now as soon as i have an extra moment i will start now

7021938 i think that game the second one dayer is gone its different conditions different wickets in colombo i expect our batsmen to come good on sunday
7021939 it is a different wicket and a lot firmer than what it used to be the ball will come to bat and there will be more runs the batsmen hold the key and they have to put runs on the board they are the ones who control the game
7021940 you cant say that their indias batting was fragile you probably have to give a bit more credit for our bowlers and the conditions i think they will come back strongly but we are also prepared
7021941 vaas bowled both the days and batted and has not complained or anything he looks pretty good we will have another look on sunday as well it is only stiffness right now there is a very good chance that he will play

7021951 bull markets are born on pessimism grow on scepticism mature on optimism and die on euphoria
7021952 bargain hunters must rely on their own assessment of whether the stock price is far enough below what they believe a company is worth this is the sole guiding light on the horizon and scepticism is the compass

7021961 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
7021962 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic
7021963 circumvents every rational practice in child welfare that im aware of

7021971 and chapman would help you get to that reach that goal
7021972 well given my research of what id like to experience in an institution and in consideration of what is expected of me to attend college by those who have ushered me through this linear institutional path to success then yeah chapman would help me reach my ultimate goal but thats not questioning so many different venues of plausible successful roads to happiness
7021973 i got to get out of here i got to get out of utah
7021974 right and now that thats all gone i want a goal i just want to be happy i want to be just like i said a traveling vagrant my dad says what will you do if virginia doesnt work out what if you live out there for school and something happens to you and i said honestly daddy id take a train to boston and tough it out there and he said you cant you just cant why cant i im not saying you cant survive that you cant do it but youre a girl andrea your a girl and thats so fucked up i said

7021983 inspiration can be anything it can be a voice an image it can be a deep moment of personal desperation with ragtime i was facing the wall of my study in my house in new rochelle and so i started to write about the wall then i wrote about the house that was attached to the wall it was built in 1906 you see so i thought about the era and one thing led to another and thats the way the book began
7021984 was of the muddy seat of a little girls drawers in a pear tree where she could see through a window where her grandmothers funeral was taking place
7021985 i have a big folder of ideas and when it comes time for me to write a new book ill pull it out and go over everything thats in there

7021996 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7021997 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7021998 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest

7022002 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7022003 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7022004 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7022005 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7022006 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7022007 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7022008 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7022009 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7022010 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7022011 hay un miedo que subyace y es que se repita lo que pas con el yak 42

7022015 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7022016 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7022017 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7022018 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7022019 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7022020 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7022021 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7022022 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7022023 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7022024 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7022025 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7022026 the president has made it clear several times until now america was russias advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community
7022027 in this crisis situation we cant start taking options off the table the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are
7022028 i am informing you that i gave away the precious thing that i have in which it became very cheap which is my own self to lift up the oppression that is upon us through the american government
7022029 i did not like the tube in my mouth now go ahead and accept the rope in my neck
7022030 although many of the individuals apprehended during the raid have strong connections to al qaeda there is no credible information to suggest ahmed received terrorist related training or is a member of the al qaeda network
7022031 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7022032 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7022033 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7022034 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7022035 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7022036 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7022037 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7022038 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7022039 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7022040 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7022041 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7022042 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7022043 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7022044 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7022045 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7022046 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7022047 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7022048 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7022049 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7022050 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7022051 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7022052 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7022053 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7022054 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7022055 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7022056 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7022057 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7022058 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7022059 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7022060 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7022061 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7022062 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7022063 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7022064 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7022065 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7022066 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7022067 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7022068 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7022069 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7022070 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7022071 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7022072 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7022073 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7022074 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7022075 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7022076 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7022077 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7022078 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7022079 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7022080 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7022081 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7022082 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7022083 this is a planning took where all things are going
7022084 if not moderates may find that they have no choice but to make common cause with extremists just as the shahs opponents did in iran three decades ago
7022085 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7022086 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7022087 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7022088 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7022089 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7022090 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7022091 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7022092 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7022093 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7022094 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7022095 bisogna nascondere quel che guasta lumore dei potenti e limpasto di sempre ipocrisia e arroganza del potere
7022096 noi villan sempre allegri bisogna stare ch il nostro piangere fa male al re fa male al ricco e al cardinale diventan tristi se noi piangiam
7022097 dr oz recognizes that the spiritual is connected with the medical i love him because he likes to combine eastern and western medicine like acupuncture and massage
7022098 he has a true passion for the human body and has helped me understand things about the way it works
7022099 i do it because of how it makes me feel
7022100 same with surgery when families thank me im respectful but i dont feel comfortable not better or worse when people say nice job after a show thats not why i do it
7022101 i began to see why healing required more than my 11 blade
7022102 not just how to keep them alive but what kept them going
7022103 we were so used to treating the disease that we had forgotten to treat the patient
7022104 what oprah taught me more than anything else is that as a physician i shouldnt get tied down to the content
7022105 i should get tied down to the emotions underlying the motivation thats where the battle has to be waged
7022106 its not just about understanding the words but it has to resonate
7022107 so that people sit back at home and say thats right ive got to do that she taught me a lot about that

7022114 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7022115 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7022116 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7022117 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7022118 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president

7022121 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
7022122 experiments indicate that the advantages of these devices are such that human operators will be greatly enhanced for things like photo reconnaissance and so on

7022141 then you acknowledged in all humility that god had certainly not deceived you since he accepted you since he accepted your earthly wishes and foolish desires exchanged them for you and gave you instead heavenly consolation and holy thoughts that he did not treat you unfairly when he denied you your wish but for compensation created this faith in your heart when instead of the wish which even if it could do everything was at most able to give you the whole world he gave you faith through which you gained god and overcame the whole world

7022217 heidi is now trying to convince her husband that synchronized swimming is
7022218 today she experimented with no naptime a brave move on her part with the intention of getting the certain little boy to sleep earlier at night and later in the morning which will be important for many reasons however is this risk of major meltdown really worth it
7022219 again heidi is on the phone with a doctors office from a doctors office she tries to nicely explain to the office person that she doesnt know what she is doing because the referral did not go through for the fifth time and she is standing there at the appointment holding up everything because they dont know how to put in a referral correctly meanwhile the certain little boy frolics luckily little boy blue sleeps and heidi about loses her limited patience
7022220 i think it is an outright terrible decision on obamas part to pick biden yes he helps balance obamas inexperience on foreign policy but he also reminds people of it yes biden could conceivably be effective as an attack dog but biden is such a gasbag he makes the hindenburg look like a sack of rocks
7022221 the candidate of change went with the status quo marc ambinder

7022229 afghan president hamid karzai strongly condemns the uncoordinated air strike by coalition forces in shindand district of herat province which resulted in the death of at least 70 people including women and children
7022230 coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives an investigation has been directed
7022231 people didnt accept the aid and started throwing stones at the soldiers saying the afghan army is our enemy we dont want anything from our enemies
7022232 we will continue our demonstration until the international community listen to us and bring those who carried out yesterdays attack to justice
7022233 with either good or bad intelligence the most important lesson to learn from this is that we need to rely more on ground troops
7022234 since nato and the coalition dont have these troops the reliance on air support is greater so if they can increase their ground operations it would probably alleviate some of these problems
7022235 this is a civilian house and regretfully when a bombing takes place an aerial bombing or any kind of smart bombing definitely you will have these kind of regretful casualities
7022236 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be

7022238 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes

7022361 no one should have to choose between buying food and buying fuel this winter with home heating prices climbing through the roof we must give the hard pressed consumers of connecticut as much help as possible
7022362 it will be a matter of life or death for some people on whether they can keep the heat on in their homes or apartments
7022363 we have to go back to our board and figure out how many gallons of oil that will buy
7022364 were going to have to bolster our fuel banks with additional staff the phones are going to be ringing off the hook we want to make sure our dollars get stretched we have a tremendous amount of need
7022365 were sort of the catch basin when people fall through the cracks unfortunately that crack has become a schism
7022366 we are reacting to it now because an election is 75 days away
7022367 we should have been doing this during our regular session
7022368 we have a budget deficit and its not responsible to spend all of the surplus
7022369 any random drug testing is going to infringe on privacy
7022370 it doesnt seem like a wise use of resources in the present economy besides invading peoples privacy
7022371 it could be considered unconstitutional i havent seen the details but more than that its overkill
7022372 drug testing is increasing in just about every level not only in government but also in the private sector
7022373 im going to decline to comment on what the 9th circuit says is appropriate
7022374 but i would say that generally speaking drug testing has been upheld as constitutional and appropriate not only in government but in the private sector and schools as well
7022375 i think that the reasoning is solid and compelling and that the courts if this is done correctly that we would be successful in a challenge
7022376 the employer may have a legitimate interest to protect but it could be a fishing expedition and a way to enforce some kind of social commentary that they dont like people who smoke marijuana
7022377 i cant tell whether there is a special need for this but we just want the process to be fair and confidential
7022378 we will have plenty of food drink and tissues boxes
7022379 i boo hooed when he got the nomination i am going to cry like a baby when he accepts it
7022380 from a black perspective it holds a great deal of meaning
7022381 what we read into it is we are further down the road to achieving dr kings dream
7022382 the feeling i got was so emotional i was on fire
7022383 that was 45 years ago and i can still remember where i was what i was doing when i heard kings speech if i live another 45 years i imagine i will remember the emotions i will feel when barack obama accepts the presidential nomination of the democratic party
7022384 for me it is the 40th anniversary of watching julian bond on stage being nominated for vice president
7022385 as a 16 year old seeing this handsome articulate black man made me think why cant he be vice president i joined the young democrats i saw the possibility in 1968
7022386 he gives me hope that the way government is now will change
7022387 in 2004 24 1 million people voted in the democratic primaries in 2008 primaries 56 million voted a lot of that was youth and a large percentage of that is black youth
7022388 in some states particularly in the south black young people are voting more than young whites
7022389 weve turned the corner in race relations if barack obama is elected
7022390 if you go all the way to my door the water is up to here
7022391 ive been here all my life and ive never seen this creek come this far up
7022392 any random drug testing is going to infringe on privacy
7022393 it doesnt seem like a wise use of resources in the present economy besides invading peoples privacy
7022394 it could be considered unconstitutional i havent seen the details but more than that its overkill

7022400 i cant tell whether there is a special need for this but we just want the process to be fair and confidential
7022401 there are lots of people in this world who have more money than i do and spend it unwisely
7022402 she puts a tremendous amount of faith and trust in people
7022403 she wants to deal with people and agencies that are highly responsive and effective
7022404 she has a very caring heart for the hungry and needy
7022405 the state police major crimes unit photographed him verified his social security number but you can tell just from looking at the photos its not jaliek
7022406 consider everything thats out there as being in standing water
7022407 it has become this way over the last couple of months or so but its happening to many nonprofits
7022408 weve definitely seen our full schedule the past few weeks as the bills are higher and the needs are there
7022409 theyre just trying to meet their normally budgeted expenses if one thing rises that throws them completely off
7022410 they may be granted the maximum amount that a particular organization offers and then go to another for the remainder of the bill
7022411 its 211s job to help the majority of the assistance comes from organizations like salvation army and other nonprofit and faith based foundations
7022412 every penny of the contribution goes to light a life
7022413 its for any utility bill and its a year round program not just during the summer
7022414 we think its a tremendous way for generous customers to help others in need
7022415 we cant control fuel costs the market does that but this is the way that we can offset the costs
7022416 we prorate our money so that we can always open our doors every morning
7022417 people in tulsa who are funding a large part of us are well aware of this and trying to help and support
7022418 its unfortunate that this is how its always been because theres only a certain amount we can allot to each bill
7022419 theres always a need for more money to help if you can afford to help please do

7022424 it really brings the point home that their loved ones arent coming home
7022425 i almost sort of wanted to sneak in and not have anyone notice that i came home because those are the real heroes
7022426 my heart goes out to their families its a tremendous loss
7022427 i almost feel guilty because weve lost three more soldiers
7022428 and here i am just overwhelmed and so filled with joy that my husband is home and so grateful that hes home alive
7022429 the whole focus was to allow them to survive once were ready to leave
7022430 it was probably the best time ive ever had in my life not for fun but for self fulfilment
7022431 they really want to be able to take their country over for themselves but they know they cant do it they need help
7022432 i was into their music even though they were not in my generation
7022433 it was great going to school and wouldnt get out twelve sometimes even fouteen hour per day in that building having lessons practicing or jamming

7022437 what im concerned about is the 70 minutes of football ahead of us in a fortnights time not what has happened in latter years its still a green field with four flags and a referee and a ball
7022438 everyone wants to talk about it if you ask anyone about their memories of crystal beach you can basically sit down and be quiet for the next 20 minutes
7022439 i know both canadians and americans have a fondness for the other side of the bridge and i think we have to find ways to unite each other
7022440 and crystal beach park is a real testament to that
7022441 one woman in the show says we loved our american friends this was one place that really united both sides of the border
7022442 by 1946 people would stand around and watch the cyclone but they wouldnt ride it
7022443 i didnt grow up here i never went to crystal beach
7022444 at first i felt humbled and thought am i even worthy to do this program so many people on both sides of the border have first hand memories
7022445 but through their footage and images and memorabilia i got to know the park in a truly interesting way

7022477 afghan president hamid karzai strongly condemns the uncoordinated air strike by coalition forces in shindand district of herat province which resulted in the death of at least 70 people including women and children
7022478 our reports from our own forces on the ground are only so far that those killed in the strikes were 30 and they were all militants
7022479 all allegations of civilian casualties are taken very seriously coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives
7022480 it is imperative that we exercise caution before jumping to any conclusions the issue of civilian casualties is so important that it is vital that we verify the facts of what has actually happened
7022481 it is a matter of great concern that we are seeing reports of large numbers of civilian casualties the first rule of any counter insurgency operation is to do no harm
7022482 people didnt accept the aid and started throwing stones at the soldiers saying the afghan army is our enemy we dont want anything from our enemies

7022554 soccer trivia is a triva program covering soccer football history
7022555 it was just a matter of trying to see something upfield and trying to get a gap just going back to a lackadaisical stage of i know im going to catch it and just trying to make a move and get a big play for our offense
7022556 as i mentioned to the team there are going to be four or five areas where were going to have to buckle down and improve before we get into the regular season because were running out of time
7022557 certainly im not concerned about it were going to identify it as a staff and move on
7022558 ive never seen a team like that before man ive never seen a team in my life play like that
7022559 i hope the nfl looks at it and really views hard at it the first two preseason games they were doing the same thing and this might have been the worst ive seen yet
7022560 i have always been one of those fun guys trying to get guys loose but i have been kind of quieter and i need to get the guys looser he said
7022561 guys were going through the motions doing what the play says but we need a little bit more out of everybody period i am not pointing no fingers at anyone we are a team first and that is the biggest thing
7022562 when you come into someone elses house and get the ball first its definitely good to start off like we did we have to continue to keep working and go back to practice overall we made some good plays there is a lot of hard work that we have to do the first game of the regular season is coming up fast
7022563 you have to take what the defense gives you if we dont make the plays and get the first downs that we need then three points is good as well yes we definitely need to get into the end zone it will be a big relief for the offense and pretty much everybody
7022564 we did ok there are still some things that we need to iron out as an offense but overall we came into the game pretty well at the same time i say that we need a little bit more excitement as an offense we need to have fun out there making that block or making that catch we have to bring a little bit more excitement to our offense and right now we arent getting it im going to be one of the guys that will try to bring it out more and have more fun we have to stop thinking so much and just play offense im usually the funny guy and the joking guy to get guys loose im going to get back to getting the guys loose again
7022565 i was anxious to get back it was an opportunity to get back see the fans that i love and play against some of the old guys
7022566 we have a lot that we need to work on we need to return the ball better and put points on the board this was a game where we probably should have put some points on the board we needed to stick to what we do and not get caught up in some of there antics that they do after the whistle we have a little ways to go
7022567 we got a lot of three and outs tonight we didnt allow them to move the ball we did some good things in the first half you know weve got something to build upon we made some mistakes and we have to get better
7022568 well we will go into green bay next weekend and hopefully end the preseason on a high note but really its not about focusing on beating the packers next week its all about opening day and taking care of business against jacksonville
7022569 yeah it was all about establishing our identity we needed to let the falcons know we can play whatever kind of game they want to play
7022570 its hard to keep your composure in situations like that but we decided if they wanted to play like that then we would play their game for 60 minutes were going to go out there as a team play as a team and win as a team

7022572 so far as i heard she is not satisfied with the present condition during this visit of mr gambari
7022573 our study shows that if you have a dense rigid matrix the cells will be more aggressive and invasive its a direct effect
7022574 if you have enough invadopodia over time theyll make large holes that cells can move through to invade and metastasize
7022575 we thought that more stuff for the cells to get through was going to make it harder so we expected to see less matrix degradation but instead we found this interesting effect where cells actually sense the rigidity and degrade more
7022576 the idea that tissue rigidity leads to a more aggressive phenotype had been out there for a while but it hadnt actually been tied to matrix degradation which is thought to be important for metastasis and spread of cells through the body

7022589 i heard about the pigeon pill and i think its a good idea provided only the pigeons get hold of it
7022590 while we would applaud any pigeon control programme that is non lethal and humane the contraceptive ovocontrol p has a long way to go before it satisfies picas uk that it is wholly non lethal humane and cost effective
7022591 there is absolutely no need to use a pharmaceutical product to reduce pigeon numbers

7022594 boeing spokesman dan beck said the company needs six months to put together a new bid because it thinks the air force has changed the requirements and is now asking for a plane that can carry more fuel

7022701 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7022702 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7022703 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of each of those countries
7022704 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7022705 picking biden is practically a concession by obama that he is not prepared for the presidency and that he needs a tutor or mentor for the job

7022715 he might go quite astray in this maze and alyoshas heart could not endure uncertainty because his love was always of an active character he was incapable of passive love if he loved anyone he set to work at once to help him and to do so he must know what he was aiming at he must know for certain what was best for each and having ascertained this it was natural for him to help them both but instead of a definite aim he found nothing but uncertainty and perplexity on all sides
7022716 i am conscious of this irresistible feeling in my heart and it compels me irresistibly but it may all be put in two words ive already decided even if he marries that creature
7022717 whom i never never can forgive even then i will not abandon him henceforward i will never never abandon him
7022718 not that i would run after him continually get in his way and worry him oh no i will go away to another town where you like but i will watch over him all my life i will watch over him all my life unceasingly when he becomes unhappy with that woman and that is bound to happen quite soon let him come to me and he will find a friend a sister only a sister of course and so for ever but he will learn at least that that sister is really his sister who loves him and has sacrificed all her life to him i will gain my point i will insist on his knowing me confiding entirely in me without reserve
7022719 i will be a god to whom he can pray
7022720 what for anyone else would be only a promise is for her an everlasting burdensome grim perhaps but unflagging duty and she will be sustained by the feeling of this duty being fulfilled your life katerina ivanovna will henceforth be spent in painful brooding over your own feelings your own heroism and your own suffering but in the end that suffering will be softened and will pass into sweet contemplation of the fulfilment of a bold and proud design yes proud it certainly is and desperate in any case but a triumph for you and the consciousness of it will at last be a source of complete satisfaction and will make you resigned to everything else

7022734 this is the sort of thing that is going to just further undermine our confidence among voters in the voting technology thats being used very widely right now
7022735 theres already been widespread criticism of the touchscreen technology and the lack of paper trail which means you dont have a meaningful recount capability
7022736 i would expect that over the next couple years as we move toward 2010 and 12 well likely see more movement and maybe a further push from congress toward setting up some kind of uniform national system were probably the only major democracy in the world that has this kind of highly decentralized system now
7022737 it makes designing the ballot and coming up with an efficient method of recording and counting votes much more complicated
7022738 testing software is actually a lot of work and its hard
7022739 you want to get that out there where everybody can feed on it and make it really robust

7022747 sun is a large ship in mid turn and its low share price technology and customers could make it an attractive target to some larger players
7022748 theres a definite value in the technology that sun owns theres a ton of intellectual property
7022749 whenever people ask what is suns future then obviously the potential to be acquired comes in
7022750 i could be wrong but i think management is far more focused on fixing the business rather than selling the company
7022751 we are making changes to deliver consistent and expanding profitability
7022752 although the last two quarters were tough for sun we continue to see great progress
7022753 operationally i think sun is going down the right path but i just dont think the growth is being seen as quickly as investors want to see it
7022754 thats been out there for ages at least for the past decade
7022755 there is no doubt that the companys technology talent customer base and brand still command respect in the industry
7022756 if an acquirer could buy sun at a discounted price and then execute or facilitate the turnaround that has been close or elusive for sun it could represent a significant payoff
7022757 its certainly true now is the time to strike when the iron is hot

7022810 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
7022811 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7022812 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
7022813 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
7022814 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7022815 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7022816 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
7022817 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
7022818 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
7022819 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
7022820 if you trust every web site but not a government
7022821 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official is it possible that all news on the internet is accurate
7022822 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
7022823 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
7022824 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
7022825 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including
7022826 this book is an excellent systematic exploration of ideas and techniques in programming language theory the book carefully but without wasting time on extraneous complications explains operational and denotational semantic techniques and their application to many aspects of programming language design it will be of great value for graduate courses and for self study
7022827 there is a paucity of good graduate level textbooks on the foundations of programming languages no more than four or five in the last two decades nothing to compare with the profusion of excellent texts in the other core areas of computer science such as algorithms or operating systems this new textbook by franklyn turbak david gifford and mark sheldon comprehensive thorough pedagogically innovative impeccably written and organized greatly enriches the area of programming languages and will be an important reference for years to come

7022835 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7022836 this is the sort of thing that is going to just further undermine our confidence among voters in the voting technology thats being used very widely right now
7022837 theres already been widespread criticism of the touchscreen technology and the lack of paper trail which means you dont have a meaningful recount capability
7022838 i would expect that over the next couple years as we move toward 2010 and 12 well likely see more movement and maybe a further push from congress toward setting up some kind of uniform national system were probably the only major democracy in the world that has this kind of highly decentralized system now
7022839 it makes designing the ballot and coming up with an efficient method of recording and counting votes much more complicated

7022848 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7022849 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7023003 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
7023004 it is obvious that 17 year old boys getting behind the wheel of a high performance car is asking for trouble mr carpenter said
7023005 weve got to stop that from happening its about the safety of the broader community and the safety of the young kids themselves
7023006 and ordinary people do not want to be terrorised by hoons some of these accidents have come ploughing into peoples houses
7023007 but as a general rule young kids invariably boys dont need as their first vehicle to be driving a high performance car mr carpenter said
7023008 rather than the vehicle being crushed and effectively becoming worthless the vehicle should be sold and the money go into the road trauma trust fund he said
7023009 so it will be directly earmarked to assist people who have been injured in car accidents
7023010 it is not as superficially attractive as crushing the cars but it makes more sense because you get a return
7023011 a 17 year old drunk driving a stolen car with a 14 year old passenger hit me head on mr hewson said
7023012 the 14 year old died at the scene and four days later the driver died
7023013 this is such an awesome sponsor for our team at bristol
7023014 the television series knight rider is a show that everyone can get hooked on i think its really cool that nbc has chosen to reinvent the series for the fall line up the best part about the show was always the car kitt and this is amazing that i get to drive a version of kitt for the night race at bristol its every guys dream to feel like they are an action hero and i get to have that chance under the lights of bristol with our no 28 knight rider ford

7023021 alguns pisam no freio e aparecem diretamente na sua frente
7023022 fui o mais r pido que eu podia mas eu preferiria n o ter tocado no muro
7023023 para ser honesto a conclus o da reuni o foi que ningu m estava preparado para discutir muito pois estamos finalizando a rea da fota parte da discuss o foi sobre como garantir que reteremos algumas das menores equipes mas ningu m nesse est gio quer ficar envolvido na discuss o porque a fota tem um papel na atividade
7023024 estamos finalizando o pacto de conc rdia e queremos fazer algumas emendas para assegurar o futuro de todos os times
7023025 n o podemos afrouxar precisamos sair definitivamente dessa zona com muita firmeza e propriedade pela situa o que estamos precisamos tentar vencer independentemente do local a vantagem de jogar em casa pequena
7023026 obviously we have always thought of him as a starter and thats how we think about him
7023027 but there is not a lot of time to build him up obviously when a starter comes back you need time to build him up
7023028 its up to girardi and pitching coach dave eiland how they want to do it they know what theyre doing and the doctors obviously know
7023029 i dont think having brett favre on their team is going to put any pressure on us if anything its on them
7023030 im sure having brett having on their sideline is going to create a lot of excitement for their players and their fans
7023031 we dont play em in the regular season so this is going to be like the real big game especially for the young guys people who havent been through it this is my sixth year ive been through this a bunch of times but for the young guys who dont really know what its like to be in an actual game atmosphere i think theyll get a real taste of it this week
7023032 if really felt kind of weird the first time we came here and saw all those green jerseys and they werent cheering for us
7023033 the weirdest part is guys are talking about ticket situations and we got upper nose bleed im like man this is
7023034 they achieved something that every player wants to be able to watch it to be a witness of it was a good thing
7023035 someday that was in the back of my mind that someday we can do that and see what its like and feel the excitement and the buzz i had chills in my body watching it and i wasnt even a part of the team
7023036 no theyre a real humble group they have a lot of great players there theyre a great team what they achieved is the ultimate goal
7023037 theyll do it just like every other post super bowl winners try to get it again this year theyre trying to repeat my hats off to them i wish them the best of luck
7023038 the thing about football is you never know whos going to be in the final game
7023039 you have a lot of lead up hype with teams you expect to be there everybody expected the patriots and they held their end of the bargain they reached the game the giants they got hot at the right time
7023040 but the giants had a great run and they deserved it you always envy the team that wins the super bowl
7023041 theyre super bowl champions thats a pretty good gauge for this time of year
7023042 its the one thing we havent been able to do to get this win is huge
7023043 i felt good about the way we swung the bats and our approach tonight
7023044 that was pretty good did you see the other two games i pitched against them
7023045 i could have been better i could have been sharper
7023046 when you win a game like tonight it makes you feel good about tomorrow
7023047 its a big start for pav but we are swinging the bats good
7023048 i hope we all have last year in the back of minds to serve as a motivating force down the stretch
7023049 but i think this stretch of baseball has officially ended any negative impact that might have carried over into the season
7023050 you would hope that chemistry would not be determined by winning but that it is defined by having enough faith in the person next to you to embrace him when he is struggling
7023051 this is a difficult situation even for castillo weve played extremely well without him weve put ourselves in the pennant race he wouldnt want to mess that up for the team its kind of touchy
7023052 but luis is a one time world champion who is accustomed to winning so you cant dismiss that as well
7023053 technology on fast forward 2006 to 2011 us dvr forecast
7023054 if we get what we had with him in the first part of the year it would be a tremendous addition to our lineup and our defense as well
7023055 i knew i was going to come back i just didnt know when
7023056 hopefully its over with and done with and i dont ever have to deal with this type of injury again
7023057 that means they know its going to be a close game
7023058 he looks like the same pitcher who dominated us with the twins when i was managing the white sox
7023059 santana had mentioned that the other guy was still out there
7023060 i thought that for what hes done on the mound i had to give him the benefit of the doubt i thought that was only fair to him
7023061 right now weve got a great momentum going and everything is right there in front of us so i know i need to do my part to help out
7023062 at this point in the season you want to show youre able to go deep in the game we need that now even more because we dont have billy so what happened tonight was very satisfying
7023063 i think that game the second one dayer is gone its different conditions different wickets in colombo i expect our batsmen to come good tomorrow
7023064 it is a different wicket and a lot firmer than what it used to be the ball will come to bat and there will be more runs the batsmen hold the key and they have to put runs on the board they are the ones who control the game
7023065 you cant say that their indias batting was fragile you probably have to give a bit more credit for our bowlers and the conditions i think they will come back strongly but we are also prepared
7023066 vaas bowled both the days and batted and has not complained or anything he looks pretty good we will have another look tomorrow as well it is only stiffness right now there is a very good chance that he will play
7023067 hear ye hear ye the court of common sense is now in session the honorable judge andrew s heller presiding
7023068 be seated everyone i see we have the olympics on the docket today bailiff read the charges
7023069 yes sir with the beijing games winding down fans are charging many of the competitions with impersonating real sporting events
7023070 wed like to begin with skeet shooting your honor the people feel skeet shooting is clearly an activity and not a sport in that pulling a trigger requires very little physical ability
7023071 your honor i object skeet shooting requires steady nerves and a sharp eye and has been part of the olympic games since 1896
7023072 counselor has there ever been an injury in skeet shooting a torn ligament a broken nose anything like that
7023073 uh not that im aware of although one of the shooters had a hangnail once
7023074 then its not a sport and will therefore be barred from all future olympics next
7023075 trampoline your honor we feel that while bouncing on a trampoline does indeed require some athletic ability it should be declared an activity and not a sport on grounds that it is primarily a childrens diversion
7023076 when i say marco youre supposed to say polo marco
7023077 no its simply my way of saying i agree that trampolining is kiddie stuff not unlike walking on stilts or playing marco polo it therefore does not belong in the olympics next
7023078 synchronized swimming your honor we feel this is clearly not a sport
7023079 rhythmic gymnastics your honor we feel its a travesty of justice to consider this a sport
7023080 is that the one where the ladies jump around twirling ribbons
7023081 then it is hereby declared an activity and a fairly ridiculous one at that if you can wrap it around a present its not a sport next
7023082 i object your honor while the prosecutor may have had a point with the last two water polo clearly has elements of a true sport there are goals scoring a ball
7023083 and tell me would you watch a water polo match on tv would you take your son to a water polo match so the two of you can bond over the glory of the sport would you buy a cable package specifically to watch water polo or join a fantasy water polo league
7023084 yes your honor we feel its more cheesecake than competition
7023085 objection volleyball is recognized as a sport the world over your honor
7023086 that may be so counselor but im afraid im going to have to rule in favor of the prosecution and declare it an activity albeit an extremely interesting one
7023087 because i am married counselor and my wife says i have to or ill be sleeping on the couch for a month youre married counselor any objections
7023088 sono sicuro di vedere un buon palermo ha detto in esclusiva zamparini a ilpalermocalcio it perch teniamo ad andare avanti anche in questa competizione comunque sar per me una partita senza troppe tensioni perch quelle che conteranno saranno le gare di campionato cosa mi piace di pi del palermo tutto specie il modo con cui fanno gruppo

7023092 the president has made it clear several times until now america was russias advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community
7023093 we included russia in the group of eight g8 leading industrialized nations we welcomed and pushed forward russias desire to join the that is all at risk now
7023094 this is a great post but im clamoring for a follow up post on the need for a 28 hour day what do you say
7023095 this year will be different there will be no more morning rushing around no more late nights replying to emails no more traffic no more sleepless nights
7023096 i obviously had scored i dont know if they werent watching or what
7023097 thats one of the things i hate about this sport
7023098 i hope people will be wowed by the image and think more about the problems posed by climate change
7023099 a felixstowe with no beach huts or promenade would be unthinkable to many of us yet it is a possibility
7023100 the beach and promenade is a great place for social interaction
7023101 some beach huts have already been moved back because of the danger of being washed into the sea
7023102 the installation is designed to make us all think about the consequences of our current patterns of consumption
7023103 i think public art is a great thing and can have a great impact
7023104 people come across it stop and think about what it means art can really straddle social barriers

7023114 in the world that i study everybodys trying to kill the biofilm
7023115 but theres not a concrete answer for that and thats why you need to understand methods
7023116 thats why we can be one of the few labs in the world that can focus on methods development
7023117 every time a person buys a product with an epa approved efficacy claim such as kills 99 percent of bacteria the public trusts the validity of the process used to prove that claim
7023118 our goal is to grow bacteria in a way thats relevant to how the bacteria exist where the product is used
7023119 that way we can have more confidence in the products actual effectiveness and so can the public

7023135 no player will be kept here against their will this does not mean that madrid will not defend the interests of the club
7023136 im sure that robinho has already weighed up the consequences of his decision and im sure that in the next few days he will give a letter to the club to announce that he wants to go if he does not want to be here he should leave as soon as possible
7023137 i can tell you that madrid are not going to transfer robinho we are not going to sell him if he wants to go then he should go now telling the press about it is not the right way to do things
7023138 its not necessarily that he will have to pay the 150 million euros he would end his contract but the courts will decide what he has to pay
7023139 nobody is obliged to stay here but we will defend our interests
7023140 this is what we announced publicly on our webpage he should leave as soon as possible but he must accept the consequences of rescinding his contract when it has two years remaining
7023141 i hear that we wants to go well he will have to give notice in writing
7023142 no because the transfers need to be done at the end of the competition not five days before the start of the season its a lack of respect to the club its history and to the fans we want robinho to stay in madrid
7023143 right now with this situation we cannot do anything to take a decision like that in life you have to abide by the consequences
7023144 its not the moment to say that he wants to leave this is in may but he will have weighed up the consequences
7023145 if he doesnt want to play he wont play but this is his problem im going to defend our interests
7023146 if he says tomorrow that no he doesnt want to go that he was only raising the idea then we can talk madrid respect his decision and nobody can work where they dont want to
7023147 we are not thinking about this possibility at the moment but we are going to weigh it up
7023148 if robinho confirms that we will not continue we will contemplate this possibility but i am not the one who decides that up until now the team have done very well and the work of mijatovic and schuster has been very good

7023177 intinya lembaga penyiaran itu harus berizin termasuk televisi kalau tidak berizin ya akan kita putus tapi kalau tetap melanggar ya akan kita seret ke pengadilan
7023178 karena itu pemerintah sudah mengeluarkan surat edaran kepada seluruh pemilik stasiun televisi kami minta mereka mengurus izin dalam dua bulan ke depan tapi kalau masih belum mengurus izin juga maka mereka akan kami ajukan ke pengadilan

7023270 i have great respect for him great respect for his line
7023271 i continue to say that when a policy is made without consulting the people operating in the sector then there is likely to be a mistake the federal governments intention for giving 13 local manufacturers license to import bagged cement was to put to an end the short supply and ensure the crash of price of the product in the country yet this they have not achieved after six months the price had remained stagnant how would a local manufacturer be asked to bring in bagged cement and he is expected to reduce money this is not done he would fix a favourable price this is pure politics i dont think the idea of bagged cement importation is to reduce cost or to meet short fall in local supply what i think is that this people for their own interest and not the masses keep enriching themselves
7023272 go around and investigate the companies that benefitted in this bagged cement importation are all foreign companies who are using nigerians to front the companies are not indigenous at all i have been in the import business for 25 years so there is nothing about importation that is new to me if the government want to knock down the prices of cement let them come and meet the indigenous importers bring the licence to us i bet you cement would be sold at n600 per bag in this country they all know what they are doing like i said earlier nobody is doing anything for the sake of the masses dont be surprised that the people at the top of this decision of importation of bagged cement into the country had negotiated with their so claimed local manufacturers how much percentage would be theirs if the deal is done for them you see why i keep saying it is politics it is their personal business if they want to challenge this thing that i have just said let the indigenous importers be invited screened and those that are found legible to import cement into the country be given licences then you would see how these so claimed indigenous manufacturers would object to it the earlier we start telling ourselves the truth the better for all of us in this country a bag of cement six months ago was n1800 and after six months the government importation of bagged cement announcement it is still sold at n1 800 so tell me who is fooling who if youre talking about new 6 companies also licensed for the bagged cement importation let me make one thing clear to you both the new companies and the old ones are in a cartel they come together fix a particular price they would want to sell if this must work in this country the government would as well set up a committee that would monitor it i mean if it must be effective anything apart from that the price would still remain as it is
7023273 if the licensed importers are sincere enough the price would have gone atleast abit

7023480 der markt bewegt sich seitw rts dabei gibt es jede menge kreativit t bei den europ ischen entwicklern von handyspielen und viele tolle ideen
7023481 in japan bekommt der entwickler gut 90 prozent in den usa noch rund 70 und in europa gerade noch 50 prozent pro verkauftem spiel
7023482 der handyspielesektor galt lange zeit als ein sehr umsatzkr ftiger markt bisher konnte er sein potenzial aber noch nicht wirklich entfalten
7023483 zun chst einmal k mpft die branche mit dem problem dass es sehr viele unterschiedliche arten von handy games gibt die auf verschiedensten plattformen angeboten werden
7023484 zu diesem vertriebsproblem kommt erschwerend hinzu dass entwickler von handyspielen kein einheitliches interface zur verf gung haben f r das sie spiele entwickeln k nnten
7023485 auf dem kreisstaffeltag am 29 juli haben bis auf die nicht anwesenden vereine alle vertreter eine protestliste gegen die sonntagsspiele um 14 45 uhr unterschrieben diese bergeben wir unserem kreisvorsitzenden hiermit hat herr weischenberg eine klare direktive der vereine uns zu vertreten ich m chte hiermit alle anwesenden kreisvorsitzenden auffordern eine vergleichbare einfache liste aufzusetzen
7023486 w re die eigeninitiative der vereine in westfalen wenn alle kreisvorsitzenden die gleichen vorgaben ihrer vereine bekommen muss der flvw uns auf bundesebene vertreten sollten die kreisvorsitzenden nicht im interesse der vereine handeln sollten die kreise einen au erordentlichen kreistag einberufen dies ist mit dem antrag von mindesten zwei drittel der vereine aus dem entsprechenden kreis m glich sollte der flvw nicht entsprechend unseren vorstellungen handeln k nnen wir bzw die kreisvorsitzenden einen au erordentlichen verbandstag einberufen
7023487 wir haben kein verst ndnis f r den dfb bzw unsere vertreter im verband und kreis die uns in diesem jahr die verbandsabgaben um 100 erh ht haben und durch drohende zuschauerverluste im n chsten jahr noch die einnahmen klauen wollen es ist doch nicht zu bestreiten dass uns zuschauer fehlen werden wenn der bvb schalke oder bochum zu den gleichen zeiten spielen wie wir amateure auch wenn nicht alle nicht ins stadion gehen werden gibt es auch nicht wenige die sich die spiele im fernsehen anschauen werden was passiert mit unseren helfern die eine jahreskarte haben
7023488 wir im dfb nur noch eine randgruppe darstellen mit der man umspringen kann wie man will wer soll unsere spiele denn noch pfeifen wenn auch die schiedsrichter ihr recht in anspruch nehmen und ins stadion gehen
7023489 besonders w tend nicht eine u erung der verantwortlichen zielt darauf ab dass man verst ndnis f r die ngste und n te der amateurvereine aufbringt herr korfmacher behauptet in kommentaren dass es keine probleme mit den amateuren im zusammenhang mit den sonntagsspielen geben wird noch im vorfeld wies herrn korfmacher in einer pressekonferenz zur bezirkskonferenz die kritik an den sonntagsspielen zur ck
7023490 verdienen die bundesligisten nicht schon genug geld mit den bisherigen spielterminen

7023619 and you need to have someone with such experience in your administration its not like theres a cabinet position that deals with foreign policy every single day had there been a cabinet spot whose job description involved meeting with world leaders daily and troubleshooting international crises i certainly would have put biden in that slot but since such a position doesnt exist i had no choice but to make biden my vp
7023620 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7023621 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago

7023625 tener la flota m s moderna y respetuosa con el medio ambiente en europa
7023626 mejorar los barcos e implementar gu as de conductas que est n en la l nea de las nuevas exigencias medioambientales sin comprometer por ello el confort de los pasajeros
7023627 la ceremonia de la puesta a flote de msc splendida confirma el compromiso de incrementar nuestra flota dado que es la cuarta vez que visitamos san nazaire en 2008
7023628 en el transcurso de un a o msc splendida y su hermano gemelo msc fantasia se unir n a la flota estos dos barcos ser n los m s bonitos del mundo adem s de ser los primeros en ofrecer la exclusiva zona vip msc yacht club y el centro aurea spa ambos barcos cumplir n con los m s estrictos requisitos medioambientales implementando un moderno proceso de tratamiento de aguas e incorporando la tecnolog a m s eficiente que en el caso de ambos permite la utilizaci n de la piscina tambi n a lo largo del invierno
7023629 entorno a los 1 000 1 400 euros por pareja se puede visitar las ciudades de tenerife si lo que se busca es playa y a la vez conocer lugares que a veces son desconocidos mientras que lanzarote es m s para quitarse el estr s y disfrutar del sol
7023630 no todo son ofertas los vuelos charter son los que realmente proporcionan alg n tipo de descuento en las tarifas a los viajeros a las empresas les conviene una ocupaci n total de las plazas del avi n o barco aunque sea a precio de coste porque el gasto es el mismo lleve los pasajeros o no y el sueldo va a ser el mismo para los trabajadores
7023631 la agp designar en qu muelles se los atender al resto los recibiremos con nuestro habitual servicio de calidad
7023632 es el mejor lugar porque no est cerca del sector operativo del puerto donde est n los contendores y adem s tiene la mejor visi n de la ciudad y un acceso r pido a la zona m s tur stica
7023633 el problema principal es que los cruceros que llegan para la pr xima temporada tienen 300 metros de eslora y no da el c rculo de maniobra en la punta del antepuerto para que puedan entrar a las d rsenas la soluci n es correr la escollera exterior de piedra lo que significa una inversi n muy grande pero es imprescindible para el puerto m s all de los cruceros
7023634 abrir la boca de entrada al puerto de los 200 metros actuales a 300 adem s record que en la actual terminal de cruceros se ampliar la capacidad de atenci n al pasajero
7023635 se habilitar n ex dep sitos de elma y as a los 7000 metros cuadrados de hoy se sumar n 2900 metros cuadrados
7023636 trp habilitar a dos frentes para cruceros estamos dragando la zona de giro frente a la d rsena c para ocuparla y entre las alternativas que estamos evaluando figuran la cabecera del quinto espig n que no est concesionada ah es donde descargan los buques petroleros as que todo depende de las tratativas con camesa otra posibilidad es la cabecera de terbasa
7023637 los cruceros tienen en la ciudad un impacto directo de 100 millones de d lares si tuvi ramos jurisdicci n sobre el puerto lanzar amos de modo inmediato la construcci n de una nueva terminal de cruceros
7023638 se trata de un negocio previsible que deja mucho dinero no s lo por el paso de los barcos y sus pasajeros sino por el recambio de tripulaciones en los pr ximos a os buenos aires deber competir con otras ciudades para atraer cruceros si bien es cierto que todos pronostican el crecimiento de la demanda eso no significa tener un lugar asegurado nos interesa mantener y aumentar la cantidad de barcos que llegan por eso ofrecimos toda la cooperaci n del gobierno porte o para que a n en condiciones que no son las mejores los visitantes est n bien atendidos
7023639 hay que separar lo urgente de lo importante con recursos limitados y la temporada casi encima es bueno que se est n buscando soluciones seguramente en los pr ximos d as habr una comunicaci n formal de cu les ser n los muelles alternativos
7023640 es muy importante desarrollar una estrategia para posicionar los atractivos de buenos aires para los cruceros para eso es fundamental contar con una terminal dedicada a cruceros de calidad internacional es fundamental trazar una pol tica clara y a largo plazo que mire m s all de la coyuntura porque a nadie le escapa que si se mantiene el ritmo de crecimiento actual las soluciones ideadas para esta temporada ser n insuficientes el a o que viene tenemos que resolver qu haremos en cinco a os
7023641 los ingresos que deja una temporada pueden administrarse de modo que rindan todo el a o
7023642 por su estacionalidad la terminal de cruceros sola no tiene repago
7023643 no es quitarle tierras al puerto porque esa parte no se utiliza
7023644 ver llegar a un crucero de lujo y despu s ver por d nde se bajan los pasajeros entre los contenedores es terrible la gente de la terminal trp que tiene la concesi n de la actual terminal de cruceros hace un trabajo fant stico pero la infraestrctura no es la mejor adem s se est privando a la ciudad del espect culo de los cruceros desde miami a barcelona la llegada y zarpada de un crucero es una verdadera fiesta

7023650 nuclear weapon proliferation is the single most immediate threat hanging over the world today
7023651 turned its hand to new bunker busting nuclear weapons designed to attack underground facilities
7023652 the plain fact is there can be no non proliferation without de proliferation
7023653 that is if the weapons states are not prepared to rid themselves of nuclear weapons why would other states continue to deny themselves the kind of leverage which these weapons bring
7023654 the old order of victorious powers with major powers hanging onto weapons of massive destruction is a remnant of the violent 20th century
7023655 it cannot provide the basis for an equitable and effective system of world governance
7023656 just as world community concerns have been ahead of the political system on issues such as global warming so too world community concern needs to galvanise international action to find a new template for a lasting peace one embracing all the major powers and regions
7023657 this can be done but it requires leadership and imagination
7023658 up to 35 militants have been killed and scores were injured when security forces launched a massive operation against militants in the kabal district of swat valley
7023659 we carried out the suicide attack and other bombings and will continue with more attacks if the government does not halt the military operation against us

7023675 kami menjangkakan akan memperoleh majoriti lebih besar daripada pilihan raya umum lalu sedikit lebih besar daripada majoriti mac lalu
7023676 tetapi perlu diakui bahawa wujud pelbagai taktik kotor dan penipuan sejak beberapa hari lalu ini antara kemungkinan yang boleh menjejaskan majoriti besar yang diharapkan
7023677 kini sokongan kepada saya sudah melepasi 41 peratus walaupun beberapa hari yang lalu ada penurunan sedikit dan saya pasti ia akan meningkat dalam sehari dua ini tidak mustahil untuk memperoleh lebih 50 peratus
7023678 kami tidak bercakap mengenai angka tahap peratusan tetapi campur tolak kemungkinan akan memperoleh majoriti yang baik berbanding 8 mac

7023712 russia is clearly irritated at what it perceives as u s meddling in its neighborhood
7023713 it seems to be sending a message that if you play on our periphery well play in yours
7023714 consistent work to restore traditional relations in all areas of cooperation
7023715 we need to re establish positions on cuba and in other countries
7023716 its impossible to imagine that anyone in the cuban leadership would want to put their country in the bulls eye of another superpower showdown reminiscent of the missile crisis
7023717 the military talk seems to be bluster on moscows part
7023718 cuba has nothing to gain from a military relationship which would be high risk and out of character with the steady renovation of diplomatic relationships
7023719 as ive heard dozens of times over the years from cubans on the island the bolos russians are not to be trusted
7023720 russia seeks to reassert itself as a world power which includes a renewed presence in while cuba wants to diversify its economic partners to reduce its dependence on venezuela

7023724 the failure of the venezuelan government to go after this is a failure to be serious
7023725 frankly this has gotten to the point where theyre playing games
7023726 usually drugs is beyond a lot of other political differences we have a cooperative relationship with
7023727 there just has been no willingness to establish that cooperation or re establish a working relationship
7023728 youve got to go after the criminals and youve got to go after those who are in positions of authority and are criminals

7023734 they have stopped for the olympics but after they have finished we dont know what they will do
7023735 maybe things will go bad again maybe the police will hurt us again we dont know but our future is poor our future is nothing
7023736 in the reluctance of many monks and people to talk about what had happened and in the columns of armed police sporting bulletproof waistcoats and travelling in armoured vehicles who patrolled the streets by night
7023737 there are 400 monk lodging houses here and they came into every one
7023738 if you had a lock on the door they broke it they pointed their guns and shouted freeze and took away our possessions they took 1 000 yuan 80 if you had it or 3 000 yuan pictures of the dalai lama they broke on the floor and they arrested many monks we went to the police but they told us to get out
7023739 they build the roads they build the train to lhasa but they build for the chinese not tibetans
7023740 they send tibetans to school but then there are no jobs except nomad and farmer the jobs go to the chinese this is what i feel when i watch the olympics because on the television the chinese smile for the rest of the world but behind it they do so much bad here that is why i cannot support the team of china china which is cunning like a fox
7023741 theres a good reason that foreigners arent allowed in these places it looks like a war zone in kardze the police are in the middle of the sidewalks theyre sitting in helmets holding their guns and riot shields in rows of 10 or 15 they are outside convenience stores under blue tarps every half a block on both sides of the road watching theyre up on raised metal posts with cutout windows watching i couldnt walk anywhere without dozens of armed police staring at me ive never seen so many police and military personnel in one town in my life nor have i experienced this kind of heart pounding fear before
7023742 the chinese government did not keep the promise it made at the time of winning the olympic bid
7023743 we held high his holiness the dalai lama as the spiritual and temporal leader of tibet and we pray his immediate return to tibet
7023744 long live his holiness the dalai lama and immediate resolution of just cause of tibet
7023745 in one hotel which had no guests at the time about 20 soldiers took over upstairs rooms overlooking the street for the entire period they entered the hotel discreetly so few people knew they were there they were behind curtains or stood back from the window in some other way so as not to be visible from the street they were changed periodically by replacements they paid a small token fee for each room and were well behaved and friendly all were chinese my source believed that an order had been given for that 24 hour period that soldiers could shoot on sight anyone who was seen with a knife or other weapon

7023752 wat mij betreft mag boussoufa weer toeslaan dat precies hij en gillet scoorden zal de gentse fans pijn gedaan hebben maar onder voetballers leeft dat soort dingen tegenwoordig niet zo profvoetballers weten dat ze van werkgever kunnen veranderen
7023753 si robinho no quiere jugar me lo tiene que decir a m y no lo ha hecho

7023755 recib sus declaraciones sin sorpresa simplemente las esperaba mucho antes no hay que dramatizar mucho m s es una parte del juego estoy convencido de que robinho se va a quedar lo que ha ocurrido lo esperaba antes no tan tarde pero lo que pasa es que se acaban los d as y hay prisa
7023756 no me molesta lo que ha pasado en absoluto porque s que no es l no es su decisi n es un negocio que est por encima de la persona s c mo es l y puede estar a gusto aqu como ha estado hasta ahora
7023757 es lo que m s me interesa poder ganar el trofeo y no una discusi n sobre robinho

7023762 when i told denis about the test result we were close to the horses stable and he turned around and walked straight over to lantinus stable door
7023763 there was a wooden tack box hanging over the front of the door with grooming things in it and the horse had his head hanging out over the top of it
7023764 denis put his hand into the box and pulled out a tub of equi block saying that he thought it contained capsaicin now if you knew it was illegal to use it you would hardly leave it sitting in a box at the front of the stable where anyone could see it would you denis was horrified
7023765 ive heard that people have been saying how can we all have been so stupid
7023766 but i would say to that if you were denis lynch and you used that preparation all the time and the horse was tested seven or eight times over the nine months since you had him and each time the test was negative and you never heard of a positive result for this product would it not be reasonable to believe it was fine to use it
7023767 could hyper sensitise them and make them jump better in competition
7023768 i invite you to come up here and try it
7023769 if you were hoping to create a burning sensation with it then you would be looking for your money back

7023785 oh just stay in whatever town sends a fighter our way
7023786 it has been a great learning experience to work with the little girl as i have never acted with a child before unlike adults children are natural actors and they dont care about practicalities of life

7023814 defensively i believe we did a good job stopping the run we improved from a year ago we didnt tackle as well as i would have liked us to we had some penalties but i thought the effort was there we have to tackle much better than we did special teams overall had a good game right now im not really sure about the injuries manuel broke his thumb i know that elvis dumervil dislocated his finger right now with patrick ramsey im not really sure im not really sure on how his shoulder or elbow is right now
7023815 well have to see if he needs to have surgery
7023816 no like i said during the press conference we just want them to play a half we had a lot of plays playing against dallas i felt pretty good about our football team were trying to prevent injuries obviously marquand got hurt in the special teams which was a setback
7023817 im just going to treat it like he sprained his ankle obviously when we have people go down we need to have people step up and take the opportunity wr darrell jackson did not play today because of a sprained ankle hopefully hell be in full speed and ready to go we want to get some of those other players some playing time
7023818 im not going to go into playing time but from looking at the past history its going to be pretty obvious what were going to do
7023819 he had a pretty good surgery they had to get some bodies out of there they said that the results were very positive we just have to see how long it takes
7023820 i really dont know i havent talked to greek head athletic trainer steve antonopulos yet i think ill find out in the next half hour or so
7023821 im very pleased with nate and te tony scheffler has stepped up te daniel graham is obviously out today with a hamstring hell be full speed and ready to go next week like i said we had little bumps and bruises ill find out the status of them in the next hour
7023822 michael played a lot in the second half and did a good job he got tired and we had to put rb andre hall back in hopefully well stay healthy at that position i thought fb peyton hillis did a good job making a big play to give us that first down when we were backed up he made a nice run and nice catch fb cecil sapp and peyton alternated during the first half overall im very pleased im very pleased with the offense thus far
7023823 we started a little slow we still moved the ball and i thought that the line did a great job with the running game they kept us in it we were struggling to complete some balls i was able to get that big one to wr brandon marshall on the first drive to set the field goal we still struggled in the second series we werent able to make big plays our running game kept us in there
7023824 hes good you know hes a big time receiver obviously i just threw it up in the air and gave him a chance
7023825 we had some things going and he understands coverages kind of like i do and we had a good read from each other whenever hes one on one we were able to take some shots and press the cornerbacks up and start jamming them and throw the ball over the top thats what were going to get were going to get some deep balls and some deep comebacks that way hell be hard to stop
7023826 i talked to aaron and i know him pretty well im happy for him hes in a tough spot over there he had a pretty good outing so im happy for him he looked sharp and their offense looked pretty good
7023827 of course were going to miss the guy he makes big play after big play we cant do anything about it we have to do what we can do
7023828 im comfortable with getting back to my wide receiver roots hopefully the coaches will want to get the tight ends involved that way this season
7023829 it was a concept we have been working on a lot against zone defenses wherever they opponents choose they choose wrong and somebody is open i just remember turning around and reaching for it and it ended up being a touchdown
7023830 opportunities dont come along all the time during the games you dont know what will come up and which opportunities youll get to make catches and blocks when opportunities do come along you have to take advantage of them and show what youre made of
7023831 with the team we have and the team we think we can have a 99 yard drive against any team is a big deal
7023832 we know we have the players on this team to go a long way in this league
7023833 i just have to do what i can this is a tough league and its going to take my best to show that i can perform
7023834 the thing about a championship team is you have to have depth when guys go down other players have to step up and fill in
7023835 those guys have a lot of talent they have always had a good team and they came ready to play tonight
7023836 theres a reason they drafted that guy hes a great player and i look forward to seeing him for a long time in this league
7023837 hats off to our offense today and the defense also played well i think coach rich tuten and coach mike shanahan did a great job of keeping us all together in the offense we all worked hard in the offseason and its paying off so far
7023838 we came out and i had a short route the crowd helped out with noise and we audibled to a deeper route and took advantage of them not having a safety over the top the first deep ball i told qb jay cutler to throw it up to me and i didnt catch it we did it again and i caught the ball i feel like im picking up where i left off last year
7023839 i am glad im not the one making the decision they are all great backs and they are all doing a great job rb andre hall and rb selvin young are both making plays and as you saw rb michael pittman scored i am just glad that i dont have to make the decision
7023840 its alright i wanted to go back in for the last drive but i could not grip the ball so i let qb darrell hackney into the game to give it a try ill be fine
7023841 it went pretty well all but one of my kicks went for touchbacks i put through converted my field goals and so far i am happy with what ive done but i want to work on it and get better each week i think no matter what you do your best to keep your job each week no matter if youre a rookie or a veteran
7023842 i am going to a hockey game i cant wait to see who gets the puck in

7023845 real wird nie einen fu baller gegen dessen willen halten wenn der spieler seinen vertrag k ndigen will bleibt dem club nichts brig als dies zu akzeptieren
7023846 f r mich ist bei real ein zyklus zu ende gegangen ich suche eine neue herausforderung
7023847 ich habe ihn noch nie trainiert aber ich mag seinen stil er ist ein spieler der den unterschied ausmacht und solche spieler brauchen wir in unserer mannschaft
7023848 unsere liebe ist nach sechs jahren ehe noch st rker und intensiver geworden
7023849 i think that game the second one dayer is gone its different conditions different wickets in colombo i expect our batsmen to come good tomorrow
7023850 it is a different wicket and a lot firmer than what it used to be the ball will come on to the bat and there will be more runs the batsmen hold the key and they have to put runs on the board they are the ones who control the game
7023851 you cant say that their indias batting was fragile you probably have to give a bit more credit for our bowlers and the conditions i think they will come back strongly but we are also prepared
7023852 vaas bowled both the days and batted and has not complained or anything he looks pretty good we will have another look tomorrow as well it is only stiffness right now there is a very good chance that he will play

7023857 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7023858 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7023859 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7023860 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7023861 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7023862 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7023863 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7023864 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7023865 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7023866 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7023867 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7023868 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7023869 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

7023874 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7023875 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7023876 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7023877 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7023878 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7023879 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7023880 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7023881 who are open to doing something on the production side
7023882 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7023883 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7023884 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7023885 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7023886 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7023887 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7023888 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7023889 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7023890 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7023891 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7023892 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7023893 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7023894 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7023895 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7023896 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7023897 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7023898 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7023899 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7023900 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7023901 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7023902 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7023903 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7023904 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

7023918 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7023919 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7023920 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7023921 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7023922 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7023923 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7023924 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7023925 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7023926 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7023927 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7023928 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7023929 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7023930 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7023931 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7023932 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7023933 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7023934 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7023935 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7023936 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7023937 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7023938 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7023939 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7023940 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7023941 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7023942 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7023943 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7023944 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7023945 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7023946 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7023947 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7023948 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7023949 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7023950 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7023951 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7023952 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7023953 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

7024260 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
7024261 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
7024262 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
7024263 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing
7024264 during the era when bill clinton was president there was a clear re centering of the party
7024265 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country
7024266 enormous dissatisfaction with the republican party has brought out the base more
7024267 the rise of the internet and bloggers have made the party more progressive

7024275 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7024276 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7024277 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7024278 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7024279 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7024280 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7024281 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7024282 without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
7024283 establishing check points and buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7024284 may only be implemented in the immediate proximity of south ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of georgian territory
7024285 inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers from the administrative limit between south ossetia and the rest of georgia in a manner such that no significant urban zone would be included

7024312 i heard about the pigeon pill and i think it s a good idea provided only the pigeons get hold of it
7024313 while we would applaud any pigeon control programme that is non lethal and humane the contraceptive ovocontrol p has a long way to go before it satisfies picas uk that it is wholly non lethal humane and cost effective
7024314 there is absolutely no need to use a pharmaceutical product to reduce pigeon numbers
7024315 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
7024316 we will have to see what other issues were present
7024317 over 30 taliban were killed during the operation and two soldiers also lost their lives
7024318 we have to see what kind of amendments come then only we can decide but we cannot accept prescriptive conditionalities
7024319 there may be changes in the text but we will not allow any changes that will impede the process or block cooperation
7024320 even a minor singaporean official will talk down to someone as senior as me

7024324 we more often get calls from people about physical symptoms like lack of sleep headaches and lack of concentration peoples coping mechanisms are different and we try to help them find healthy ways to cope that can help them through difficult times

7024360 para sa akin po kaliangang pangalagaan natin ang ating kapaligiran dahil ito ang nagbibigay sa atin ng buhay
7024361 kasi inamin din sa akin ni jukka na nang i conceptualize niya ang film festival na ito the moon was rising kaya ganyan ang tawag niya sa okasyon na ito
7024362 three months bago siya mamatay nagpunta siya rito sa mowelfund at nagsalita sa mga tao
7024363 nagparamdam naman siya nang buksan ang fpj hall of national artists nang ibigay ni susan ang suporta ng mga poe sa pagpapagawa nito
7024364 we had some big hits throughout the lineup tonight and were able to get runs across
7024365 they swept us there coming off a loss we really wanted to come out today and obviously win a game
7024366 hopefully we can continue this for the rest of the year
7024367 were going to have to if we are going to overcome the mets were going to have to have games like this throughout the rest of the year
7024368 i just wonder why they call this place the coliseum maybe every time everybody comes here they get ready to be killed
7024369 i talked to him the other day and i told him i really like what i see but you need to play with more tenacity
7024370 he has a tendency to cadillac it a little bit and i just wanted to make sure he got into the right habits joyce is a hustler though dont get me wrong
7024371 you cant help but feel a little homesick every once in a while but i love it here
7024372 the doctors are convinced that this should prolong my career
7024373 for whatever reason my back is really guarding against letting that spasm out
7024374 i talked to charlie about it its something you just shrug your shoulders about and scratch your head sometimes you take hitting for granted you think its going to happen and then when you dont hit everybodys trying so damn hard to pick up the other guy that you get in your own way
7024375 we have to get back to how we used to hit
7024376 he asked me if i had started growing dreadlocks yet
7024377 ive watched it a couple of different times earlier in the year it helps to an extent
7024378 they did it last week in that four game series out there especially on utley and howard
7024379 if i split them they might not be so eager to bring them in on us
7024380 its a good test of who we are were going to see you have to beat good clubs we have to try to win some games to overtake the mets
7024381 i concerti e i luoghi in cui si tengono non vengono scelti da me ma dagli organizzatori in genere comunque sono posti molto belli
7024382 i grandi maestri americani degli anni 20 e 30 da jelly roll morton ad art tatum
7024383 as a team we were more aggressive against him tonight and i think seeing him in san diego last week had a lot to do with it
7024384 seeing him last week you have it in your head how he pitches to you
7024385 he followed the ball better and had a good smooth swing
7024386 i want him to get back to swinging like he did two years ago
7024387 he was just concentrating on hitting it hard and it was going out of the ballpark when he gets back to that thought process hell hit 300 again i want him back to that cut
7024388 ted williams said 90 percent is from the head up and i wouldnt argue with ted williams
7024389 it was nice to get a combination of quality hitting and pitching in one game
7024390 thats what were going to have to do if were going to overtake the mets
7024391 mi spiace perch mio figlio jonas voleva sentire linno ma sono comunque molto contenta ha continuato la idem dico sempre che sono cos forte perch sono molto pigra non faccio nessuno sforzo inutile
7024392 i dont want to come out of this game he said i had to give him the benefit of the doubt its only fair to him for what hes brought to the team
7024393 to ordain something for the common good belongs either to the whole community or to someone taking the place of the community
7024394 the best regime will be realized in that city or state in which one alone commands all the others by reason of his virtue where some subordinate rulers command according to their merit but where nevertheless power belongs to all either because all are eligible as rulers or simply because all are electors now this is the case in a government which consists of a happy combination of royalty inasmuch as there is only one head or aristocracy inasmuch as many collaborate in the work of government according to their virtue and of democracy or popular power inasmuch as the rulers may be chosen from among the people and it belongs to the people to elect their rulers
7024395 in the measure that positive law is in disagreement with the natural law it is no longer a law but a corruption of law
7024396 a rational injunction made in view of the common good and promulgated by the one having charge of the community
7024397 can be regulated with a view to the common good
7024398 is no other than the good of each one of the members of the collectivity
7024399 a lot of guys came to me and said theyve been inspired
7024400 i said to them you have to be relaxed we know were capable of doing it youve got to enjoy what you do yes i guess ive had a little bit of an impact people have gone out there and enjoyed themselves its great for the sport
7024401 i wouldnt say im a phenomenon im just a great athlete
7024402 i try and stay relaxed by messing around and not thinking too much about the race
7024403 i dont allow people to put pressure on me you might not be focused enough when i enjoy myself i stay focused ill still enjoy myself im still young ill still train hard ill try to keep on top for as long as i can
7024404 running is enjoyable you have to enjoy what you do its a job for us athletes its like working to not enjoy it it doesnt make sense i enjoy it i love it sometimes you think about quitting at training because thats hard but it also makes success more great when you work hard for it
7024405 the track is fast i said to asafa powell and my coach glen mills that anybody who wins is going to break the world record
7024406 i dont know how fast i can go im not really worried about that
7024407 im just looking forward to going on and doing better things i hope to improve every year
7024408 ill definitely be going to the london olympics to defend my title
7024409 people said the 200m world record would be pretty hard to get i got it and its going to be hard to improve it
7024410 to minimize dust entering the camera through the lens mount
7024411 degeaba nu arunc mizerii pe jos degeaba protejez natura dac cei din jurul meu o polueaz in mod continuu
7024412 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7024413 i share the disappointment of many hoosiers that my partner in the senate evan bayh was not selected on this occasion but i believe he will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7024414 this is my first time seeing the team play and of course i have to root for the home team
7024415 to be on our team you have to have a good attitude
7024416 this year for the first time we have a league called the 40 and over league
7024417 we are reaching out to the inmates in a way to help them better themselves
7024418 what they do is something incredible and we are happy they chose our institution to talk to the inmates about christ
7024419 we all need a change and we all need to take time to find the lord
7024420 they fall into these situations because they are chasing after things instead of looking to christ for help
7024421 it meant so much that so many people who knew payden came out today
7024422 people who go to this school should be proud they go to zane trace
7024423 these kids dont have to deal with death and then bam
7024424 this goes to show you life is too short dont take life for granted
7024425 right in front of the school felt like the right place to plant the tree i think it helps the family too
7024426 the memorial was beautiful its exactly what he would have wanted he inspired me to always smile and treat others the way they wanted to be treated
7024427 most players didnt perform to their best level because of the heat
7024428 of course it was not the same spectacle as it would have been with an evening kick off today it was very hot and the players felt it
7024429 we came with the plan of winning the gold medal and weve done it
7024430 it was a beautiful experience i enjoyed some moments which were very different to the ones we are used to
7024431 all the components were there to make several explosive devices
7024432 deputies removed sixteen m203 grenade cartridges several assault rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition
7024433 i had a nice little break now im ready to get back to work
7024434 we had a lot of great candidates who applied which is why we opened it up
7024435 hell be able to come in and continue our programs
7024436 the ball is rolling and i have to catch up to the ball being a new principal i think its up to me to establish a level of trust with the staff students and community
7024437 im in a unique situation i want to do the job and i want to do it the right way
7024438 im a real believer sen obama represents something america needs
7024439 i told him if obama picks biden ill vote for him
7024440 otherwise ill not vote im not stupid enough to vote for a republican most of us were for hillary clinton but when obama got it we had to switch gears
7024441 we need someone now who can do something our country is such a mess
7024442 the first criteria is someone who needs to be able and ready to be president if needed
7024443 i think if your experience is on the legislature side i think a governor brings something to the party
7024444 i think people like obama more than six months ago
7024445 i think as the governor has said there is a common thread that holds states like ohio and tennessee together i think we represent the heart of the country we want a president there working for us who understands life is tough in the middle of the country
7024446 i think what really matters is the effort mccains camp puts on obama as someone out of touch
7024447 he understands for a millionaire that 4 gas or 3 65 gas doesnt matter much
7024448 barack obama is in touch with real people i think john mccains comments to continue george bushs policies shows he is out of touch he ought to come to chillicothe and know the economy is not well
7024449 i really want schools to do a better job finding those things and identifying these things
7024450 we need to pay attention to what happens in schools how to resolve conflict without resorting to violence
7024451 we worked really hard to try to bring both sides together i think we could have come together with a compromise
7024452 i consider the unions my friends but that doesnt mean i have to support this specific proposal ive made a decision that is best for ohio
7024453 while we are seeing a drop in travel it is a small improvement over the fourth of july holiday when we saw a drop of 1 3 percent
7024454 this may show that travelers are starting to respond to the recent drop in gasoline prices
7024455 he likes to get along with people he likes to listen to them
7024456 look at his life and there are half a dozen times when he could have failed being abandoned by his father his troubled adolescent years but he seems to weather adversity better than most
7024457 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
7024458 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess

7024483 sab a que nigeria iba a ser un duro rival uno todav a se acuerda de c mo se perdi en atlanta este tambi n ha sido un partido dif cil ya que ellos son un equipo muy bien organizado con jugadores como el 9 obinna y el 14 odemwinge que son muy peligrosos
7024484 hemos jugado bien pero ellos tienen jugadores como riquelme messi o ag ero que son muy dif ciles de sujetar
7024485 el roce internacional afecta bastante esto se nos hace m s dif cil m s duro
7024486 se ca a la gente yo no pude mantener el ritmo me sent a mal estuve enfermo los ltimos d as con una especie de bronquitis pero luch hasta el final y logr terminar
7024487 fue muy dura en mi caso pagu caro la salida que se hizo bastante r pida pero estoy contento porque di todo el esfuerzo y un poco m s de mi parte
7024488 fue un ritmo muy duro despu s fui cayendo considero que se hizo una buena participaci n frente a gigantes como es el campe n mundial y ganador
7024489 sab a que era la primera y ltima vez que pod a jugar esta competici n es lo que vinimos a buscar y ganar la medalla de oro significa todo
7024490 nos llevamos muy bien estuvimos much simo tiempo juntos por momentos de hac a muy largo muy dif cil pero muchas veces vale la pena hacer un esfuerzo tan grande
7024491 fue muy duro por el calor por el horario pero sab amos que no se nos pod a escapar este partido y por suerte as fue
7024492 no nos ten amos que desesperar sab amos que ten amos que estar muy atentos atr s que en alguna ocasi n pod amos liquidar el partido y as fue les agarramos al contragolpe y di mar a decidi el partido fue un golazo se lo merece porque hizo un gran campeonato
7024493 el que hiciera un gol se pod a llevar el partido como as fue yo era uno de los mayores aqu y hoy me ve a con m s responsabilidad pero ahora me doy cuenta que la medalla de oro lo colma todo
7024494 agradezco a la gente del liverpool que me dejara venir ya tengo dos medallas de oro ahora debo regresar a mi club y seguir trabajando porque el f tbol no para nunca
7024495 estoy contento de la actuaci n ten a el objetivo de acabar era una competencia bastante dura y termin satisfecho
7024496 pas una crisis en mitad de la carrera bastante dura se me pas por la cabeza bajarme llevaba unos dolores de espalda que no pod a ni pedalear pero le puse ganas y ritmo y pude entrar en todas las vueltas
7024497 seguro que en argentina se van a vender millones de bicicletas de pista tras ese xito adem s ellos son buena gente y tienen carisma conviv con ellos en la villa ol mpica y seguro que lo van a saber transmitir muy bien
7024498 argentina estar festejando el oro y eso no me lo paga nadie
7024499 entonces era mucho m s joven ahora soy m s mayor por eso le doy mucha m s importancia es la primera y nica vez que voy a estar en unos juegos ol mpicos as que me siento muy feliz
7024500 ten amos la ilusi n de ganar la medalla de oro y lo conseguimos estoy contento disfrutando mucho

7024503 no ha sido el d a ven a a luchar por la medalla de oro y no he estado a un gran nivel sobre todo en la salida eso ha sido crucial me han cerrado y he perdido unas cuantas plazas el esfuerzo para recuperarlas ha sido clave
7024504 esto demuestra que para luchar en unos juegos hay que estar desde el principio adelante
7024505 pero he aguantado un poco pensando en los valores de los juegos la lucha el sacrificio aguantar el tipo el juego limpio lo m s importante son las medallas pero me he mantenido por los valores ol mpicos
7024506 todo ese tiempo que fui solo sin rebufo pasa factura a la larga se ha visto en la cuarta y quinta etapa me he ido para atr s como un sapo
7024507 en el deporte hay que trabajarse las quinielas marga y yo ramos unas de las opciones y nos hemos sacrificado al m ximo llegar n medallas en un futuro
7024508 no es algo que se gana todos los d as
7024509 junto al mundial sub20 este es el t tulo m s importante de mi carrera y siempre con la selecci n que para m siempre es lo mas importante
7024510 hac a mucho calor argentina aguant bien y supo manejar el partido fue complicado pero gracias a dios di mar a salv el oro
7024511 a pesar de mi condici n hice una excelente carrera estuve taponado en la salida pero lo super tuve momentos de crisis pens en retirarme en los ltimos d as tengo algo de bronquitis pero pude recuperarme

7024516 china ha presentado todos los documentos que demuestran la edad de las gimnastas y que han sido aptas para competir tanto que la propia federaci n internacional les dio luz verde para hacerlo
7024517 la gran perdedora de esta competici n ha sido eeuu

7024520 lo que toca es analizar c mo hemos competido analizar las posibilidades que tenemos de mejora observar una vez m s cu les son los puntos d biles y los fuertes
7024521 sensaci n de trabajo bien hecho de recompensa por una buena actuaci n
7024522 la sensaci n de confianza que te da el hecho de que hemos establecido una l nea de trabajo que sirve
7024523 un estiramiento brusco en el partido de cuartos despu s de esperar se ha confirmado una rotura fibrilar del adductor largo de la pierna derecha y del m sculo gracilis lesi n que le impide competir y que necesita dos o tres semanas de recuperaci n
7024524 algo que en un primer momento le dej abatido pero ahora se ha dado cuenta de que puede ayudar al equipo desde el banquillo con otros detalles
7024525 hay que darle tiempo al tiempo todav a no s lo que har pero al europeo de polonia igual voy como comentarista de televisi n

7024531 este k2 lo empezamos a montar en octubre o noviembre y la verdad si ese mes me dicen que voy a quedar campe n ol mpico no me lo creo porque bamos las primeras veces muy torcidos bastante descompenetrados pero poco a poco ech ndole muchas horas mucho entrenamiento cada vez iba mejor y somos dos personas muy parecidas a la hora de palear somos muy explosivos muy velocistas y tenemos la misma t ctica m s o menos somos gente que salimos muy r pido y nos hemos compenetrado muy bien
7024532 sa l es muy explosivo como yo en k1 en 500 metros somos los mejores venimos demostr ndolo durante mucho tiempo y decidieron montarnos en k2 a ver que tal bamos y la verdad es que dio sus frutos
7024533 hoy fue una regata m s r pida que en el europeo y eso nos benefici fuimos todo el tiempo all alante y en los ltimos 100 metros supimos aguantar muy bien el tipo fue lo que trabajamos estos meses y creo que dio su recompensa

7024609 no building like it a modern steel reinforced high rise had ever collapsed because of an uncontrolled fire because of those doubts engineers hold open the possibility that the collapse had other explanations like damage caused by falling debris or another source of heat a combination of an uncontrolled fire and the structural damage might have been able to bring the building down some engineers said but that would not explain steel members in the debris pile that appear to have been partly evaporated in extraordinarily high temperatures dr barnett said

7024622 i believe that emmanuel has been unfairly treated because he had a lot of interest from many big clubs and he always told me one to one his preference was to stay in the end he stayed
7024623 that story did not come out like that in the press and unfortunately he is paying a price for a story which is not really him
7024624 he made a press conference in austria where people interpreted his statements a bit differently but i know what he told me and i know he made sacrifices to stay
7024625 i was convinced he wanted to stay but i was not always convinced he would stay because there is a big difference in that
7024626 there is lots of speculation but anton is part of my plans he is in here trying to get fit
7024627 matthew upson and calum davenport are playing at the moment tompkins and collins are still out daniel gabbidon has been since november
7024628 the nearest one to go back in is anton and that is where we are at at the moment
7024629 i spoke to him in the summer and we will see how it develops but as far as i am concerned he is in here every day trying to get fit
7024630 my players are being linked with other clubs and it shows we have got some decent players

7024649 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7024650 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president

7024652 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7024653 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

7024667 i used to play that game every day and thats why i became a hockey fan thats how i got to know hockey and i fell in love with it back then
7024668 i really wanted the hockey show job and when i got it i was like uh oh what am i going to do because not only was i scared of the players i was scared of the fans because theyre so intense
7024669 so i bought the book hockey for dummies i bought the smart girls guide to sports to help me prepare but talking to the guys and being around the game really helps you get to know what hockeys all about
7024670 and thats what the hockey show is about its the other side of the nhl we pay a lot of respect to the sport because it deserves that but we also give hockey fans a front row seat to the entertainment side of hockey
7024671 hockey certainly already crosses over into the world of celebrities
7024672 weve got the mike comrie hilary duff relationship going on the rachael hunter jarret stoll relationship on the show i do for people magazine online we actually featured hilary duff and mike one time and i hope to do more of that because there really is more to hockey than just the score
7024673 hockey is the only sport that makes me yell at the tv without even realizing im doing it
7024674 ill yell for whoevers doing good or whoevers doing really bad i think i lost my voice during the stanley cup playoffs last year
7024675 ill do the hockey show and when i get home ill get online and log on to facebook or myspace and really get into serious hockey talk with fans

7024910 the difference between him last year and this year is his ability not turn those things into big innings and thats why hes been able to run up his record
7024911 ten wins is quite a departure from last year the stuffs the same he still has a tendency to walk folks but his composure is a lot better than it was last year i think that was the difference
7024912 quentin is probably one of the better hitters in the league this year and jermaine dye is a good hitter too ive got a lot of respect for both of those guys but thats my job to come in and face guys like that and im happy to get the job done tonight
7024913 i just want to get back in the swing of things where i feel comfortable
7024914 its not a big deal when i get through a game and do something well i just want to contribute to whats going on its awesome
7024915 you cant be surprised that a team like that gets you the first game of the series but theres two more games theres nothing over yet
7024916 the first six years have been a good base for my career being able to learn about myself and pitchers
7024917 as long as youre physically healthy and strong hitters get better with age no doubt
7024918 i learned so much from chipper jones in the year i was with him us both being switch hitters and very selective hitters
7024919 our lockers were next to each other and we talked every day
7024920 he had the most unbelievable three months ive ever seen
7024921 hes one of the most focused players on the field ive ever seen i was very lucky to play with him for a year
7024922 ive gotten better every year early in my career i was more of a free swinger and my walks to strikeouts were a bit of a concern
7024923 after the 2005 season my third season with the rangers teams started getting more careful with the way they pitched me i started taking more pitches and walking more
7024924 some pitchers are going to come after you and if youre too selective you can find yourself in bad counts after you face a guy three or four times you get a feel for his approach
7024925 moving back and forth between leagues my book on pitchers has gotten a lot bigger
7024926 so where can i really see xahs writings that demonstrate its quality with respect to conventional english standard
7024927 the discontinuous groups of rotation and translation in the plane
7024928 so where can i really see xahs writings that demonstrate its quality with respect to conventional english standard
7024929 the discontinuous groups of rotation and translation in the plane
7024930 hes coming to training camp and hes going to try to prove that he can make the team
7024931 he has come in for a couple of workouts hell try to make the team somehow
7024932 is great company line your eggs are safe in our basket type of pitches including a quick talk from martin buhr from amazon he took the usual route of explaining how great amazon was at scaling out very quickly demonstrating how some projects scaled up to 1000 of instances in some cases
7024933 one of the things that the world needs to know is that when people commit fraud the little people are the victims

7024938 god is a comedian playing to an audience too afraid to laugh
7024939 if you want the best things to happen in corporate life you have to find ways to be hospitable to the unusual person you dont get innovation as a democratic process you almost get it as an anti democratic process certainly you get it as an anthitetical process so you have to have an environment where the body of people are really amenable to change and can deal with the conflicts that arise out of change an innovation
7024940 just as everything seems to be coming together fine i notice simons voice is getting a tad croaky he looks great but its been a while since we were last onstage together and one gig isnt enough to get the voice back in shape i can tell he is straining to hit the high notes and theres still that note to come as the song reaches crescendo with a view yoo ow to a kill he screeches all bloody live
7024941 we are shocked by the behaviour of the police and local authorities whodid not allow any peaceful protest to happen
7024942 says lenka kukurova representative of european youth foraction eyfa the network that supports the ecotopia gatherings
7024943 we do not believe in ourselves until someone reveals that deep inside us is valuable worth listening to worthy of our trust sacred to our touch once we believe in ourselves we can risk curiosity wonder spontaneous delight or any experience that reveals the human spirit

7024950 it was one of those things that happen in bike racing
7024951 you can be upright one minute the next minute youre on the floor i just had an unfortunate first 300 metres
7024952 i was trying to battle to the front but unfortunately 40 other guys were trying to do the same thing
7024953 i just touched wheels and went off the course into a bit of a gully
7024954 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7024955 if a player is out for a certain period there is no point rushing it
7024956 you may as well wait the extra week or two to make sure they dont suffer any setbacks
7024957 sometimes the age of a player helps with their recovery
7024958 transfers have to be organised at the end of the season not five days before the start of the season this shows a lack of respect towards the club its history and the fans
7024959 also the offer we have received shows how little chelsea value the player
7024960 real are not going to sell robinho it is another matter if he wants to leave well then he should go but it is not the right way to do it by telling the media
7024961 he should put it in writing to us to resolve his contract and the matter will be closed we dont keep anyone against their will at this club slavery was abolished a long time ago
7024962 if tomorrow he says he doesnt want to go that he was only floating the idea then we can sit and talk about his future in spain
7024963 im really happy i tried really hard and i knew i was going to be ready for the bronze medal fight
7024964 i had three injections in her ankle it was really sore and i struggled physically i was ready more than i have ever been but mentally i was tired
7024965 the ups and downs are something to remember its my third time at the olympics and im happy with a medal
7024966 degree of nagles impairment coupled with his mental capacity education training and age placed him in the odd lot category
7024967 finally it must never be forgotten especially in an age of upheaval and disillusionment that american democracy rests squarely on the assumption of a pious honest self disciplined moral people whatever doubts may exist about the sources of this democracy there can be none about the chief source of the morality that gives it life and substance from puritanism from the way of life that exalted individual responsibility came those homely rules of everyday conduct or if we must those rationalizations of worldly success that have molded the american mind into its unique shape the men of 1776 believed that the good state would rise on the rock of private and public morality that morality was in the case of most men and all states the product of religion and that the earthly mission of religion was to set men free
7024968 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection

7024972 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share

7024974 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7024975 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7024976 he had advice for how he deals with struggles and the mental side
7024977 they werent going after bad pitches and were hitting strikes this is a good lineup
7024978 i couldnt keep the ball in the park you have to keep the ball in the ballpark no matter where you pitch when you give up five runs on two swings its hard to win like that
7024979 it was a two seamer that ran down and away and i just went with it and was able to get good wood on it
7024980 i knew what was going on i was falling behind in counts and not being aggressive
7024981 tonight i came out attacked the strike zone and got ahead
7024982 here lately his fastball has been up more and out of the strike zone but the good pitches that he made the ball sunk and he kept it low

7025000 whether i stay in charge is up to the bosses of british cycling theyve got to step up and think what they want to do ive got a family to feed a living to make and i want to win things im not paid that much to be honest and if someone came along and asked me to do something else for a lot of money who knows
7025001 like a pop group the sum of its parts are greater than the individuals when i get asked to and work in other places for other people id be a fool to think i could just walk off on my own ive got a brilliant team of people we blend well together itd be a dangerous thing to think i can go and do this somewhere else now
7025002 were smart enough to have learned any lessons performance wise we wont miss anything but i dont want to rush into anything ill speak with
7025003 why not people said it was impossible to finish third here go back six months and think about people saying you cant finish better than fourth in the medal table which was plausible if you looked at the stats you couldnt finish third because you couldnt dislodge russia
7025004 but thats the simplicity of what we are trying to do conventional wisdom would have dictated we couldnt finish third but it is possible so rather than saying weve set ourselves up to fail in london this could be the best step forward

7025114 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
7025115 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
7025116 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
7025117 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
7025118 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
7025119 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
7025120 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
7025121 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
7025122 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
7025123 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
7025124 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
7025125 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
7025126 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
7025127 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
7025128 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
7025129 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
7025130 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
7025131 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
7025132 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
7025133 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
7025134 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
7025135 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
7025136 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
7025137 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
7025138 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
7025139 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
7025140 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
7025141 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
7025142 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
7025143 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
7025144 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
7025145 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

7025158 i think the china government has done a very good job of presenting a positive image overseas but in doing so it didnt change much of its behavior to do that
7025159 this was part of the grand plan to show a new china and i think its delivered in many regards
7025160 china is trying to present itself as nonthreatening and in a lot of ways nonsocialist
7025161 theyve gone all out to try and present a country thats ancient yet super modern

7025170 any coach put in that situation was going to have a hard time but he came in positive saying look guys i dont want to change everything im just going to tell you what i know what ive been through and were going to change a few little things thats exactly what we needed
7025171 at the time i was like oh my god what are we doing but maybe theres a method to this madness
7025172 we realized its all of us together were going to come out and win and lose as a team thats what it took
7025173 i knew we had the talent but i didnt know how far we could go
7025174 i think the china government has done a very good job of presenting a positive image overseas but in doing so it didnt change much of its behavior to do that

7025179 i am impressed by the cosmopolitan atmosphere i didnt think it would be so urban and so advanced
7025180 last time in athens we only had a very slow start and we won the olympic title in athens purely out of good luck
7025181 this time it has been a really tough race because our opponents are stronger than last time
7025182 before the race i knew my son would come here
7025183 in that way his arrival here would boast my confidence
7025184 we are frightfully disappointed and we never want to feel like this again
7025185 its been eight years at the top it wasnt going to last forever
7025186 how can you not be happy with an olympic silver but not getting gold does hurt
7025187 it is normal actually for him not to come back
7025188 i wont change that and i dont see any problem with it because people enjoy watching me ill stay the way i my personality
7025189 it is an unfortunate comment at this time especially when we are driving young people to become more involved
7025190 we have to see it in the glory of their moment and give it to them
7025191 we have to allow the personality of youth to express itself
7025192 he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made
7025193 i talked to the other guys and most of them are ok with it
7025194 not this time he was fantastic we are very privileged to have this
7025195 transfers have to be organised at the end of the season not five days before the start of the season this shows a lack of respect towards the club its history and the fans
7025196 also the offer we have received shows how little chelsea value the player
7025197 real are not going to sell robinho it is another matter if he wants to leave well then he should go but it is not the right way to do it by telling the media
7025198 he should put it in writing to us to resolve his contract and the matter will be closed we dont keep anyone against their will at this club slavery was abolished a long time ago
7025199 if tomorrow he says he doesnt want to go that he was only floating the idea then we can sit and talk about his future in spain
7025200 but all the pressures on them i think theyre the ones who are scared
7025201 we were talented before we had beaten everybody at different times but he made us believe we could get it done in the biggest tournaments
7025202 terry came in at a hard time with our team
7025203 any coach put in that situation was going to have a hard time but he came in positive saying look guys i dont want to change everything im just going to tell you what i know what ive been through and were going to change a few little things thats exactly what we needed

7025217 taken the discussion out of that box that america tends to put people in and given some additional light on us as a people
7025218 i dont think it was his intention but it is what it is and he cant lessen that
7025219 obama will give our kids an image someone they can look at on television who looks like them
7025220 he gives our youth someone to look at and say look where you are
7025221 it is healthy for these discussions to go on it is also healthy that the rest of america is interested in those conversations if we stay within our communities our challenges wont be overcome
7025222 i didnt have the luxury i suppose the certainty of the tribe i hadnt grown up in compton or watts i had nothing to escape from except my own inner doubts
7025223 in their mannerisms their speech their mixed up hearts i kept recognizing pieces of myself
7025224 and thats exactly what scared me their confusion made me question my own racial credentials all over again
7025225 isnt a black american it exposes people to the fact that being black is a lot more than people assume the fact that the first black nominee for president is barack obama shows being black can be many different things
7025226 i have definitely heard parents and friends who are rwandan tell me you dont want to associate with african americans
7025227 and i am friends with african americans who will say look at those africans
7025228 my brother and sister are from kenya they have lived here for 30 years and are american citizens
7025229 they feel more comfortable hanging out with white people than african americans they feel african americans are angry all the time i have an african american friend and everything she talks about is race
7025230 but can we become so fragmented that we dont share anything
7025231 things that people view as important or their general way of thinking
7025232 obama hasnt sacrificed his blackness to get to the presidency
7025233 blue tie dark suit trying to lose the weight and i am not the only one
7025234 playing the role of the nonthreatening black works for me i went to boarding school and kenyon college and i have a masters degree
7025235 part of me has my fist clenched under the table
7025236 there is this feeling that black confrontational behavior wont be so acceptable we have to all play the game now
7025237 coming home from school and finding out the lights have been cut off
7025238 man up a plan for the spiritual and organizational retooling of black america
7025239 hasnt told us what hell do to create jobs in the inner city and create economic development
7025240 he is getting a pass as the black candidate when he really hasnt dealt with black issues his lineage hasnt been in the suffering in the struggle
7025241 you should see the emails i get from my girlfriends
7025242 we all want someone who lifts us up and praises us obama is raising the bar for black men
7025243 the fact that he didnt says a lot its important for my boys to see a love relationship that doesnt depend on skin types they see they dont have to be with a light skinned black woman to be successful
7025244 i wouldnt give a damn about him if it wasnt for michelle
7025245 he has enough fortitude and courage to let michelle be michelle
7025246 a lot of black men misunderstand that barack and michelle they both hold their own
7025247 a lot of my women friends are saying i want that in my life
7025248 barack and his wife are going to change a lot of views of black males
7025249 the males are going to look at barack and they will come back to the home they will be our role models

7025252 at the v luna there is no medication for tuberculosis patients they are supposed to get it every day for six months but they dont how can they get better
7025253 i am concerned about the human rights the government wants to demolish our homes in our community when somebody has done wrong he is just gunned down
7025254 in the search for truth we thought it may be good to come up with a more innovative and creative way of telling the people about it thats why we came up with this idea
7025255 we will band together to honor truth and to make the philippines the most truthful place on earth through the arts one street at a time
7025256 the point was to reveal what the people really feel this is a joyful gathering there is no confrontation
7025257 the turnout was better than we expected the people are still interested in the truth we have here sectors from schools the church the urban poor
7025258 that is another truth cover up they abduct our loved ones when they speak the truth and my son was speaking for farmers
7025259 of all the lies that are told to us are there still those who question it who fight it we should not let it happen

7025279 the siege that the israelis have imposed on gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law it is also immoral global institutions and the governments of the world know what is happening and are not doing anything about it
7025280 if israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships we will not forcibly resist
7025281 is this the way israel observes its responsibilities under the oslo accords under the accords and the gaza jericho agreement
7025282 its not only an action movie it goes beyond that we have the humanity just so close to the chaos its frightening its talking about clones its talking about global warming its about terrorism its about the danger of science and i know im very afraid about the danger of science sometimes its great and sometimes it goes too far and its dangerous its about religion so its about all of that with the science fiction its not really science fiction to me its anticipation

7025303 that the charges began to be implemented in october the same month ridley thomas announced his candidacy for county supervisor
7025304 mark has for more than a decade been one of long term care workers greatest allies
7025305 mr parks call certainly sounds like another effort to silence the voice of working people
7025306 are not willing to subject nurses again to the outrageous anti union campaign
7025307 theres been a history of that behavior by the employer
7025308 our nurses felt that the cna did not deliver on their promises and it was time for them to go
7025309 lack of transparency poor employment practices environmental impacts and other indicators of irresponsible corporate behavior
7025310 no private equity firm that we want to do business with will do business with us under these terms
7025311 cost taxpayers and beneficiaries millions in higher taxes and contributions
7025312 destroy our ability to invest in our highest returning asset class
7025313 the biggest worries schools have are hackers getting into the web site
7025314 obviously being interested in computers i asked the student what he was working on the kid replied that he was hacking into the finance office computer so he could mark his tuition account as paid
7025315 its a nightmare the new web 2 0 apps are giving students more ways to get in
7025316 part of the challenge is that the kids in one school will take down the networks of other schools its like having a snow day to them schools have become so dependent on technology to run the office and deliver instruction in the classroom taking down the networks is equivalent to removing the cash registers from wal marts without the technology people cant function
7025317 these include the introduction of malware the need for effective gateway controls and bandwidth consumption we are seeing a significant increase in web 2 0 coming into the schools these new uses are straining all hardware with bottlenecks the peaks in demand raise concerns that school networks cannot handle the traffic schools have to re evaluate their networks
7025318 all of this we didnt traditionally let them do because of security and bandwidth concerns
7025319 weve had to relax our posture to let them all have access this presents us with an interesting challenge i cant say no anymore
7025320 at this point the sense we get from school it administrators is they are constantly fighting bandwidth
7025321 the growing issue is what should it managers do with smartphone and related devices
7025322 when these devices are used it doesnt know it is happening it presents new issues to us these devices can be lost and other users have more readily available access the smartphone has become a us 79 laptop
7025323 we need to push teachers to use educationally sound web sites rather than blogging sites
7025324 it is very difficult to separate the good from the bad on these popular general use web sites
7025325 teachers dont realize that ultimately the school district is responsible for any abuses that occur teachers have to share that responsibility for what their students access in school
7025326 schools have to be current with their use of security technology one of the biggest mistakes it people at schools make is putting all their security on the perimeter over the last few years we are seeing spikes inside the networks now it has to harden the network data center even from its own users

7025375 j t osullvan will be our starter going into the season he has good command of our offense hes played well in all three preseason games and now its time to get ready for the season
7025376 we knew coming in that we may never have this experience again so we are lucky that everything went well and we got what we wanted
7025377 i think he has played very well in the olympic tournament
7025378 hes played very well today as he normally does in his position and i knew that he could probably be the deciding factor
7025379 i think it the game had been played in another part of the day it would have been very different
7025380 we tried to make sure that we didnt get uptight just to play our own game
7025381 we wanted to play with intelligence and move the ball around and not run around so much we wanted the ball to do the work
7025382 estoy plenamente consciente que esta situaci n se presenta para intentar desequilibrarme y yo no lo voy a permitir as que me pregunto dignamente dios qu aprendo en esta situaci n
7025383 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7025384 i think i am much better positioned to win kentucky mo arkansas west virginia than any of the other candidates running because of my positions on the issues because i come from a state that is a border state that the politics of having to reach across party lines matter because my 34 years in the senate have been the opposite of polarizing they have been uniting so i think for all those reasons i think i have the best chance of crossing over and picking up independent votes and keeping a democratic base but again time will tell that thats an assertion its a judgment that democrats are going to make but they will make that judgment of who they think well be best able to win a general election
7025385 you know hes a very smart guy but i know for me that it was a learning experience i worked very hard im sure hes working very hard too ive watched seven presidents and ive watched presidents who have come to office who havent thought through some of the areas that theyve never worked in for example foreign policy i watched several presidents come in and theyre smart as the devil and they get here and unless you already know when you get here exactly what your foreign policy is its awful hard to hit the ground running and not to make serious mistakes the first couple of years im not saying that senator obama is where i was when elected to the senate at age 29 i was younger than he was when he got to the senate but i do think i acknowledge that experience is not the issue its whether your experience has been good or bad somebody with 34 years of bad experience isnt perfectly qualified to be president someone with 34 years of good experience that makes a big difference so again i know its kind of difficult to master its kind of difficult to feel sure footed in a lot of areas that you havent spent a long of time dealing with
7025386 its a little bit like my friend dennis kucinich dennis god love him gets up in all these debates and says the democratic congress could end the war today dennis should read the constitution you gotta have 67 votes to override a presidential veto unless hes figured out how to get 17 republicans in the senate to vote with us im not quite sure how to do that but its very appealing
7025387 the third thing thats different since his 1988 presidential run are the obscene amounts of money that are being it is radically different the last time i changed this at the stage i left which was eight months before iowa i had raised 6 million and that was more than any other candidate had raised in the democratic process now youre talking about these giant amounts of money that its arguable that you need 100 million to run in a primary its obscene i think theres going to be a backlash to it

7025506 no one attacks each other here mr romanov likes this club believe me
7025507 this is not a collapse just look at the positives
7025508 sometimes at our age we think we know everything and we dont know anything thats the truth
7025509 i cannot remember any player who has left arsenal and been a superstar you know it is difficult dont get me wrong alex hleb and mathieu flamini are probably two of my best friends in football i wish them all the best i speak to them every week
7025510 arsenal is arsenal and this club has something special that no others have we have to take care of it thats why you have to be intelligent in your decisions
7025511 i know what this clubs has i have spoken to a lot of players i have friends in spain in italy and they speak to me about other clubs and i know that im privileged to be where i am and i dont want to lose it
7025512 im still young i want to win things for the club i want to get experience and i want to compete because when you see football around the world you see very few teams that play the way that we play and i just enjoy the way we play
7025513 what can i say hes my friend but apart from that hes a professional hes a great passer of the ball he works hard defensively hes scoring goals now for me it would be perfect
7025514 he has experience he has won the champions league he has got to another champions league final hes a european champion and hes only 26
7025515 of course right now we are competitive but maybe in the middle we need somebody who can make some competition who can add another dimension i think thats all we need really all the rest is fine
7025516 with the champions league we should not be afraid of anyone
7025517 we have seen in the last few season we have seen we can beat anybody so we have to be positive that this time we can make it to the final
7025518 i have been to a few finals now to understand what happens you can play well and lose and play not well and win i think we have the quality and the experience to do it

7025525 obamas decision to choose him is an exceptionally good choice that shows that obama is trying to unite all democrats behind him
7025526 bidens nomination is obamas attempt to balance his small foreign policy experience when compared to republican presidential candidate john mccain
7025527 this can lead to tension within obamas campaign which has been promoting a change away from the establishment
7025528 should obama win the election there will be a different foreign policy thanks to biden than the one under a republican mccain

7025540 our goal is that by june 2009 the sons of iraq are out of business
7025541 well aware of the sacrifices the sons of iraq have made that they were a critical element in bringing the security situation under control and that it is in their strategic advantage to assimilate them peacefully and orderly into iraqi society
7025542 the ones sois in baghdad and diyala province just changed their t shirts there are large numbers who were really al qaeda we have to really look hard for those elements without blood on their hands

7025546 i could read from ratan tatas statement that he is troubled in west bengal so i invited him to come here instead and we will give him a red carpet welcome there are a lot of probable sites for the nana project in maharashtra we have a mega project policy in maharashtra and whatever concessions there are in that policy will be given to the tatas if they decided to come here
7025547 we will offer a market price to the farmers and give proper compensation for their land all problems related to land acquisition for industry have become synonymous with the state of west bengal
7025548 orissa is willing to consider the nano project if tata approaches us
7025549 tata has already acquired a lot of land at bhopalpur in orissa this could be the probable site for nano if tata agrees
7025550 i will soon write an offer letter to tata group to formally invite them to install its nano plant in punjab for which every possible facility will be provided by the state government
7025551 the state would make one of the best available offers to the tatas once the offer is discussed in a threadbare manner every issue would be sorted out

7025610 he said he raised some points with the government and hoped to return in terms of concrete outcomes there was not much
7025611 so far as i heard she is not satisfied with the present condition during this visit of mr gambari
7025612 the president has made it clear several times until now america was russias advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community
7025613 we included russia in the group of eight g8 leading industrialized nations we welcomed and pushed forward russias desire to join the world trade organization that is all at risk now
7025614 in this crisis situation we cant start taking options off the table the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are
7025615 russia is clearly irritated at what it perceives as u s meddling in its neighborhood
7025616 it seems to be sending a message that if you play on our periphery well play in yours
7025617 consistent work to restore traditional relations in all areas of cooperation
7025618 we need to re establish positions on cuba and in other countries
7025619 its impossible to imagine that anyone in the cuban leadership would want to put their country in the bulls eye of another superpower showdown reminiscent of the missile crisis
7025620 the military talk seems to be bluster on moscows part
7025621 cuba has nothing to gain from a military relationship which would be high risk and out of character with the steady renovation of diplomatic relationships
7025622 as ive heard dozens of times over the years from cubans on the island the bolos russians are not to be trusted
7025623 russia seeks to reassert itself as a world power which includes a renewed presence in latin america while cuba wants to diversify its economic partners to reduce its dependence on venezuela

7025634 i think the china government has done a very good job of presenting a positive image overseas but in doing so it didnt change much of its behavior to do that
7025635 this was part of the grand plan to show a new china and i think its delivered in many regards
7025636 china is trying to present itself as nonthreatening and in a lot of ways nonsocialist

7025659 there are issues that have now just come to light because of the investigation these conditions are not new conditions
7025660 it may well be they werent doing their due diligence
7025661 all they would do is come in and maybe look in one or two rooms and thats it
7025662 they have to have some place to stay and we are trying to police it as much as possible
7025663 id rather have them in a facility knowing they are taken care of than under a bridge or homeless
7025664 at any given time things can look very good and then the next time not look as good
7025665 it does not take long when you have no professional staff directing your staff for care to deteriorate

7025674 it is a very relaxed place where rules are not followed
7025675 if you add a lot of mental health residents that adds to the burden
7025676 do we even need city inspectors if there are state inspectors
7025677 a lot of them dont even have family members or if they do they have family members that wont have anything to do with them

7025728 locally produced food and drink are also sought more and more by people wishing to see a reduction in food miles this trade exhibition addresses all of those issues and it could enable more firms in the county to share their experience to help make devon even greener
7025729 the president has made it clear several times until now america was russias advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community

7025776 the bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals and 362 admonishments to heterosexuals that doesnt mean that god doesnt love heterosexuals its just that they need more supervision

7025787 the owner of the wallet is responsible for protecting himself from the armed robber
7025788 what is really needed in my perspective is a full blown inquiry on what is happening to the food inspection business in this country
7025789 inspecting the products before they make it to the stores before people can actually purchase them those are the audits that arent being made those are the audits that arent being made because theyre too short staffed
7025790 dedicated to the preservation increase and dissemination of knowledge of horns whistles sirens bells and other acoustic devices used in signalling and warning applications
7025791 but id look at beau and hunter asleep and wonder what new terrors their own dreams held and wonder who would explain to my sons my being gone too
7025792 and i knew i had no choice but to fight to stay alive
7025793 history will judge him harshly not for the mistakes he made we all make mistakes but for the opportunities he squandered
7025794 when i stopped trying to explain to everybody and thought it through the blame fell totally on me
7025795 there would be another time if i really wanted it
7025796 the most prepared to be president of the united states
7025797 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than senator biden
7025798 hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
7025799 we are glad someone is pushing back at bush im certain he will have a hand at finding a solution
7025800 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7025801 if my biggest test is am i too loquacious versus whether im qualified or competent id take that test
7025802 this is not a judgment of what a group of elite though very well informed reporters think its what people think in their living rooms in iowa what do they think in california the public is going to make a judgment
7025803 one of the reasons were in trouble is the last eight to 12 years both political parties have concluded youve got to be able to get your whole platform down to a bumper sticker
7025804 but things are much more complicated and serious than that im going to treat the american people with respect im going to give them my rationale im not going to assume they cant understand it
7025805 we talked to joe and we looked at him as though god had sent us a gift
7025806 si mi vuoi rispondere o s ne sei davvero convinta
7025807 riecco lirritazione mi rifiutavo di essere io la prima a romperlo e resistevo con tutte le forze
7025808 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7025809 dr oz recognizes that the spiritual is connected with the medical i love him because he likes to combine eastern and western medicine like acupuncture and massage
7025810 he has a true passion for the human body and has helped me understand things about the way it works
7025811 i do it because of how it makes me feel
7025812 same with surgery when families thank me im respectful but i dont feel comfortable not better or worse when people say nice job after a show thats not why i do it
7025813 i began to see why healing required more than my 11 blade
7025814 not just how to keep them alive but what kept them going
7025815 we were so used to treating the disease that we had forgotten to treat the patient
7025816 what oprah taught me more than anything else is that as a physician i shouldnt get tied down to the content
7025817 i should get tied down to the emotions underlying the motivation thats where the battle has to be waged
7025818 its not just about understanding the words but it has to resonate
7025819 so that people sit back at home and say thats right ive got to do that she taught me a lot about that
7025820 nunca he entrenado a robinho pero me gusta porque su estilo es diferente intenta regatear muchas veces es un futbolista diferente y necesitamos un jugador que pueda marcar diferencias dentro del campo

7025828 fixed election dates stop leaders from trying to manipulate the calendar and they level the playing field for all parties
7025829 the only way we can have justice is to have a fixed election date because an election without a fixed election date is a tremendous advantage for the party in power
7025830 you should be consuming bullys comics content on the regular

7025861 rayman you and my kids were friends the second they were born to be honest with you i thought you be relaxed and excited with all this today

7025873 give me more than half of your gt gt gt honestly earned money or you will be arrested
7025874 i think the china government has done a very good job of presenting a positive image overseas but in doing so it didnt change much of its behavior to do that
7025875 this was part of the grand plan to show a new china and i think its delivered in many regards
7025876 china is trying to present itself as nonthreatening and in a lot of ways nonsocialist
7025877 theyve gone all out to try and present a country thats ancient yet super modern
7025878 wants people to shift their responses beyond the man standing in front of the tank
7025879 i am impressed by the cosmopolitan atmosphere i didnt think it would be so urban and so advanced
7025880 i thought some of the work my classmates did on the project was better
7025881 i really didnt think i would win because theres like so many good pieces
7025882 i made it with different colored paper cut with an x acto knife
7025883 i was really surprised i won because the other pieces were great too
7025884 i was calling anyone and everyone who would listen to me
7025885 we just felt that despite the hassle to be there and the expense to be there that this is a really important point in history
7025886 the pirates fired from these boats as they tried to board the ship
7025887 russia is clearly irritated at what it perceives as u s meddling in its neighborhood
7025888 it seems to be sending a message that if you play on our periphery well play in yours
7025889 consistent work to restore traditional relations in all areas of cooperation
7025890 we need to re establish positions on cuba and in other countries
7025891 its impossible to imagine that anyone in the cuban leadership would want to put their country in the bulls eye of another superpower showdown reminiscent of the missile crisis
7025892 the military talk seems to be bluster on moscows part
7025893 cuba has nothing to gain from a military relationship which would be high risk and out of character with the steady renovation of diplomatic relationships
7025894 as ive heard dozens of times over the years from cubans on the island the bolos russians are not to be trusted
7025895 russia seeks to reassert itself as a world power which includes a renewed presence in while cuba wants to diversify its economic partners to reduce its dependence on venezuela

7025898 he doesnt own the houses cindy does hes a maverick hes a war hero
7025899 mccain was a pow in the hanoi hilton you know
7025900 the republicans think they are the ones who own this line of attack they are the ones who were pushing this sort of nonsense about a guy from a broken home who worked his way up from food stamps to a comfortable life never in a million years thinking that the democrats would in fact fight back but he is and they are shocked angry and most of all scared their entire campaign is on the rails with one comment from mccain exposing how very vulnerable they are on the battlefield they prepped
7025901 giuro che appena ne avr il potere li ridurr in mutande
7025902 beh sai com lui non pu farci nulla ma tu
7025903 we cant keep them from reading their bibles and knowing the truth
7025904 we cant even keep them from forming an intimate relationship with their saviour
7025905 once they gain that connection with jesus our power over them is broken
7025906 so let them go to their churches let them have their covered dish dinners but steal their time so they dont have time to develop a relationship with jesus christ
7025907 distract them from gaining hold of their saviour and maintaining that vital connection throughout their day
7025908 keep them busy in the non essentials of life and invent innumerable schemes to occupy their minds
7025909 tempt them to spend spend spend and borrow borrow borrow
7025910 persuade the wives to go to work for long hours and the husbands to work 6 7 days each week 10 12 hours a day so they can afford their empty lifestyles
7025911 as their families fragment soon their homes will offer no escape from the pressures of work
7025912 over stimulate their minds so that they cannot hear that still small voice
7025913 entice them to play the radio or cassette player whenever they drive
7025914 this will jam their minds and break that union with christ
7025915 pound their minds with the news 24 hours a day
7025916 flood their mailboxes with junk mail mail order catalogues sweepstakes and every kind of newsletter and promotional offering free products services and false hopes
7025917 keep skinny beautiful models on the magazines and tv so their husbands will believe that outward beauty is whats important and theyll become dissatisfied with their wives
7025918 keep the wives too tired to love their husbands at night
7025919 if they dont give their husbands the love they need they will begin to look elsewhere
7025920 give them santa claus to distract them from teaching their children the real meaning of christmas
7025921 give them an easter bunny so they wont talk about his resurrection and power over sin and death
7025922 keep them too busy to go out in nature and reflect on gods creation
7025923 send them to amusement parks sporting events plays concerts and movies instead
7025924 and when they meet for spiritual fellowship involve them in gossip and small talk so that they leave with troubled consciences
7025925 crowd their lives with so many good causes they have no time to seek power from jesus
7025926 soon they will be working in their own strength sacrificing their health and family for the good of the cause
7025927 nuclear weapon proliferation is the single most immediate threat hanging over the world today mr keating said
7025928 turned its hand to new bunker busting nuclear weapons designed to attack underground facilities
7025929 the plain fact is there can be no non proliferation without de proliferation
7025930 that is if the weapons states are not prepared to rid themselves of nuclear weapons why would other states continue to deny themselves the kind of leverage which these weapons bring
7025931 the old order of victorious powers with major powers hanging onto weapons of massive destruction is a remnant of the violent 20th century mr keating said
7025932 it cannot provide the basis for an equitable and effective system of world governance
7025933 just as world community concerns have been ahead of the political system on issues such as global warming so too world community concern needs to galvanise international action to find a new template for a lasting peace one embracing all the major powers and regions
7025934 this can be done but it requires leadership and imagination
7025935 we have been negotiating for several months no one has signed anything as yet but we are hopeful the talks will reach a conclusion
7025936 i just knew at the time i was signing that it wasnt the right decision and something i wasnt 100 per cent sure that i wanted to do at the time i thought it was what i had to do but with hindsight it was not what i wanted
7025937 four or five months previously i really let the contract situation get to me and i just made the wrong decision
7025938 i didnt handle the pressure of the contract running out and negotiations either not happening or not going very well
7025939 the closer it got to the end of the contract i didnt enjoy that i think my agent at the time did his job he tried his best to get me the best deal at celtic but unfortunately the two sides couldnt get together
7025940 i think i should have made a different decision if i did it again i would have taken a more hands on role with negotiations
7025941 the manager had shown enough faith in me to be a player and thats something i hadnt really had before
7025942 i think the manager knew when i spoke to him that i was sorry for the way it had ended i had a feeling of letting him down as well as some of the staff and obviously the club
7025943 i think he knows i would have liked it different from the way it actually happened now ill try as hard as anyone to get into his team
7025944 vergis je niet kom nooit zonder toestemming van de vader of de rechter terug met je kinderen realiseer je dat je volkomen afhankelijk bent van de goodwill van je ex partner als je niet zelf in het andere land een goede advocaat kunt betalen en je ex partner wel realiseer je dat de nederlandse rechter als eerste je kinderen terug zal sturen omgeacht de gevolgen voor de kinderen
7025945 dei a aula para meus filhos mas se outros encontraram valor nela isso maravilhoso

7025948 estou morrendo de vontade de me divertir e vou continuar me divertindo todos os dias que tiver at o fim porque n o h outra maneira de fazer as coisas
7025949 a little toooo ironic and yeah i really do think its like rainnn on your wedding day

7025956 last week the national party announced a policy of increasing administration for those who are sick
7025957 from now on people receiving new zealand superannuation veterans pension invalids benefit or disability allowance will just receive a letter checking that the details work and income holds are correct
7025958 if the information is correct the person doesnt have to do anything previously they would have to fill in a form every year reconfirming all their details
7025959 this relieves clients and case managers from excessive paperwork and allows them more time to have meaningful discussions about what support a person may need
7025960 it is this kind of policy treating people based on their individual circumstances and focusing support on those who are ready to plot a realistic path back into work that has led to plummeting benefit numbers record unemployment and falling child poverty
7025961 the national party need to face up to the fact that attacking the weak is not the most effective way to make the social welfare system work for new zealand
7025962 wasnt satisfied that the parade breached the legal threshold of offensiveness

7025971 let one of the conference outcomes be a major international push back against misguided criminal laws and prosecutions
7025972 there is no public health rationale for invoking criminal law sanctions against those who unintentionally transmit h i v or expose others to it
7025973 criminalization is warranted only where someone sets out knowing he has h i v to infect another and succeeds

7025976 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
7025977 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7025978 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
7025979 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs hardball echoing comments he made earlier in the day at an event promoting his book at the national press club
7025980 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
7025981 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7025982 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7025983 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack
7025984 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7025985 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
7025986 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
7025987 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act

7025991 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

7025993 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7025994 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7025995 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7025996 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7025997 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7025998 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

7026000 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7026001 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7026002 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7026003 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7026004 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7026005 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7026006 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7026007 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7026008 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7026009 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7026010 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7026011 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7026015 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7026016 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7026017 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7026018 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7026019 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7026020 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7026021 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7026022 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7026023 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7026024 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7026025 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7026026 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
7026027 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
7026028 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7026029 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7026030 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7026031 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7026032 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
7026033 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7026034 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7026035 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7026036 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7026037 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7026038 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7026039 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7026040 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7026041 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7026042 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7026043 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7026044 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

7026046 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7026047 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7026048 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7026049 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7026050 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7026051 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7026052 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7026053 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7026054 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7026055 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7026056 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7026057 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7026058 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7026059 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7026060 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7026061 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7026062 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7026063 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7026064 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7026065 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7026066 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7026067 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7026068 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7026069 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7026070 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7026071 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7026072 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7026073 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
7026074 and i said let them set a fair mitre upon his head so they set a fair mitre upon his head and clothed him with garments and the angel of the lord stood by and the angel of the lord protested unto joshua saying thus saith the lord of hosts if thou wilt walk in my ways and if thou wilt keep my charge then thou shalt also judge my house and shalt also keep my courts and i will give thee places to walk among these that stand by hear now o joshua the high priest thou and thy fellows that sit before thee for they are men wondered at for behold i will bring forth my servant the branch for behold the stone that i have laid before joshua upon one stone shall be seven eyes behold i will engrave the graving thereof saith the lord of hosts and i will remove the iniquity of that land in one day in that day saith the lord of hosts shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree

7026076 for the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of god and if it begins with us first what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel
7026077 if we would judge ourselves we would not be judged
7026078 the stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner this is the lords doing it is marvellous in our eyes
7026079 sanctify the lord of hosts himself and let him be your fear and let him be your dread and he shall be for a sanctuary but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of israel for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of jerusalem and many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken and be snared and be taken
7026080 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i lay in zion for a foundation a stone a tried stone a precious corner stone a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make haste
7026081 then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth
7026082 forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it brake in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure
7026083 i will remove the iniquity of that land in one day

7026113 im happy for ronaldo to be well paid as he deserves it but i deserve my money also
7026114 his situation is totally different to mine it was a difficult situation at levante and i wouldnt wish that on any footballer
7026115 it was very tough how did i pay my bills luckily i have been playing football for a while so i had to use my savings
7026116 we used to joke about it but it was very hard because some guys couldnt get to training the other players had to pick them up
7026117 the captains of real madrid and barcelona raul and xavi have promised us they will not start the league until the situation is resolved
7026118 it still isnt resolved so the first games in spain are in major doubt
7026119 john terry has been captain of chelsea for quite a while that must have been an advantage
7026120 the difference here is that i operate my captains on seniority
7026121 in the long term rio will be captain of manchester united there is no question about that it is a position we are very comfortable with that
7026122 his leadership qualities have improved tremendously over the last couple of years and his ability is there for all to see
7026123 i dont think anyone was actually nailed on for it
7026124 it was always a flip of the coin between rio or john terry
7026125 at rios age i dont think we need to worry about the effect of what happened
7026126 but it was the managers choice and he has chosen john terry rio just has to get on with it it is as simple as that
7026127 unselfishness is maybe not the biggest crime to have as a football
7026128 it shows qualities of teamwork and a general nature which is terrific to see in footballers
7026129 we are in an era of individual appreciation earrings tattoos goals the need to be seen
7026130 it is refreshing someone is prepared to sacrifice that for the team effort
7026131 you really have to check out the photo wow with the hail
7026132 i have confronted death and defied it several times in the past
7026133 he was in a good mood very relaxed with no official duties he was completely different
7026134 only russian prime minister vladimir putin knows when they are leaving
7026135 het klopte allemaal hoe weet zon man dat maar wat hij schrijft zouden we zonder meer accepteren dat valt onder het hoofdstuk eerlijk commentaar
7026136 what we are facing is a numbers shortage there is no way we will be able to survive at our current level if it continues like this
7026137 it will be impossible to have any improvement this season if we do not improve the numbers greatly
7026138 we cannot sustain what we did last season finishing fifth and having a good european run we could not really sustain it when we were short of players from january onwards last season
7026139 now we are more players short than then so if we are in a worse position there is no way we can achieve again what we did last season we are trying to make it better and working hard on the current situation
7026140 this is probably the toughest period i have had as everton manager mainly because a lot of my concentration at the moment is not with the players i have here and they are the most important but with trying to bring new players in
7026141 there is no doubt that a lot of our energy is being spent on players we want to sign and that is not helpful for the team
7026142 we have come close to making signings but i believe it shows how much you need big money in this division to attract players
7026143 you need to do it at the right time and the shutters in the shop are halfway down at the moment with just a week to go
7026144 the business has changed there are a lot of people these days with their finger in the pie it makes things difficult but that is there way things are going these days
7026145 i am still looking for seven or eight new players at the moment
7026146 we want to play much better than last week that was just not good enough blackburn were better than us i cannot argue about that i am now looking for a better performance
7026147 cahill is at least a month away he has been missed an important member of the team
7026148 but we did not have him for long spells last season and still finished fifth so this is not a one man band here but we need him desperately because of the lack of numbers in the squad as much as anything else
7026149 it is difficult to manage with such small numbers but we had that problem last season towards the end
7026150 the positive side is that we have brought in a lot of young players and they have been terrific they have grabbed the opportunity and i am very pleased with them
7026151 in terms of adding to the squad there is nothing even close we have no one coming in who can help us at west brom so we have to concentrate on what we have
7026152 we have given some kids their chance they are learning and i am learning about them all the time but you get given a group of players and your job as a coach is to make them win i couldnt make that happen last week but we will continue working
7026153 i was not that surprised by what happened last week if people thought it was going to be all singing and dancing with the size of squad we have then they are mistaken
7026154 west brom will be difficult i admire what tony mowbray has done there but not surprised his hibs teams always played good football and that is now how albion play
7026155 you do not really want to play a newly promoted team on their first home game but we will have to make it difficult for them and be aware of what to expect
7026156 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7026157 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7026158 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7026159 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7026160 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7026161 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7026162 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7026163 is not scheduled to be in the recording studio with britney
7026164 misschien gaat het hier gewoon om een toevallig voorbijlopende kat maar de kans dat we echt te maken hebben met de assen van de franse heldin worden nu toch geringer vertelde charlier aan de britse krant the sun

7026166 kegiatan sekarang saya ini selain menulis ya jalan jalan mengunjungi lokasi sejumlah situs bersejarah
7026167 dalam satu tahun saya dijatah dua tiga cerkak begitu juga di majalah lain
7026168 isi buku sudah siap tapi belum ada sponsor yang menerbitkannya
7026169 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it
7026170 peace initiatives and tibetan cultural preservation projects important to the dalai lama
7026171 it seems like suspending itunes is punishment for itunes but really it doesnt hurt itunes it hurts us
7026172 oh my amp amp amp god 40 olympians downloaded a pro tibet album
7026173 i dont know why i went ahead with it i didnt love shafiq and i didnt really want him i was just stupid and naive
7026174 shafiq was in scotland on a six month visa but had over stayed for three years last june he was stopped for driving without a license following which the authorities discovered that he was staying illegally i first met him at his uncles house in glasgow and we were together for a few weeks but he was seeing someone else and we broke up before he was taken to dungavel he phoned me from there last july and proposed i was drunk and agreed to go to pakistan and marry him his uncle farooq arranged everything
7026175 and if no one is listening then it is because they dont want to hear because this is a referendum people dont need anyone to represent them they are representing themselves as somebody who has followed peoples movements and who has been in rallies and at the heart or the edge of things i dont think you can dispute what you see here
7026176 since the 1930s there have been debates and disputes about who has the right to represent the kashmiri people whether it was hari singh or sheikh abdullah or someone else and the debate continues till today whether it is the hurriyat or some other party
7026177 we found more than 20 tombs built of mud bricks in this area and inside these tombs we found sarcophagi intact for the first time completely enclosed in mud brick
7026178 when i opened this mud brick up i found the oldest mummy inside
7026179 the mummy has been dated as being some 5 000 years old and this mummy was covered completely with linen when we found it
7026180 in the last few years weve had to revise our views on how long mummification has been going on
7026181 some bodies were found at a site called hierakonpolis in the southern part of the nile valley they show signs of mummification with resin and linen and they go back to around 3400 bc
7026182 this latest find is obviously a very early example of mummification any new information like this is bound to add to our knowledge of what is quite an unclear picture at the moment
7026183 i only drive one way there will be no points racing
7026184 little crank on his first feature win and just a sign of more to come good run jason frankel tough luck with the tire but willtake a second place finish and good luck this weekend

7026187 hungarian weightlifting silver medalist ferenc gyurkovics and puerto rican wrestler mabel fonseca were expelled from the games today after testing positive for steroids the international olympic committee said
7026188 kita mengalu alukan penyertaan golongan ini kerana bidang penternakan mempunyai potensi luas untuk memperoleh pendapatan lumayan sekali gus meningkatkan industri asas tani negara
7026189 kita juga berhasrat melahirkan usahawan muda dan berasa golongan siswazah paling layak untuk diketengahkan dalam program ini
7026190 we gave him time to be what he can be
7026191 its a big step for him but its a big step for a lot of them its a very contentious race
7026192 itll either make him run better or worse one or the other maybe hell run real big sometimes that happens and thats why were running him
7026193 we were disappointed he didnt win the jim dandy but it was a good effort
7026194 when we lead him over were going to lead him over with confidence
7026195 nuclear weapon proliferation is the single most immediate threat hanging over the world today mr keating said
7026196 turned its hand to new bunker busting nuclear weapons designed to attack underground facilities
7026197 the plain fact is there can be no non proliferation without de proliferation
7026198 that is if the weapons states are not prepared to rid themselves of nuclear weapons why would other states continue to deny themselves the kind of leverage which these weapons bring
7026199 the old order of victorious powers with major powers hanging onto weapons of massive destruction is a remnant of the violent 20th century mr keating said
7026200 it cannot provide the basis for an equitable and effective system of world governance
7026201 just as world community concerns have been ahead of the political system on issues such as global warming so too world community concern needs to galvanise international action to find a new template for a lasting peace one embracing all the major powers and regions
7026202 this can be done but it requires leadership and imagination
7026203 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7026204 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7026205 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7026206 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7026207 can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7026208 for all his self confidence the 47 year old illinois senator obama worried that he couldnt beat republican john mccain without help from a seasoned politician willing to attack
7026209 as he biden speaks as he goes on and on and spins his long statements hypotheticals and free associations as he demonstrates yet again that he is incapable of staying on the river of a thought and is constantly lured down tributaries from which he can never quite work his way back you can see him batting the little paddles of his mind against the weeds trying desperately to return to the river but not remembering where it is or where it was going i love him hes human like a garrulous uncle after a drink
7026210 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7026211 ya tuhan kami tiadalah engkau menciptakan ini dengan sia sia maha suci engkau maka peliharalah kami dari siksa neraka
7026212 datanglah kamu keduanya menurut perintah ku dengan suka hati atau terpaksa
7026213 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
7026214 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7026215 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
7026216 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7026217 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7026218 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7026219 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7026220 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
7026221 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
7026222 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7026223 sen obama said he would do everything possible to end the war in iraq and emphasized the need for a political solution yet he failed to show up to vote for sen bidens critical amendment to provide a political solution in iraq
7026224 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
7026225 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
7026226 well the point is it turned out they didnt but everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them he catalogued they catalogued them this was not some some cheney you know pipe dream this was in fact catalogued
7026227 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
7026228 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
7026229 the threat saddam hussein presented was that if saddam was left unfettered which i said during that period for the next five years with sanctions lifted and billions of dollars into his coffers then i believed he had the ability to acquire a tactical nuclear weapon not by building it by purchasing it
7026230 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7026231 i mean the truth of the matter is that that the americas this administrations policy and the surge are a failure and that the surge which was supposed to stop sectarian violence and long enough to give political reconciliation theres been no political reconciliation the reality is that although there has been some mild progress on the security front there is in fact no no real security in baghdad and or in anbar province where i was dealing with the most serious problem sectarian violence sectarian violence is as strong and as solid and as serious a problem as it was before the surge started
7026232 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
7026233 if he surges another 20 30 or whatever number hes going to into baghdad itll be a tragic mistake in my view but as a practical matter theres no way to say mr
7026234 unless we fundamentally change the rotation dates and fundamentally change how many members of the national guard were calling up itll be virtually impossible to maintain 150 000 folks this year
7026235 install updates and automatically restart any damn fool time you please
7026236 it becomes a win win situation for the children and family members of these offenders when they are able to maintain employment and provide monetary support to the family

7026239 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
7026240 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
7026241 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
7026242 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
7026243 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
7026244 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
7026245 to me its a scathing indictment of the bush administration their total incompetence and mismanagement and disdain for government and running government
7026246 apparently they are so asleep at the wheel that theyre letting people go for months without any consequences
7026247 its about going out there and showing what we can do and cheering for our team hoping we can win
7026248 i know weve lost a lot of players but we also gained a few good ones so im really excited
7026249 i like getting to hang out with all of my friends and eating the popcorn and hot dogs
7026250 i hope we can go far this year as well
7026251 that keeps everybody in a peppy mood its really great when we win but when we lose everybody is there to back the football team up
7026252 football season is a time for us to support our school and support the athletes and also to show what weve done this summer and what we want to do with our season
7026253 the parking lot is going to be about 70 feet from my back door and i dont want it there
7026254 its a beautiful building we just want you to put it somewhere else
7026255 under state code were required to have all on site water stay there or be discharged into a storm sewer
7026256 with modern medicine folks are living longer and we see a real need for this in this area
7026257 i can see the positives in this i wish there were this many people concerned about the blighted properties in this neighborhood
7026258 there was a lot more traffic here when it was a school
7026259 we can figure out ways to work around these things
7026260 were excited and thinking we may keep that for next year
7026261 one of the major issues was the parking lot and its done
7026262 it began the week of the fair as far as tearing it down theyll start hauling away debris on monday
7026263 they tore the gym off first and then went straight across the front
7026264 to have him here at the start of the school year to set that up and running that will certainly be beneficial
7026265 it was exciting to be here through all of the construction its exciting and a new challenge
7026266 secretary paulson has the lead on the administrations policies related to fannie mae and freddie mac working with their regulator
7026267 weve warned the government that wed target police if the army did not stop operations against us
7026268 it would have been cost prohibitive for me to install on my own
7026269 this year most companies wont deliver a large quantity of fertilizer unless farmers have a secondary containment structure
7026270 our office is responsible for making sure practices are planned according to federal and state specifications
7026271 by doing so we were able to bring back a 374 percent return on county and city funding
7026272 we consider low soil loss about 5 tons per acre per year
7026273 the garbers have cut that down to about 4 tons because of their no till practices and contour strips
7026274 these improvements have helped us manage and are saving us money
7026275 a couple of years ago we had a really wet fall and did not get one grape from this farm
7026276 the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
7026277 our track is more practical day to day life and politics just screws it up
7026278 i didnt like bushs 2004 opponent john kerry i dont know it was overall everything i couldnt be precise
7026279 ill probably vote for mccain this year i like the military background the experience
7026280 i was a clinton supporter i would have voted for hillary or john edwards
7026281 you know when youre driving down the road and you see a turtle on a fence post
7026282 well you know that turtle didnt get up there by himself someones got to have put him up there and if theres one thing you know its sooner or later that turtles going to fall
7026283 what im feeling is people are starting to lean toward obama that those who may have had some prejudices may have put those aside for the good of the country
7026284 appalachians are one of the groups of people who will vote for principle and not the pocketbook
7026285 patriotism is never far from the top of the list among my people sacrifice for country duty honor that sort of stuff is huge
7026286 i just think it should be over its dragging out too long
7026287 they reject the notion that one party has a corner on all the good ideas
7026288 all he needs to do is talk about the times hes worked with democrats he needs to talk about the times hes disagreed with the president and he needs to point out that barack obama was rated most liberal of the delegation
7026289 we went up in a cable car and a toboggan down so that was really good fun
7026290 sometimes you see all these people walking around and its like oh my god i just walked past an olympic gold medalist
7026291 everything i imagined the olympics to be imagine that times 10 and thats how it feels to be in the olympics
7026292 to me it is very intimidating to do it this way
7026293 it could easily be construed they are trying to get no answers at all it certainly doesnt make me very comfortable the truth is being ascertained
7026294 well ask them about the checks that were conducted and whether or not they asked for them approved of them things of that nature
7026295 to me it would be a lot less invasive and create a lot less anxiety if they received a written response first
7026296 this just raises more questions about the processes and procedures
7026297 in this business if publishers dont collaborate dont maximize efficiencies dont keep the very best people possible or dont minimize costs without affecting the quality of the publication their publication is going to be a foot note
7026298 proximity publishing systems introduces smart work solutions that allow publishers editors art directors and marketers to collaborate anywhere
7026299 this technology replaces proximity with increased efficiency and flexibility while decreasing costs and improving product quality
7026300 the second one is the end of all military actions the commander in chief of the russian federation has taken a decision to that effect and all military activities have been stopped
7026301 only peacekeeping actions are still being executed by a special contingent
7026302 have not heeded his calls for contributions to contested races threatening advertising on behalf of gop candidates
7026303 it has become clear that my call has gone largely unanswered i have no control over the timing or content of independent ads but i have had no choice but to decrease the total budget for our independent expenditures unit
7026304 she was never vetted she was not asked for a single piece of paper she and senator obama have never had a single conversation about it how would he know if shed take it
7026305 the united states has agreed to remove combat troops from iraqi cities by next june and from the rest of the country by the end of 2011 if conditions in iraq remain relatively stable
7026306 the united states has agreed to remove combat troops from iraqi cities by next june by the end of 2011 if conditions in iraq remain relatively stable
7026307 approved by prime minister nuri kamal al maliki and other iraqi leaders before it goes before iraqs fractious parliament
7026308 in restive diyala province united states and iraqi military officials say there were orders to arrest hundreds of members
7026309 as part of large security operations by the iraqi military
7026310 places of worship should stay out of social and political matters up from 30 percent four years ago
7026311 its not every day a stranger says how you doin darlin
7026312 she was drunk and she said how about a dollar
7026313 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
7026314 we will have to see what other issues were present

7026322 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
7026323 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
7026324 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
7026325 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
7026326 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
7026327 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
7026328 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
7026329 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
7026330 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
7026331 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
7026332 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
7026333 the church of course recognizes and accepts that some among its very large membership may view the issue differently
7026334 introducc on al an lisis hist rico de la ciudad de
7026335 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7026336 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

7026338 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7026339 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7026340 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7026341 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7026342 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7026343 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7026344 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7026345 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7026346 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7026347 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7026348 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7026349 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7026350 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7026351 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7026352 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7026353 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7026354 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7026355 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7026356 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7026357 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7026358 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7026359 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7026360 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7026361 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7026362 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7026363 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7026364 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7026365 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7026366 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7026367 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7026368 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7026369 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7026370 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7026371 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7026372 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7026373 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7026374 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7026375 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7026376 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7026377 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7026378 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7026379 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7026380 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7026381 you dont think you just go because if you dont if you lose its four years of regrets
7026382 while its easy to assume otherwise bootys levels dont feel like tools of destruction b sides rather theyre just more of a good thing and they even look slightly better thanks to some lighting trickery and less repetitive textures regrettably the narrative doesnt feel quite so advanced considering it picks up right where future leaves off with clank having been taken by the time controlling zoni booty tromps off with its own side story ending on the same cliffhanger with little more resolved you have to admire the ambition of doing anything in so little time developer insomniac even managed to squeeze in a heartfelt moment between ratchet and ladyfriend talwyn but a little evolution in the series first overarching plot point wouldve been nice finished quest for booty in about two and a half hours add a little more if youre somebody who doesnt play videogames for a living but take it right back if youre any sort of ratchet fan just to be very clear i dont care about the price ill pay 15 for a few hours of ratchet every time but what shouldve been a love letter to fans ends up serving better as a taste of what outsiders are missing and as a fan that makes me just a little bit sad

7026389 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7026390 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7026391 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7026392 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7026393 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7026394 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7026395 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7026396 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7026397 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7026398 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7026399 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7026400 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7026401 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7026402 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7026403 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7026404 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7026405 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

7026409 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7026410 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7026411 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7026412 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7026413 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7026414 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7026415 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7026416 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7026417 things arent great between them its hard because hes filming in new mexico and shes in los angeles the relationship is strained and their wedding wont happen anytime soon

7026473 lo que se est ofreciendo es un producto absolutamente natural que no compite ni tiene que compararse con el agua de grifo
7026474 en la huelga de transporte de junio lo primero que se agot en los supermercados fueron las botellas de agua
7026475 con el agua est pasando como ocurri con el vino hay mucho inter s por conocer aguas con caracter sticas muy singulares

7026477 queremos concienciar al ciudadano de la importancia de un consumo responsable es una soluci n m s econ mica m s respetuosa con el medio ambiente
7026478 el consumidor debe tener en cuenta el impacto ambiental de una botella pero en muchas ciudades el sabor del agua de grifo es muy malo
7026479 hay que invertir m s en los sistemas de abastecimiento
7026480 hemos denunciado casos en los que se juega con la idea de que el agua embotellada ayuda a adelgazar o que tienen propiedades como la hidrataci n que son comunes a cualquier tipo de agua mineral o no

7026484 i know bruce hit a home run thursday in chicago but he has been struggling a little bit and im going to take a little of it pressure off him for a while
7026485 votto is swinging good three hits thursday including a home run and thats surprising because he didnt pick up a bat for a week
7026486 i love the 3 spot but we had other guys here ken griffey jr batting third so i said i didnt like it
7026487 it is what it is i just love hitting first second third fourth wherever the manager puts me
7026488 no 3 is a beautiful spot for me because i like being in situations to be the guy i feel like i can be that guy
7026489 we worked on some things this week mechanically i was getting out in front of myself instead of keeping my weight back staying back on the rubber and he worked on some stuff with the timing of my hands it all seemed to work
7026490 i just stayed back and tried to execute my pitches as best i could go right at em instead of nit pick just be aggressive
7026491 most everything was fastballs tonight and i was able to move the ball around the zone and up and down
7026492 he reached back and made some quality pitches at the right time how long has it been since he won a game seven starts i was just glad we got him a win
7026493 man it is never easy in this ballpark the infield is so hard they bounce balls up the middle for hits and the outfield is so big bloopers fall in they wear out your bullpen anything in the gap is a double
7026494 i think ive managed 90 to 95 games over my career in this park and you never feel comfortable ever until the last out no matter what the score you have to keep playing it is different than any other park that ive been in
7026495 they said my services are needed so i go where my services are needed
7026496 nobody from the reds has talked to me about it
7026497 im a second baseman well be getting alex gonzalez back next year and other than omar vizquel juan castro and john mcdonald hes the best shortstop i ever played with
7026498 i dont see the point in me going over there especially with alex gonzalez there
7026499 i dont write the lineup i just play i could play any position if i worked my butt off and put my mind to it when the reds traded for me they told me id be a utility guy and had me working in the outfield i could play any position they want me to do
7026500 im a second baseman man i am a second baseman if it comes to me going over there ill welcome it but im a second baseman
7026501 and id say im about two weeks away from coming back
7026502 i had a good day with jolbert cabrera and adam rosales standing in there for me i dialed it up a little more all in all my ball was live and the swings looked a bit awkward which means i had some deception i only threw fastballs and changeups but thats about all i throw anyway
7026503 now that you are eating raw 100 percent raw from the past 7 or 8 years do you think that your diet is completely adequate or are there supplements that you find absolutely necessary

7026508 when we decided to build the stadium i wanted to anticipate the possibility of financial restrictions so i concentrated on youth i also felt the best way to create an identity with the way we play football to get players integrated into our culture with our beliefs our values was to get them as young as possible and to develop them together i felt it would be an interesting experiment to see players grow together with these qualities and with a love for the club it was an idealistic vision of the world of football

7026521 john mccains newfound concern for those without healthcare would be touching if he werent pushing a plan that would leave millions without insurance and raise taxes on benefits for the first time
7026522 but when a man loses track of the number of houses he owns its not surprising that hes lost touch with those who fear losing their health coverage
7026523 presidential races are close and we expect this one to be no different
7026524 but they should figure out how to spin the fact that john mccain owns a dozen houses and thinks the fundamentals of our economy are strong before trying to spin our convention
7026525 yes john mccain whats that you say hmmm thats exactly what id expect from someone who doesnt remember how many houses he owns a guy like that wouldnt know what real people are going through with foreclosure threats to their own houses the burden of health care costs and the lousy bush economy

7026552 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7026553 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7026554 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
7026555 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
7026556 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
7026557 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
7026558 one desire has been the ruling passion of my life one high motive has acted like a spur upon my mind and soul and sooner should i seek escape from the sacred necessity that is laid upon me let the breath of life fail me it is this that in spite of all worldly opposition gods holy ordinances shall be established again in the home in the school and in the state for the good of the people to carve as it were into the conscience of the nation the ordinances of the lord to which the bible and creation bear witness until the nation pays homage again to god
7026559 if i had to hand out a rookie of the year award for hockey blogging for the 2006 07 nhl season one of the top contenders for the award would have to be the forechecker
7026560 since forechecker is the albert einstein of the hockey blogosphere you best believe him
7026561 the strong public interest here in access to the information about a case involving millions of taxpayer dollars outweighs the desire of the committee and or debtor to evade public scrutiny
7026562 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
7026563 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal

7026567 marriage will be recognised in the tax system if i am davids chancellor which i fully expect to be then i will implement that

7026570 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7026571 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7026572 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7026573 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7026574 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7026575 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7026576 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7026577 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7026578 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7026579 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7026580 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7026581 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7026582 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7026583 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7026584 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7026585 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7026586 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7026587 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7026588 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7026589 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7026590 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7026591 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7026592 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7026593 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7026594 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7026595 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7026596 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7026597 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7026598 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7026599 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7026600 a threshold was cracked on monday when barack obama mentor state senate president emil jones announced his retirement and then said he wants his heretofore unheard of son emil jones iii to replace him
7026601 voted present a third of the time he was in the senate
7026602 maverick was against offshore oil drilling before he was for it
7026603 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7026604 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7026605 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7026606 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7026607 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7026608 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7026609 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7026610 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7026611 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7026612 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7026613 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7026614 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7026615 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7026616 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7026617 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7026618 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7026619 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7026620 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7026621 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7026622 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7026623 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7026624 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7026625 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7026626 this is a planning took where all things are going
7026627 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7026628 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7026629 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7026630 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7026631 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7026632 limited edition sku across all pal territories that we havent been able to make available for australian consumers
7026633 any consumers who want more space the options still available to purchase a notebook drive and upgrade
7026634 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7026635 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7026636 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7026637 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7026638 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7026639 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7026640 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7026641 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7026642 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7026643 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7026644 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7026645 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7026646 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7026647 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7026648 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7026649 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7026650 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7026651 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7026652 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7026653 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7026654 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7026655 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7026656 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7026657 da lasse ich mich berraschen was das leben mir anbietet
7026658 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7026659 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7026660 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7026661 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7026662 instead of focusing on the burn victims the nurses kept repeating you drove them here
7026663 got a low rating from abortion rights groups 60 in 2007 39 in 2003
7026664 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7026665 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7026666 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7026667 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

7026678 wir m ssen als team weiterhin hart zusammenarbeiten und hoffen dass michelin schnell f r den rest der saison den trend umkehren kann damit wir uns wieder in die top 10 arbeiten k nnen wir m ssen die moral aufrecht erhalten
7026679 wir brauchen gro e verbesserungen von michelin es scheint als w rde der gute start den wir in die saison hatten nun lange zur ck liegen und jetzt m ssen wir mit michelin arbeiten und versuchen die probleme zu l sen weil ich in tschechien nicht wirklich viel spa hatte
7026680 zuerst m ssen wir unseren fahrern und den teams f r all ihre arbeit die sie ber das wochenende erledigt haben ein dankesch n sagen sie haben uns geholfen so gut es geht nat rlich liegt uns die performance unserer reifen und die ergebnisse von tschechien schwer im magen
7026681 wir wussten dass es f r unsere fahrer extrem schwierig werden w rde weil wir seit freitag ziemliche probleme mit der leistung der vorderrad reifen hatten wir haben gewusst dass der front reifen unsere fahrer im rennen vor echte probleme stellen w rde
7026682 wir m ssen nun die probleme verstehen mit denen wir uns hier auseinander gesetzt sahen wir m ssen unsere performance auf strecke wie br nn drastisch verbessern jetzt tun wir unser maximum um uns auf bestm gliche weise auf misano vorzubereiten das ist eine andere strecke und eine andere herausforderung

7026685 what he does as part of his routine is to gee up the crowd they speed up and then slow down the music and create a whirlpool effect in the crowd
7026686 they the crowd all get geed up and then they start fighting

7026691 denounced s poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7026692 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7026693 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president

7026738 many individuals who congress intended to protect under the ada including people with epilepsy diabetes and cancer are no longer protected as a result of these court decisions these cases have created a bizarre catch 22 where people with serious conditions like epilepsy or diabetes could be forced to choose between treating their conditions and forfeiting their protections under the ada or not treating their conditions and being protected
7026739 serial ada litigation is a cynical money making scheme and that professional ada plaintiffs engage in systematic extortion designed to harass and intimidate business owners into agreeing to cash settlements
7026740 weve done all we can in good faith and these people are never satisfied
7026741 people can say theyve made parking or a restaurant accessible but whether it is truly accessible doesnt seem to matter some accessible parking is on gravel or dirt or on an incline all of which impede wheelchair travel just because its marked accessible doesnt mean it is
7026742 many of us in the disability field continue to talk about savings to the taxpayer through deinstitutionalization we can serve individuals better and less expensively in the community than in large institutions so the reasoning is that when we serve an individual in the community were saving tax dollars in fact what happens is that the number of individuals who live in institutions remains constant when we move someone out they move someone else in right behind them how do we get the legislature to see that in order to save tax dollars we have to actually decrease the number of people who are institutionalized we cant continue to operate dual systems if the idea is to save money
7026743 the average legislator has too many issues to think about to get involved in this kind of argument you guys need to come up with a position that you can all agree on and bring it to the legislature with one voice youll never get anywhere by continuing to sound as if youre divided

7026760 large companies are putting together server farms of tens of thousands of computers even approaching 100 thousand and the big challenge is to interconnect all these computers so that they can talk to each other as quickly as possible without incurring significant costs
7026761 we are proposing a new topology for ethernet data center connectivity
7026762 our work addresses the problem of data center network connectivity in a world where consolidation is increasingly taking place in data centers
7026763 the history of computing and technology has an innumerable set of examples where commodity parts take over the functionality of more specialized pieces of equipment
7026764 but that commoditization hasnt taken place on the communications side so we do have these specialized components still living in the network infrastructure that incur significant costs and complexity
7026765 the other issue is that people are treating the data center as a mini internet
7026766 thats fine but they are then forced to use the same components they might use in the wide area network with a bunch of concerns that dont come up in the data center environment adversarial environments attacks parties that might not trust each other etc so you have a lot of functionalities in these specialized switching components that you really dont need in your data center and you wind up paying for it in dollars and in complexity
7026767 independent of whether our technique is successful or someone elses is five years from now switching and communication infrastructure in the datacenter will be based on these small commodity building blocks
7026768 one of the big benefits of our approach is that it scales trivially to 10 gige at the edge whereas competing techniques rely on aggregation to ever faster links to achieve higher speeds
7026769 if you were to go to 10 gige at the edge for servers today you would need to aggregate to 40 gige or 100 gigelinks moving up the tree topology unfortunately the 40gbps ethernet standard isnt even out yet and when it does become available it will be very expensive because were using identical network elements in our topology today 48 port 10 gige ethernet switches are becoming relatively inexpensive so we would scale trivially to that environment as well
7026770 from a cost perspective to build out a 25 000 node cluster today using current techniques with 100 percent bandwidth just the switching equipment would cost somewhere in the order of 28 million whereas with our technique using the identical network elements would deliver the same performance but incur costs of maybe 4 million thats a factor of seven difference
7026771 it should be pretty easy for video game developers to integrate our research into new games as a game developer myself i know first hand that stretched out and flickering backgrounds and details are no longer acceptable in 3d video games
7026772 people are looking for ways to get rid of these distortions preferably without having to pay artists to generate background and detail images by hand we have come up with a way to do this and we are planning to provide code for download soon
7026773 the existing methods for using computer generated noise to make images for backgrounds and details for 3d video games are fast but the images that you get dont look very good our work gives you the full computational benefit of noise but without many of the tradeoffs such as distortion and flickering
7026774 the graphics generated from the procedural approach that we explored in this project are very small illustrating video games with small images is going to be increasingly important in the future as more and more games are downloadable
7026775 when one pixel covers a large area in a 3d video game landscapewhat color should that pixel be it can only be one color but the area it covers may contain many different colors
7026776 the beauty of the net framework has always been that it makes it easier for developers to build applications that are visually stunning well connected and highly secure
7026777 however we want to make sure we are keeping the end user experience in mind as well which is why we created the net framework client profile the net framework client profile significantly speeds up the installation of windows and enables a much more consumer friendly experience this is a huge step forward for the more than 4 million net developers worldwide
7026778 managing thousands of processor cores and multiple types of processors is a challenge we see every day and it will only grow in the future
7026779 the ibm hpc stack and other items in the repository help open source supercomputer users and systems managers keep pace with the rapid advances in cluster computing they are in constant need of improved software components since the hardware advances so quickly
7026780 the first products will look like a gpu but future products who knows
7026781 pcs are the hidden energy hogs of the home and most users have no idea that they are needlessly throwing away 80 percent of their pcs energy
7026782 if just 1 percent of all pcs used edison we could potentially reduce environmental impacts by 7 billion pounds of co2 which is equal to taking more than a half million cars off the road by finding ways to embed offsets in our daily life even something as simple as downloading software we will create permanent reductions in energy use and have a huge impact on our environment and resource sustainability

7026784 it was a great time to be into christian music because it was the early 1990s when dc talks jesus freak came out and audio adrenaline was having its first big hits and even jars of clay had their first couple of albums

7026790 when it comes to delivering superior software development organizations are faced with a number of challenges code complexity pace of change and constrained resources to name just a few
7026791 software readiness manager provides development managers working in todays fast paced development environments with actionable data they need to help their teams deliver software that is fully prepared to perform in the field before it is released
7026792 we are excited that gos 3 gadgets can introduce small applications for small laptops by connecting with the google gadgets for linux platform and its vast application database
7026793 with this version of gos we are delivering a linux that is ready for consumers a linux for the rest of us
7026794 we are pleased that gos is working with the lxde community to achieve faster boot time and response
7026795 we think gos will be even better for consumer netbooks and nettops with some of lxdes enhancements
7026796 the pigeon problem in stamford has got worse and worse over the last five or six years
7026797 we have been getting lots of complaints about the mess they are making and it has now got to the extent where it is uncontrollable
7026798 i heard about the pigeon pill and i think its a good idea provided only the pigeons get hold of it
7026799 while we would applaud any pigeon control programme that is non lethal and humane the contraceptive ovocontrol p has a long way to go before it satisfies picas uk that it is wholly non lethal humane and cost effective
7026800 we more often get calls from people about physical symptoms like lack of sleep headaches and lack of concentration peoples coping mechanisms are different and we try to help them find healthy ways to cope that can help them through difficult times
7026801 for some people food is where they find their comfort but it is not a long term solution
7026802 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
7026803 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again

7026805 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7026806 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7026807 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7026808 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement

7026817 how much those life vests weigh and the answer is not very much
7026818 but when youre trying to save every bit of money you can to make the airline more productive every bit counts
7026819 says to me that the financial circumstances of the airline industry are in such disarray that a 1 per cent cost is being considered worthwhile
7026820 i think accumulatively its making air travel a relatively unpleasant experience
7026821 the person has to hold on to it and the difficulty there is if the water is cold you cant hang on very long before your fingers and your hands wont respond
7026822 its standard that any airplane has to be evacuated within a couple of minutes and if youve got everybody standing up in the aisles trying to tear up their seat cushion and carry it under their arms and get out a hatch its really going to slow things down

7026831 im gonna give it one more last kick at the can
7026832 aber daf r muss ich dir eine gegenfrage stellen wie wichtig sind dir gesundheit lebensfreude ausstrahlung und selbstsicherheit
7026833 auch das ist mir sehr wichtig aber was soll das
7026834 alles das kannst du nur verbessern wenn du dich in deinem k rper wohl f hlst und er so funktioniert wie es eigentlich von der natur vorgegeben ist aber aufgrund von vielen ereignissen im leben wie unf lle st rze und schiksalschl ge und die tatsache dass wir uns viel zu wenig bewegen ver ndert sich unser k rper er ger t aus dem gleichgewicht und funktioniert nicht mehr so wie es sein soll die folgen sind meistens irgendwelche unspezifischen schmerzen oder m digkeit oder antriebslosigkeit oder irgendwelche andere dinge die einem das leben schwerer machen
7026835 mein r cken schmerzt regelm ig und ich kann nicht mehr richtig schlafen das ist halt so wenn mal lter wird
7026836 das ist der gr te denkfehler der menschheit bezogen auf die gesundheit der dazu f hrt dass viele menschen sich ihren schmerzen und leiden ergeben das muss nicht sein man kann auch im hohen alter ohne probleme und vital das leben genie en
7026837 na dann erkl r mir das mal das w re ja super toll wenn das stimmt
7026838 sonst h tte man ja st ndig probleme mit dem haus
7026839 aber was ist der grund daf r dass die statik so wichtig ist welche kraft wirkt denn st ndig auf das haus ein
7026840 na die schwerkraft wirkt st ndig auf das haus ein und wenn die statik vom haus nicht stimmt dann macht die schwerkraft das haus nach und nach kaputt
7026841 und wie ist es mit deinem k rper wirkt auf deinen k rper nicht auch st ndig die schwerkraft ein und wie schaut es mit deiner k rperstatik aus glaubst du sie ist in ordnung
7026842 aber was kann ich dagegen unternehmen ich m chte nicht noch mehr probleme mit meinem k rper bekommen ich m chte so lange wie m glich gesund und vital bleiben was kann ich machen
7026843 ich denn ich bin ein rolfer rolfing hilft dir deinen k rper kennen zu lernen rolfing verbessert deine k rperstatik und zeigt dir wie du dich im schwerkraftfeld richtig bewegst und jetzt sind wir wieder bei meiner ausgangsfrage wenn deine k rperstatik optimal ist und du dich optimal bewegst kannst du dir dann vorstellen dass deine gesundheit deine ausstrahlung deine lebensfreude deine selbstsicherheit deine leistungsf higkeit und viele andere dinge besser werden

7026848 a large scale breeding operation in which the dogs receive little food little water no veterinary care poor housing and consistent breeding over and over again with the intent of making profit from the sale of puppies
7026849 when i arrived at the home i saw a big sign reading cockers for sale
7026850 i went in and asked the man there if he had any puppies i didnt tell him i worked for the animal shelter
7026851 there were at least two dead puppies in one cage and the owner tried to push their feet back up
7026852 the man was trying to pressure me to buy a puppy but i said i had to talk it over first with my husband and went home
7026853 i asked what we could do to help these dogs
7026854 these dogs were going to die down there unless we acted soon
7026855 mcmanamon spoke with the owner and convinced him to surrender the dogs to us
7026856 there were at least two very pregnant cocker spaniels and a pregnant chihuahua
7026857 what i saw today shocked me both as a member of this community and as a veterinarian
7026858 no animal should be treated so poorly and i am committed to seeing that these dogs get a better life and those responsible for these conditions are brought to justice
7026859 these dogs have had no socialization so well have to give them a lot of love
7026860 they have no idea that a human isnt going to hurt them
7026861 they all need baths and we will give them heartworm tests they were all covered with fleas and their own urine and feces one chihuahuas leg is limping weve got a poodle with an old wound in her foot from being caught in a crate
7026862 the driving force to hire him was his background in child welfare agencies
7026863 he basically started the kids hope united miami division from scratch its been very positive and done well during the six years he was down there
7026864 i really wasnt looking to return to illinois but this presented such a unique opportunity
7026865 ive always had a fondness and love for cunningham it was a difficult decision but one i felt i was ready to make
7026866 its a great opportunity to have an impact and its an exciting time for illinois
7026867 they the state is doing a lot of innovative things in child welfare nationally theyve always been seen as an innovator
7026868 there are a lot of people who are just like me who dont have anybody
7026869 every year our program has to cobble together the money
7026870 we havent even been able to touch quality of life trips
7026871 if i cant get out the world becomes my house
7026872 every county courthouse in illinois has a statue in the stylized lincoln cliche style
7026873 this would not be one of those it would attract some pretty strong feelings
7026874 this is capable of becoming an iconic thing that would make this community known
7026875 i think it would draw attention to urbana in a way i would rather not draw attention to urbana
7026876 public art is one of most difficult issues communities face
7026877 art is so subjective what weve been thinking about is how and why lincoln was in urbana as a politician as a lawyer as a friend and this doesnt seem to do it
7026878 i want to engage the people who live here guys like steve beckett and make them confront how they feel about lincoln maybe give me some input
7026879 i wanted to capture the mount rushmore feeling generous large significant
7026880 with the addition of the stovepipe hat its even more so
7026881 not just the one you see at every county courthouse
7026882 every time i drive by and look at this empty plaza i see this giant head
7026883 any information that he received has been acted upon immediately and has been documented
7026884 im not sure thats right that there was no report made
7026885 dude so do you want this back when im done ill just leave it in the hallway
7026886 but the canadians have universal health care and it works for them
7026887 weve added to our reserves in all of our major funds we try to be fiscally responsible and this board of education has done a very good job of that we want to make sure we have the facilities and supplies we need to educate our children
7026888 i think with the younger kids well see more of an impact with this since its an ongoing project we still want to expose older students to it to give them a chance to improve their writing skills as well

7026897 i have had no word about arsenal wanting gareth barry and that is all i want to say on the subject other than that we are working towards improving our squad
7026898 dr thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on all the entities the club the premier league he never intended this
7026899 the problems with players who are 27 28 is that you pay big money but you get nothing back no resale
7026900 ive heard nothing from arsene wenger himself so it is strange
7026901 we have 11 days left before the transfer deadline and we are working at something but you never know in football
7026902 i believe that emmanuel has been unfairly treated because he had a lot of interest from many big clubs and he always told me one to one his preference was to stay in the end he stayed
7026903 that story did not come out like that in the press and unfortunately he is paying a price for a story which is not really him
7026904 he made a press conference in austria where people interpreted his statements a bit differently but i know what he told me and i know he made sacrifices to stay
7026905 i was convinced he wanted to stay but i was not always convinced he would stay because there is a big difference in that
7026906 there is lots of speculation but anton is part of my plans he is in here trying to get fit
7026907 matthew upson and calum davenport are playing at the moment tompkins and collins are still out daniel gabbidon has been since november
7026908 the nearest one to go back in is anton and that is where we are at at the moment
7026909 i spoke to him in the summer and we will see how it develops but as far as i am concerned he is in here every day trying to get fit
7026910 my players are being linked with other clubs and it shows we have got some decent players
7026911 if a player is out for a certain period there is no point rushing it
7026912 you may as well wait the extra week or two to make sure they dont suffer any setbacks
7026913 sometimes the age of a player helps with their recovery
7026914 i dont know what the player wright phillips is thinking about with regards to offers from other teams
7026915 if i have 24 to 25 players with me and three or four for two positions then im happy
7026916 daar kan ik momenteel nog niet op antwoorden ik raad u aan om de website in het oog te houden

7026919 elizabeth police made two arrests following a terrifying incident where a woman had a car stolen while she was sitting in it
7026920 given the way the suspension was chewed up on the ford id say they were travelling around 80km h or more when they hit
7026921 the good news is the victim got out pretty much unscathed because it could have been much worse
7026922 its a real worry this type of thing could happen in the middle of the day in a busy car park
7026923 ive got three kids and this makes you more conscious of who is behind you or possibly hanging around your car
7026924 it doesnt surprise me any more that these things can be happening
7026925 not everyone wants a dog due to lack of time and many other reasons
7026926 i think the misconception comes from the way they eat theyre only messy when they eat and that is because they get so excited
7026927 hes part of our family instead of having a baby we got a pig theyre just like another child theyve got the same habits
7026928 i really wanted one from about eight years ago and then i saw him at the pet store and thought i want him
7026929 we feed merlin the same time as the kids otherwise he cries
7026930 he eats a lot of fruit and vegetables coleslaw peeled and boiled potatoes carrots pasta weetbix bananas he loves bananas its his fetish
7026931 we play chasey with him we try to teach him how to play soccer
7026932 they can play with you and they wont scratch you
7026933 he comes and snuggles up in your bed hes very nice
7026934 were trying to teach him how to play soccer at the moment but well teach him a few more tricks when the weather heats up he doesnt like the rain
7026935 pigs have a mind of their own provided you respect their space theyll respect yours
7026936 as far as i am aware its the first time a prisoner and those working with him outside have been charged with drug trafficking
7026937 its also the first time a prisoners bank accounts have been frozen and their contents seized
7026938 those tempted to act as agents in this type of activity should be warned they also face such charges if they are transferring money for and on behalf of prisoners in drug transactions
7026939 the pcs is a dedicated unit that can work on one job properly
7026940 what we are doing is already having an impact on reducing drugs in prisons when they realise what we are doing they will change their tactics and we will then change our methods accordingly
7026941 als je al zo lang programmas met elkaar maakt komt onvermijdelijk het moment waarop het genoeg geweest is
7026942 wij verwachten dat dit andere creatieve bedrijven aantrekt voor de werkgelegenheid van de stad is het eveneens een goede zaak mtv networks heeft meer dan 160 werknemers
7026943 im sure mr hamilton smith will release his costings explaining where hes taking it from
7026944 no one would make such an announcement without having done detailed costings
7026945 it would be great if it means all those sports facilities that we dont have are built
7026946 an enormous amount of facilities are lacking at that level we need facilities right through sport that would set us up for years to come santos stadium is not up to standard the track is crumbling and it does not have a warm up track which is a requirement
7026947 hockey is not up to standard because we dont have more than one pitch at the one place and even the proposed new pool at marion would have to meet fina standards
7026948 i would absolutely love a city super stadium imagine an upgrade of adelaide oval and a major indoor stadium next door
7026949 this will require a complete audit of sporting infrastructure for this state
7026950 i can see the games not being isolated to adelaide but involving regional sa with opportunities for the south east port lincoln and upper spencer gulf towns
7026951 the federal and state governments have record surpluses this can be done
7026952 adelaide oval will clearly be part of the action and a new world class sporting stadium will also be part of the action
7026953 we have options of a new city stadium close to transport or a world class revamp of west lakes but the case for a stadium in the city is compelling

7026962 we are having a meeting next wednesday about a lot of things and contracts will be one of the things discussed
7026963 there are other players to discuss as well im fairly relaxed about it but i will know more when we sit down
7026964 i dont know what the player wright phillips is thinking about with regards to offers from other teams
7026965 if i have 24 to 25 players with me and three or four for two positions then im happy
7026966 the problems with players who are 27 28 is that you pay big money but you get nothing back no resale

7026984 transfers have to be organised at the end of the season not five days before the start of the season this shows a lack of respect towards the club its history and the fans
7026985 also the offer we have received shows how little chelsea value the player
7026986 real are not going to sell robinho it is another matter if he wants to leave well then he should go but it is not the right way to do it by telling the media
7026987 he should put it in writing to us to resolve his contract and the matter will be closed we dont keep anyone against their will at this club slavery was abolished a long time ago
7026988 if tomorrow he says he doesnt want to go that he was only floating the idea then we can sit and talk about his future in spain

7026990 toen hij haar hoorde kreunen wist edward dat zijn geluk nagenoeg compleet was hij had het gevoel van een heerlijke gewichteloosheid alsof hij centimeters boven de grond stond zodat hij behaaglijk boven haar uittorende het gaf een pijnlijk genot zoals zijn hart omhoog leek te komen en bonsde onder in zijn keel hij was opgetogen over de lichte aanraking van haar handen niet zo heel ver van zijn lies en over de meegaandheid van haar prachtige lichaam in zijn armen en het hartstochtelijke geluid van haar snelle ademhaling door haar neusgaten het bracht hem in een ongekende extase koud en scherp ergens vlak onder de ribben zoals haar tong zacht de zijne omgaf als hij ertegen duwde misschien kon hij haar eerdaags overhalen misschien vanavond al en wie weet hoefde ze wel niet te worden overgehaald om zijn pik in haar zachte mooie mond te nemen maar dit was een gedachte die hij zo snel als hij kon achter zich moest laten want hij liep echt het gevaar om te vroeg te komen hij kon het begin al voelen en de schande was nabij
7026991 want als je dat niet doet moet je je afvragen waar het eindigt
7026992 were just hoping were getting to the end at some point
7026993 the doctors health is very poor were pleased to have reached this state
7026994 there was a push an interest in using growth hormones to fight aging
7026995 its just a situation where the laws are very strict in this area
7026996 what we proposed 18 months ago would not fit the bill for what the air force is looking for
7026997 i get a feeling that they are perhaps playing delay tactics
7026998 they could probably get even more time if say the democrats win
7026999 whether either of the contractors submits a proposalis entirely up to them
7027000 it must provide adequate time for competitors to offer bids
7027001 however the afghan interior ministry said u s coalition bombs killed 76 civilians including
7027002 lets take an oath on the quraan this time that i will fulfil all my promises
7027003 lets take an oath on the quraan this time that i will fulfil all my promises
7027004 i dont want to swear on the quraan for political objectives but i would expect that all promises would be fulfilled
7027005 dr thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on all the entities the club the premier league he never intended this
7027006 dr thaksin has been really open about this he has said to me if you need me to resign from the football club as a director because it would serve the needs of the premier league then im fine with that as long as that doesnt change any other thing
7027007 i think there is a very loose term about what is fit and proper it is almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
7027008 dr thaksin is in a political situation and a case that affects his assets so thats well documented so thats a hurdle
7027009 the truth of it is this club is not going to go out of business this club is not bankrupt were moving forward
7027010 that the head of state makes the most of every national and international occasion to present himself denigrating and demeaning the media the national press association interprets this attitude as reflecting a government strategy
7027011 nothing in the constitution shall prevent majlis e shoora parliament from making any law indemnifying any person in the service of the federal government or any other person in respect of any act done in connection with the maintenance or restoration of order in any area in pakistan
7027012 if martial law is a law and its limits are prescribed by necessity then all acts done by the military which are either justified by the civil law or were dictated by necessity and done in flood sic faith will be protected even if there be no bill of indemnity
7027013 de meer begon de eerste helft goed er werd net iets meer gevoetbald op de helft van sdo
7027014 sdo had de meer na een wat onrustige aanvangfase snel onder controle en kwam regelmatig gevaarlijk voor de amsterdamse goal
7027015 did i help make that kid what about that one
7027016 delgado will tell her how much money they made so she can tell him how much shell take out

7027019 es ist unn tig und damit unverh ltnism ig dieselben daten der b rger nun noch einmal beim bund aufzubewahren
7027020 sollte auch der staat sich h ten verzichtbare neue datensammlungen anzulegen
7027021 we want to free up more money to raise skills and get more people to a degree level
7027022 it really brings the point home that their loved ones arent coming home
7027023 i almost sort of wanted to sneak in and not have anyone notice that i came home because those are the real heroes
7027024 my heart goes out to their families its a tremendous loss
7027025 i almost feel guilty because weve lost three more soldiers
7027026 and here i am just overwhelmed and so filled with joy that my husband is home and so grateful that hes home alive
7027027 the whole focus was to allow them to survive once were ready to leave
7027028 it was probably the best time ive ever had in my life not for fun but for self fulfilment
7027029 they really want to be able to take their country over for themselves but they know they cant do it they need help
7027030 yang jelas selamat buat baim dan artika mereka memutuskan untuk menikah berarti mereka telah menemukan belahan jiwa mereka masing masing

7027032 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7027033 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7027034 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7027035 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7027036 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7027037 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7027038 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7027039 could the shaikh give us some words of benefit for the blessed month of ramadaan on this fine occasion
7027040 allaah the exalted and most high says in the noble quraan
7027041 whoever does not abandon falsehood in speech and action then allaah has no need that he should leave his food and drink
7027042 my ummah will continue to be upon good for as long as they hasten to break the fast and delay the pre dawn meal
7027043 my ummah will continue to be upon good for as long as they hasten to pray the maghrib prayer
7027044 and the sun has set then the fasting persons fast is broken
7027045 if one of us had climbed onto his camel he would have seen the sun
7027046 my ummah will continue upon good for as long as they hasten to break the fast
7027047 if one of you hears the call to prayer and the vessel is in the hand of one of you then let him not put it down until he fulfils his need from it
7027048 if one of you hears the call to prayer and the vessel
7027049 if one of you hears the call to prayer and the vessel is in his hand then let him not put it down until he fulfils his need from it
7027050 because he gives the adhaan in order to awaken the person who is sleeping and so that the person who wishes to eat the pre dawn meal can do so so eat and drink until ibn umm maktoon gives the
7027051 if one of you hears the call to prayer and the vessel is in his hand then let him not put it down until he has fulfilled his need from it
7027052 if someone hears the adhaan and has some food in his mouth then he must spit it out
7027053 beware of ghuluww exceeding the limits in the religion because those who came before you were destroyed by their exceeding the limits in their religion
7027054 if one of you hears the call to prayer whilst the vessel is in his hand then let him not put it down until he has completed his need from it
7027055 allaah loves that his allowances be acted upon just as he loves that his prescribed duties be carried out
7027056 just as he hates that disobedience to him be committed
7027057 allaah loves that his allowances be acted upon just as he loves that his prescribed duties be carried out
7027058 our brothers for the sake of allaah as salafiyyoon the brothers at al maktabatus salafiyyah and islamic centre salafi publications in the city of birmingham in great britain then they are mentioned with goodness and love for the sunnah and calling to it and for waging war against bidah and partisanship hizbiyyah
7027059 indeed salafi publications is a blessed maktabah and i have taught there on numerous occasions over several years i do not know them except to be upon the correct way and the correct methodology and the sunnah up until this day and i have not seen from them any extremism or any harshness
7027060 i have known al maktabah as salafiyyah in birmingham britain for many years and they and all priase is due to allaah are upon the manhaj and upon goodness and we do not know from them except goodness
7027061 and i am thankful to the brothers in charge of this maktabah as salafiyyah due to what they have established by their efforts in the path of dawah to goodness and guidance and dawah to the people to the religion the religion of islaam and their dawah to the muslims to the way of the truth the path of ahlus sunnah ahlul hadeeth wal athar
7027062 las razones para que se pueda recorrer m s o menos pista en el despegue son m ltiples y variadas
7027063 el piloto apura al m ximo las posibilidades que da la pista
7027064 hay una prolongaci n de seguridad de la pista y parece que el avi n no coge la altura que en situaciones de normalidad estamos acostumbrados a ver un avi n a mitad de pista coge altura y aqu necesita m s pista para alcanzar esos metros
7027065 hemos estado muy descontentos con la reacci n de la compa a en los primeros momentos reconoci no solamente el gobierno de canarias sino que tambi n el presidente del gobierno me ha trasladado que la compa a no estuvo a la altura
7027066 the whole school the teachers and the students alike are in great shock after a tragedy that should never have happened it was difficult to carry out classes in the afternoon
7027067 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
7027068 we will have to see what other issues were present
7027069 my view is that the buffer zones are against the spirit of the ceasefire agreement
7027070 why do they want to take control of poti they do not have such a right
7027071 maybe they want to grab poti from us while we are still alive we will not allow them to stay here if they were our friends they would not do this
7027072 should we sit behind the fence what use would we be then they georgian forces will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them
7027073 neither did your mom he was a mean man and he was awful to your grandmother
7027074 i was the eldest of eight and we were dirt poor when i told dad i was leaving for school that fall he picked up a two by four and tried to hit me i outran him but i had to duck him until i left
7027075 ive just dropped a silent one what should i do
7027076 this land is your land this land is my land
7027077 im taking seniors out of their comfort zones in a way that they dont realize theyre out of their comfort zones
7027078 im just trying to dispel the myth that the brain dies after you turn 60
7027079 the more senses that are involved during a learning experience the better a person remembers
7027080 for many they feel empowered to have control over their lives
7027081 many feel they have a loss of control because theyre in a facility like this
7027082 its improved my thinking i just enjoy myself all the more
7027083 i finally had the courage to dance for the first time in seven years
7027084 so many people say they cant taste anymore as they grow older but they dont realize its their brains that arent working not their tongues
7027085 when they start exercising their brains theyre suddenly able to taste
7027086 the class made me realize the things i had been failing in
7027087 i recognized my brain has a big control over what we do you cant go wrong if you acknowledge these things
7027088 i grew up with trains and mom used to feed hobos i had an uncle that was a hobo
7027089 i doubt there is anyone living here that doesnt have a relative whos been a hobo during the depression everyone was looking for work
7027090 in the depression men traveled to work now they work to travel
7027091 were just family in a true sense the people here are not hobos but were as close as youre going to get
7027092 its just the travel i enjoyed hitchhiking you can see things you cant see traveling 70 miles per hour on the road
7027093 as long as there are trains running someone is gonna get on it
7027094 until they pull the rails up there will be a rail rider somewhere
7027095 the docs tell me i got the wanderlust its a disease like alcoholism i gotta keep moving why i can go coast to coast on a piece of toast get it
7027096 i saw an article last real hobo calls it quits
7027097 they are people who are different they need to travel its a calling
7027098 they cant live a conventional lifestyle that was probably the biggest problem between my father and mother
7027099 its the last free adventure in america its the wanderlust the spirit of adventure to hop a freight train sometimes you know where it is going and sometimes you dont
7027100 its risky and its illegal and you can get hurt but it is still a great adventure
7027101 i traveled from one side of the united states to the other from early 1950 through the 1970s
7027102 i was with the topographical union and worked at papers in san francisco st louis and the new york times i could do that because i had a trade
7027103 rarely if ever in the history of work and labor has a group of craftsmen enjoyed as much freedom dignity and mobility as those engaged in the art of printing to properly master the art of printing after finishing several years of apprenticeship it was almost obligatory to journey from one shop to another from one town to another even between countries jobs and opportunities expanded with each new printshop established printers knew they were in demand and were tempted to change jobs frequently knowing they could travel from place to place with ease that their skills were always in demand
7027104 ones who never settled in one place were called tramps if i was working somewhere and didnt like it id move
7027105 then automation came in and wiped us all out in the 1980s ive been retired 10 years but i had a good life
7027106 a dysfunctional family situation has put youngsters on the road and other unfortunate circumstance has made a hobo out of many men
7027107 if we dont go on and move its going to continue to deteriorate so were at a crucial point
7027108 the evidence is overwhelming that there is a specialized system dedicated to processing faces and not other objects
7027109 why we are so good at recognizing and remembering faces
7027110 a brief glance at a face conveys a wealth of information about identity expression gender age mood intent attractiveness social states and even honesty
7027111 the ability to extract this information within a fraction of a second of viewing a face is important for normal social interaction and has probably played a critical role in the survival of our primate ancestors
7027112 just by looking at an fmri we can tell if a subject is looking at faces or places
7027113 death and life are in the power of the tongue
7027114 and what shall we live on while im writing it

7027151 this term appeared in its figurative sense around 1900 and refers to the top drawer in a bedroom dresser where society folks usually kept their jewels and other valuables
7027152 national conventions are almost always held in uncomfortable and filthy places
7027153 food is bad and expensive and everyone goes home exhausted and sore
7027154 there is something about a national convention that makes it as fascinating as a revival or a hanging
7027155 it is vulgar it is ugly it is stupid it is tedious it is hard upon both the higher cerebral centers and the gluteus maximus and yet it is somehow charming one sits through long sessions wishing all the delegates and alternates were dead and in hell and then suddenly there comes a show so gaudy and hilarious so melodramatic and obscene so unimaginably exhilarating and preposterous that one lives a gorgeous year in an hour
7027156 the party that wins the battle of the conventions will likely win the election
7027157 whether its a mouthpiece that is fitted properly thats actually custom fit to that person or a helmet that is in good condition
7027158 people who end up with concussion symptoms that day arent going to return that day

7027168 i felt like he was probably overall the most impressive quarterback today and think overall justin made up some ground
7027169 the question mark is jeremiah masoli if his wrist is ready to go
7027170 certainly darren thomas and chris harper will both get work

7027188 for the safety of the crew we cannot disclose too much but we call on the un and the international community to take urgent steps and stop the worsening security situation in these waters
7027189 we are very concerned with the current situation we have been warning seafarers plying these waters on a regular basis as attacks are escalating
7027190 it is not just limited to the civilian nuclear initiative
7027191 several other issues will be discussed including what is happening around india
7027192 without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
7027193 establishing check points and buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7027194 may only be implemented in the immediate proximity of south ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of georgian territory
7027195 inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers from the administrative limit between south ossetia and the rest of georgia in a manner such that no significant urban zone would be included
7027196 so the russian side has complied with the agreements recorded in moscows medvedev sarkozy principles
7027197 there is a chance of escalation over the black sea feet

7027208 god ive been a true and faithful servant and have lived an exemplary life why wont you grant me this one thing

7027212 several hundred individuals known to be involved in or closely associated with violent extremist activity
7027213 one sided and possibly exaggerated accounts of actions from both sides
7027214 its been mentioned by much higher pay grades than mine
7027215 we think it is important to find ways to go forward in a transparent fashion with india as they develop nuclear energy
7027216 its too important given the size of indias economy given the size of its nuclear infrastructure and its aspirations in nuclear generation we need to find a way to embrace them in bring them into the tent
7027217 it was great the car was stable and straight as an arrow
7027218 before they showed me the timing i thought wed gone about 135mph 217km h
7027219 theres no perception of speed when youre out there except for the mile markers
7027220 i was just happy to be in the final its a stepping stone for me
7027221 its my first performance in a k1 final so i cant complain really i gave it everything i had
7027222 i had the edge taken off from yesterday i didnt quite have the gusto that i wanted from the first few strokes
7027223 i bided my time until halfway when i kicked i gave it everything i had and i caught up a fair bit but that last 100m i was starting to get jelly arms again
7027224 four more years to go weve got some great talent at home
7027225 theres a lot going to happen over the next four years which i think will be quite exciting with kayaking
7027226 it was a lot of confidence for me winning the semi i can go away and train a little bit harder and know what i need to work on to beat these guys
7027227 scarlett and ryan are taking it slow because ryan is busy working on obamas campaign scarlett who also supports obama wants to hold off until the election is over because hunter is so busy
7027228 this is where i won our only tri nations match in south africa
7027229 it means a lot less baggage among this crew you saw the benefits of that in the first match against the all blacks a while back but ever more importantly the mindset of this team is extremely positive which is quite different to where weve been
7027230 the environment is also somewhat more relaxed and it revolves around backing yourself so hopefully that will help drive us to get a better result
7027231 playing there at provincial level and with the wallabies you know that it is not an as confronting venue
7027232 when you play even at cape towns newlands those venues are on top of you and its like a cauldron there the crowds can at times be quite hostile whereas at kings park theres still massive south african support but it doesnt seem as if they are suffocating you
7027233 you could easily point to the fact that australia havent won over here for a long period of time
7027234 but thats not something which is a burden to them it isnt to this group because they havent been part of every step along the way
7027235 this is a unique gathering of players were now looking to use that opportunity the past is not an anchor for us in fact it is probably more of a stimulant
7027236 police officers need to be safe from offending like this when they are carrying out their duty
7027237 i dropped i guess from about two or three metres it was pretty big i must have fallen well
7027238 i was really winded but i guess i was up relatively quickly
7027239 i was way back off the pack from the very start other than that it was great i was picking off riders as i went through
7027240 i felt really good physically i felt really strong and technically most of the time i was really good there was just the one section i had trouble with
7027241 right now im thinking of taking an easy year next year to let my body recover
7027242 itll be the first time ive spent a long period there for a while
7027243 nuclear weapon proliferation is the single most immediate threat hanging over the world today mr keating said
7027244 turned its hand to new bunker busting nuclear weapons designed to attack underground facilities
7027245 the plain fact is there can be no non proliferation without de proliferation
7027246 that is if the weapons states are not prepared to rid themselves of nuclear weapons why would other states continue to deny themselves the kind of leverage which these weapons bring
7027247 the old order of victorious powers with major powers hanging onto weapons of massive destruction is a remnant of the violent 20th century mr keating said
7027248 it cannot provide the basis for an equitable and effective system of world governance
7027249 just as world community concerns have been ahead of the political system on issues such as global warming so too world community concern needs to galvanise international action to find a new template for a lasting peace one embracing all the major powers and regions
7027250 this can be done but it requires leadership and imagination

7027284 joe biden is an individual with a proven commitment to progressive issues and to speaking his mind about the values he holds dear
7027285 his foreign policy experience is well informed principled and visionary his long time leadership as a key member of the judiciary committee has been equally inspirational
7027286 i have witnessed the close relationship between senators biden and obama and i am sure they will be excellent partners in campaigning and in governance
7027287 from a new jersey perspective it is also exciting because many of us in new jersey have had a chance to get to know and work with him as a neighboring state senator
7027288 so do our troops hate the troops no of course not our troops love america and thats the point
7027289 gwen eaton is one of the most memorable characters oates has created to date

7027292 some people from the government encouraged us to fight against al qaeda but it seems that now that al qaeda is finished they dont want us anymore
7027293 sacrificed and fought against al qaeda and now the government wants to catch them and arrest them
7027294 we dont want this to be a dead end kick them to the curb kind of thing
7027295 transfers have to be organised at the end of the season not five days before the start of the season this shows a lack of respect towards the club its history and the fans
7027296 also the offer we have received shows how little chelsea value the player
7027297 real are not going to sell robinho it is another matter if he wants to leave well then he should go but it is not the right way to do it by telling the media
7027298 he should put it in writing to us to resolve his contract and the matter will be closed we dont keep anyone against their will at this club slavery was abolished a long time ago
7027299 if tomorrow he says he doesnt want to go that he was only floating the idea then we can sit and talk about his future in spain
7027300 this is a death sentence for these people whats left for them now is only to die
7027301 if they wont let anyone give us food or medicines do you think we have a chance for seed or fertilizer
7027302 what the hell do you mean he picked biden instead of me
7027303 thats the first thing that gets everybodys attention even when we go to a college on a recruiting visit he passes the test with the college players there just arent many high school linebackers who are 6 foot 2 235 pounds

7027320 we zullen toch minstens nog n keer moeten winnen om helemaal zeker te zijn ik denk niet dat scz de laatste drie wedstrijden zal winnen zelf moeten we nog naar bmc in berlicum en buren en krijgen thuis nog bezoek van dsc uit kerkdriel en emplina uit empel dat biedt perspectief
7027321 toen hadden we meer geluk en viel de bal er net in dit seizoen hebben we paar keer echt pech gehad
7027322 maar er waren ook wedstrijden die we gewoon niet konden winnen het verschil met de topploegen is erg groot we kunnen wel een keer stunten zoals met de overwinning in tiel op rktvc maar dat niveau kunnen wij geen competitie lang vasthouden
7027323 het zou best eens leuk zijn om mee te doen voor een prijs maar dat zit er nu nog niet in bzs betaalt niet zodat we het van eigen jongens moeten hebben de laatste drie jaar is er al veel jeugd doorgestroomd en er komen er nog meer aan zoals onder anderen mijn broer niels af en toe komen er nog wel eens spelers uit culemborg het bij ons proberen maar het elftal bestaan grotendeels uit spelers uit beusichem bzs is een echte vriendenclub bovendien is het in mijn ogen de gezelligste vereniging in de regio en we spelen ook nog eens in de vierde klasse en niet lager zoals veel clubs om ons heen
7027324 en vanaf de a jeugd toen ik achttien werd ben ik doorgestroomd naar het eerste elftal dat is al weer vier jaar geleden
7027325 overigens ben ik van origine een middenvelder de laatste tijd speel ik in de spits omdat we weinig aanvallers hebben echt in vorm ben ik niet ik heb pas twee keer gescoord dit seizoen wel moet ik erbij vertellen dat ik de eerste vijf wedstrijden op het middenveld heb gespeeld en geblesseerd ben geweest vorig seizoen was ik topscorer met zeven doelpunten dat is tevens ons probleem we hebben geen echte afmaker in de ploeg een werkpaard ben ik niet in de spits ik moet het vooral van mijn inzicht en techniek hebben net als bzs overigens dat probeert ook altijd te voetballen daarom kunnen we goed uit de voeten tegen de betere ploegen en hebben we moeite met fysiek sterke tegenstanders
7027326 ik zit hier prima ik hoop dat er aan het einde van het seizoen niemand weg gaat en we als groep verder kunnen groeien onder leiding van trainer jan van setten de beste trainer die ik ooit heb gehad
7027327 without political cultural or administrative subordination to the soviet union

7027354 hrc fans have been electrified by the late buzz on her dark horse potential
7027355 that is i havent heard anything to indicate that she is under serious consideration but that hasnt tamped down the hope
7027356 i believe the overwhelming polling data that senator clinton would have helped senator obama the most to win the election especially in battleground states
7027357 having said that i completely support the decision he has made as his alone and will support joe biden
7027358 joes smart and funny but this is not exactly an exciting choice
7027359 i know politics things just dont happen that way hillary knew that anyone who thought he would put her on the ticket is just clueless
7027360 its a big mistake not to choose her its sad and its a sure way to guarantee the republicans will win
7027361 obama cant do this on his own this ticket isnt going to be able to compete and cant overcome the lack of unity only hillary can bring them that
7027362 people will be disappointed that its not her on the ticket
7027363 but we hope that enough time has passed that her supporters have gotten over it and are in a place where they can support the partys ticket
7027364 shell go in shell wow them and shell get out of the way
7027365 if obama picks hillary he gets her 18 million supporters and we would win in a cakewalk and control the white house for 16 years
7027366 but on a political level i dont think shed be the best choice it wouldnt be a good match she brings some baggage and i think the fundamental problem is the bill factor the obama campaign knew they couldnt control him
7027367 if you look at what you have in life you will always have more if you look at what you do not have in life you will never have enough

7027371 this was not some youtube video put together in someones basement it was a professionally and carefully produced ad that had a much more sinister subtext that millions of americans will pick up on
7027372 this is the use of religion at its very worst in politics because it is an attempt to subtly and perhaps even subconsciously play on some of the deepest fears of millions of evangelical americans
7027373 this is absurd its obviously a lighthearted ad having some fun with senator obamas tendency to get carried away with audacious statements
7027374 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
7027375 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics

7027410 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
7027411 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7027412 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

7027468 a dreadful melancholy has drifted into my life as a thick fog and slowly lingers there day after day there seems to be no sign of it lifting it has been many weeks since i have enjoyed the warmth and brightness of the sun how do you resist that which you cannot see and touch what power has the mighty ship against the rolling fog the danger lies not so much in the fog itself but in the dangers hidden by the heavy mist a downcast soul is always at risk of suffering shipwreck in regard to the faith
7027469 when i kept silent my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long for day and night your hand was heavy upon me my strength was sapped as in the heat of the day
7027470 why are you downcast o my soul his remedy to the problem sheds much light on the source of his depression

7027503 this piece darkly reflects the introspective melancholy that was so much a part of the elizabethan temperament
7027504 information from this study could be the beginning of a systematic approach to develop a method of predicting pain threshold and morphine requirement for pain relief
7027505 it could also be inferred that the greater analgesic sensitivity to morphine in the aa group is also related to a higher risk of developing nausea

7027508 congratulations to michael phelps for winning eight olympic gold medals i applaud him and his mother for speaking about ad hd mr phelps shows that its possible to go beyond coping with ad hd and truly achieve his candor addresses stigma and hopefully will inspire others to seek help
7027509 its important for people living with ad hd to pursue interests they enjoy and at which they excel
7027510 phelpss success demonstrates that being a part of a supportive family setting goals engaging in enjoyable activities and receiving positive feedback are all important in building self esteem phelps is clearly an exceptionally talented athlete and a source of pride for the millions of people affected by ad hd
7027511 among men there is a deep stigma associated with seeking treatment for ad hd i hope that michael phelpss openness conveys to young men that its okay to seek treatment that it is part of a wise game plan
7027512 its obvious to everyone who watched the olympic games that mr phelps has an engaged supportive and enthusiastic family who helped him find his right fit with swimming
7027513 when a triggering agent such as a volatile anesthetic is introduced into an mh susceptible persons body increased temperature and muscle rigidity can occur leading to muscle damage and release of ions and proteins into the blood
7027514 this can result in the death of the patient due to an irregular heart beat or kidney failure after the surgical procedure
7027515 proving the causative role of a new mutation enables researchers to include it in the list of mh mutations and makes the genetic test more reliable
7027516 this is an important step toward establishing an inexpensive and minimally invasive genetic test for diagnosing mh this new mutation should therefore be included in the current list of mh causing mutations
7027517 these rat model tumors were developed from human glioblastoma tumor cells and closely mimic human tumors in growth patterns and response to therapy
7027518 the concept of targeting blood vessels that feed tumors as an approach to limit tumor growth is not a novel idea
7027519 however blocking the specific fatty acid described in this study is novel and holds great promise for use in humans
7027520 if survival time could be extended with a combination of surgical therapy and infusion with similar drugs this could be a significant treatment option
7027521 these pumps have been used in humans for other diseases and can be designed for delivery of these drugs as well
7027522 we believe they can be used to deliver drugs to block angiogenesis in complex human tumors such as glioblastomas
7027523 our findings provide a basis for opening up new therapeutic approaches to protect neurons from inflammation and toxicity induced neurodegeneration
7027524 selective cox 2 inhibitors were thought to be a promising medicine in treating neurodegenerative diseases stroke cancers and inflammation related diseases like arthritis however the occurrence of a series of cardiovascular complications in patients receiving cox 2 inhibitors has led to their recent withdrawal from the market and limits on their usages our research has shown that the use of endogenous cannabinoid 2 ag may avoid such side effects therefore elevation of endogenous 2 ag levels by facilitating its production inhibiting its decomposition or directly supplying 2 ag may result in treatment advances to prevent the devastation of disorders like stroke alzheimers and traumatic brain injury
7027525 i think the china government has done a very good job of presenting a positive image overseas but in doing so it didnt change much of its behavior to do that
7027526 this was part of the grand plan to show a new china and i think its delivered in many regards
7027527 china is trying to present itself as nonthreatening and in a lot of ways nonsocialist
7027528 theyve gone all out to try and present a country thats ancient yet super modern
7027529 wants people to shift their responses beyond the man standing in front of the tank
7027530 i am impressed by the cosmopolitan atmosphere i didnt think it would be so urban and so advanced
7027531 the one thing the olympics has shown americans is that china has a very well developed and successful infrastructure and its easy to get around
7027532 its almost like theyve thrown the communist manifesto out of the window
7027533 war on terror to impose a new pax americana on eurasia and particularly in the unruly areas between the caucasus and the khyber pass appear to have gone up in flames in some cases literally over the past two weeks

7027541 nuclear weapon proliferation is the single most immediate threat hanging over the world today mr keating said
7027542 turned its hand to new bunker busting nuclear weapons designed to attack underground facilities
7027543 the plain fact is there can be no non proliferation without de proliferation
7027544 that is if the weapons states are not prepared to rid themselves of nuclear weapons why would other states continue to deny themselves the kind of leverage which these weapons bring
7027545 the old order of victorious powers with major powers hanging onto weapons of massive destruction is a remnant of the violent 20th century mr keating said
7027546 it cannot provide the basis for an equitable and effective system of world governance
7027547 just as world community concerns have been ahead of the political system on issues such as global warming so too world community concern needs to galvanise international action to find a new template for a lasting peace one embracing all the major powers and regions
7027548 this can be done but it requires leadership and imagination
7027549 we are following the development and if they are looking for a provocation we will know how to avoid it
7027550 i brought the kids so if they the activists arrive i can tell them welcome and thank you for not forgetting us
7027551 nobody thinks that these boats will break the siege in a practical way but this is a moral message what is happening in gaza is illegal and inhumane and must be halted
7027552 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7027553 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7027554 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7027555 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7027556 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7027557 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7027558 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

7027561 h uma pequena diferen a entre mclaren ferrari e as outras equipes ent o talvez todas elas tenham melhorado seus carros desde a ltima corrida
7027562 e agora a ferrari pode obter um bom tempo na primeira volta acho
7027563 ambos os compostos est o trabalhando razoavelmente e a diferen a entre os tempos de volta muito pequena pois o circuito estava muito muito sujo
7027564 fizeram um trabalho excelente um momento hist rico para a cidade e o p blico de val ncia o circuito tem um ambiente diferente e d a chance de viver a corrida muito de perto espero que a festa seja bonita e que n o aconte a nada fora do esperado para estrag la
7027565 eu segui alguns carros no treino e acho que existe uma possibilidade para ultrapassar mas ser dif cil o desenho da pista n o faz as coisas f ceis
7027566 depois das longas retas nas curvas 12 e 17 elas t m freadas fortes depois das partes de longa reta ent o elas s o uma oportunidade mas ainda dif cil voc poderia for ar uma na ltima curva se tiver sorte ou ent o na curva 2 mas n o seria f cil
7027567 acho que tem um talvez dois o fim da reta maior e os outros pontos s o mais complicados mas n o imposs veis
7027568 muito diferente do que pens vamos inicialmente com um f 1 a 250 km h na curva dif cil seguir os outros
7027569 se o gr mio ganhasse abriria oito pontos com certeza iria ficar mais dif cil mas continua na mesma o palmeiras tamb m perdeu isso foi bom motiva ainda mais a gente permanecer na mesma coloca o depois da rodada ent o pensar no t tulo e tirar esta distancia do l der que o gr mio
7027570 temos de ir em busca do resultado positivo de nos recuperar na competi o uma partida importante para a gente
7027571 futebol paulista sempre muito dif cil joga diferente do futebol mineiro do futebol carioca um futebol mais cadenciado mas o time que chega l e joga bem a torcida fica contra tem todos estes fatores que tem de levar em conta
7027572 tem de ir l e fazer um bom jogo e sair com a vit ria
7027573 quando jogam em casa que o caso da vila belmiro eles molham o campo e a bola fica mais r pida procuram sempre imprimir velocidade at porque o campo pequeno e favorece ao time deles

7027579 we need to re establish positions on cuba and in other countries
7027580 its impossible to imagine that anyone in the cuban leadership would want to put their country in the bulls eye of another superpower showdown reminiscent of the missile crisis
7027581 the military talk seems to be bluster on moscows part
7027582 cuba has nothing to gain from a military relationship which would be high risk and out of character with the steady renovation of diplomatic relationships
7027583 as ive heard dozens of times over the years from cubans on the island the bolos russians are not to be trusted
7027584 russia seeks to reassert itself as a world power which includes a renewed presence in while cuba wants to diversify its economic partners to reduce its dependence on venezuela

7027601 my view is that the buffer zones are against the spirit of the ceasefire agreement
7027602 why do they want to take control of poti they do not have such a right
7027603 maybe they want to grab poti from us while we are still alive we will not allow them to stay here if they were our friends they would not do this
7027604 should we sit behind the fence what use would we be then they georgian forces will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them

7027639 the opposition party has assured us before that there will not be any untoward situation during the agitation
7027640 we are going ahead with our indefinite agitation and we want it to be peaceful but if something goes out of gear its the state governments responsibility
7027641 dis is da erst class ectin inin it surr i went and sat with some dutch bikers heading to the isle of man grand prix the dutch still love the canadians
7027642 it is the first time in europe since the cold war that a foreign army has entered the territory of a sovereign state without any internationally accepted legal basis if we were to be ambivalent about this it would give tacit approval to put our country and our citizens under threat
7027643 ukraine has to move towards the nato alliance it is the only way for our country to protect our national security and sovereignty when the borders of nato expand so too does the region of peace and stability
7027644 we need to increase the military budget so that there is no question about what happens tomorrow

7027649 ik heb al duizend keer gedacht dat ik dood zou gaan tienduizend honderdduizend keer hoofdpijn betekent voor mij een hersentumor een steek op mijn borst een hartaanval dat ik nog steeds leef zou me gerust moeten stellen zou je denken maar als ik in paniek ben heb ik niets aan de gedachte dat er al die voorgaande keren niets ernstigs aan de hand was en het ook nu dus wel mee zal vallen iedere keer weer ben ik er volledig van overtuigd dat het ditmaal cht raak is pure doodsangst die me naar adem laat snakken er is een tijd geweest dat ik bijna dagelijks bij de dokter zat bij elk krampje of pijntje gingen alle alarmbellen af ik kon die angst alleen van me afzetten als de dokter mijn lichaam onderzocht die werd natuurlijk gek van me maar hij wist niet wat hij met me aan moest en deed maar gewoon wat ik vroeg als ik dan later weer thuis was schaamde ik me omdat ik er w r voor niets had gezeten maar als ik de volgende dag opnieuw iets meende te voelen pakte ik toch weer de telefoon en ik liet me niet afpoeieren als een tijger beet ik me erin vast ik ervoer het als een zaak van leven en dood zo kon het niet verder dus ben ik in therapie gegaan voor mijn maatkracht een hulpverleningsorganisatie waar ervaringsdeskundigen werken daar heb ik veel baat bij met behulp van ademhalingsoefeningen kan ik hevige paniekaanvallen voorkomen en daarmee is de sterkste doodsangst in toom te houden
7027650 just make sure that in the end you get to df lewis and read every damned thing he ever wrote before you die
7027651 favorite contemporary authors include df lewis brian evenson stepan chapman jeff vandermeer thomas ligotti jonathan carroll and steven millhauser
7027652 wrzesmian wasnt too popular the works of this strange man saturated with rampant fantasy and imbued with strong individualism gave a most unfavourable impression by inverting accepted aesthetic literary theories and by mocking established pseudo truths his output was eventually acknowledged as the product of a sick imagination the bizarre work of an eccentric maybe even a madman wrzesmian was an inconvenience for a variety of reasons and he disturbed unnecessarily stirring peaceful waters thus his premature eclipse was received with a secret sigh of relief
7027653 my pictures are visionary and symbolical and from first to last have seemed to be painted by someone other than myself i am thus entirely self taught or taught by that other within me i am aware that my pictures lack serious technique if there is a technique that can be distinguished from inspiration and invention i should have given up painting them some time ago were it not that a certain number of people seemed to find something remarkable in them and have thus identified me with them and made me feel mildly important
7027654 from the cosmic point of view to have opinions or preferences at all is to be ill for by harbouring them one dams up the flow of the ineluctable force which like a river bears us down to the ocean of everythings unknowing reality is a running noose one is brought up short with a jerk by death it would have been wiser to co operate wih the inevitable and learn to profit by this unhappy state of things by realising and accommodating death but we dont we allow the ego to foul its own nest therefore we have insecurity stress the midnight fruit of insomnia with a whole culture crying itself to sleep how to repair this state of affairs except through art through gifts which render to us language manumitted by emotion poetry twisted into the service of direct insight
7027655 id left the slippers and i guess thats why theyre called slippers
7027656 dont worry ill clear this up you go and see to yourself
7027657 we can sort all that out later but now we need to get you both to hospital whats your name and the ladys
7027658 well pete and judith you need to listen very carefully
7027659 sorry to have called you we shall heal we shall get better
7027660 he set the scene before anyone else had time to draw breath
7027661 we got 5 minutes id done everything right got a great hook the rational and id rehearsed in front of the mirror until i was word perfect and it was good i was passionate serious and engaging my subject was important real and relevant to everyone i asked the pertinent question why do 99 ice cream cornets cost 1 20 when they should cost 99p or be called 1 20s i then went on to ask other associated questions which involved the mismatching of names and monetary amounts it was the best theatrical performance of my life but horror of horrors id forgotten that it was time voyager night as well i realised at length that my audience was getting restless and low mumblings became loud protests many had travelled from different decades and some from different centuries it dawned on me that i was in the wrong time period for at least part of my audience no matter what id said i left the stage to the sound of jeers and confusion i had also broken the rules and had run out of time and so couldnt deliver my planned masterful finale it was humiliating
7027662 you ought to have seen the face of the chap who had come all the way from the sixteenth century when pete went on about the penny farthing bicycle he thought he was facing an argument in favour of transubstantiation and hadnt a clue what pete was on about it was the funniest thing id seen in a long time
7027663 well at least i know what transubstantiation means unlike you you moron
7027664 so lets hear your own embarrassing out of time moment this should be interesting
7027665 do you remember the time we were in spain twenty years ago i made a right fool of myself then talk about being out of time
7027666 spain you say tilting at windmills eh don quixote wasnt it a bit like fighting against giant clocks rather than wilndmills all is out of kilter in spain anyway bull fights being just an anachronistic echo of humanitys brutal past but do go on simon
7027667 i dont want to interrupt your holiday too long but there is something you need to know about the spanish
7027668 spanish time travel is not like our time travel no big jumps from decade to decade that our friend pete talks about in the white pelican no vast shifts between generations no star travellers leap frogging millennia spaniards just side step between minutes or even seconds there they are then they are gone then they are back some clutching guinea fowls others straddling a couple of sovereign states simultaneously yet others waving red capes spaniards need to shift real quick to dodge any bulls being out of time puts them in danger of being gored
7027669 ok then but its a bit boring i go to a line dancing group as you know
7027670 one night they were playing boot scooting boogie and i had just brought some nice new cowboy boots the problem was i was so busy admiring them that i forgot to do the kick ball change step and mavis tripped over me crashing to the floor she had to sit out for the rest of it i felt awfully guilty as it wasnt long ago that she had a hip replacement
7027671 anyway i was in all of a flutter after that and completely out of time for the rest of the evening talk about stomping in the wrong direction mavis wasnt the only casualty
7027672 like you went it happened when you were a lot younger
7027673 both i was actually 19 and i went back to the mid sixties
7027674 what about the wars they had lots of wars then i know ive studied that century there were two world wars a fleet name thingy two break no gulf wars and oh it was awful
7027675 1967 was called the summer of love and if it wasnt for the people then this world would be a far worse place they changed the world in the twentieth century
7027676 i wanna know what happened why dont you two give your mouths a rest and let nathan excercise his specially you sylvia you wanted to know or was that so you didnt have to explain your out of time any more
7027677 well it was in a country called america and i got involved in some sort of youth movement
7027678 no there was a lot of political revolution coming from the youth
7027679 it was just well no one knew they were changing things it was after those two big wars you spoke of but before vietnam i think anyway the young people started taking over the music world and all sorts of things were said and protested over you had to be there to understand
7027680 well it happened when i went to this big music festival called woodstock
7027681 i know all about that some farmers field in rural america hosted loads of the top musicians of the day and four businessmen arranged what turned out to be the biggest musical event of the century you or me
7027682 woodstock was one of the major events of the 20th century certainly in the music world i think most of us who were there recognised that even then it was a turning point a point where it became obvious that a quarter of a million people could live in harmony for three days at least
7027683 id only just arrived there and unlike pete i hadnt studied the century
7027684 thats why you didnt know that america entered the vietnam war in 1965
7027685 no youre right pete i didnt although come to think of it that makes sense given some of the music that was played at woodstock especially country joe mcdonald
7027686 anyway i digress the thing is i didnt know how to act or anything my clothes were all wrong although the crowd was so friendly nobody took the piss or anything in fact the guy standing next to me turned to me looked me up and down took a cylindrical straw shaped thing from his mouth and handed it to me look like you could do with this man he said i took it from him noted lots of them had got similar things in their mouths and thought it was something to eat so i put it in my mouth
7027687 no they were very kind one of them gave me a drink in a can and that cooled my mouth then they gave me another of those cylindrical things and i watched what they did with them and copied them in no time at all my mouth had stopped hurting well at least i think it did i really dont remember much until i got back here
7027688 they say that if you can remember the sixties then you werent really part of it so presumably if you cant remember them then you were there

7027692 if i choose to follow proven procedures effective for a large number of people over lengthy periods of time and i do these procedures every day or several times every day is that more likely to help me than the 1 2 or 3 hours week that most other treatment modalities require of their patients

7027709 its not about our fear its about the people waiting in gaza you cant think about anything else
7027710 israel has an obligation towards the palestinian people being the occupying power
7027711 gaza has a collapsed economy it is seriously deprived dependent on charity unemployment is very high the place is desparate the people are desparate because this is really a kind of prison

7027726 obama is a weak candidate so he had to pick an experienced running mate joe biden to make up for his lack of qualification
7027727 obama picked biden hes lying when he says he wants to be president because he is an outsider biden is a bigtime insider hypocrite
7027728 obama is associated with weather underground radical ayers so he agrees with ayers
7027729 mccain doesnt know how many homes he has hes so rich whos the elitist
7027730 in de tweede en derde ronde heb ik me wat opgeblazen en ik ben nooit meer echt gerecupereerd
7027731 goed dat ik toch nog een bepaald tempo kon aanhouden want anders zou het helemaal slecht geweest zijn als je je helemaal opblaast en je kan zelfs geen klim meer op dan is de wedstrijd voorbij de wedstrijd verliep heel snel als je even een beetje minder hard reed verloor je meteen vijf of zes plaatsen op het einde van de eerste ronde heb ik de kop genomen omdat ik me heel goed voelde ik vond het beter om helemaal vooraan te beginnen aan de technische afdaling daarmee heb ik geen krachten verloren integendeel natuurlijk ben ik ontgoocheld maar het leven en de koers gaat verder ik heb gewoon pech dat het op de spelen iedere keer een dergelijk parcours is maar over vier jaar rijd ik opnieuw mee voor mijn vijfde spelen
7027732 ik bedank barcelona omdat ze me zo goed behandeld hebben en me de toestemming hebben gegeven om naar hier te komen
7027733 ik wil ook mijn coach pep guardiola bedanken hij stelde een heel mooi gebaar en nu kunnen we met elkaar spreken van olympisch kampioen tot olympisch kampioen
7027734 ik heb hier hele goeie vrienden gemaakt en de ervaring om enkele dagen in het olympisch dorp te leven tussen al die grote sportmannen was ook erg mooi

7027738 at the time that i was going to catholic school and living in my parents home there was a perfect fit between the theology of the church and the philosophy of my parents
7027739 if you ever speak to my son like that again ill come back and rip that bonnet off your head
7027740 i told him wait until you start dating girls then go
7027741 my mother thought i had to experience life first and she was right
7027742 i was raised at a time when the catholic church was fertile with new ideas and open discussion about some of the basic social teaching of the catholic church

7027749 nuclear weapon proliferation is the single most immediate threat hanging over the world today mr keating said
7027750 turned its hand to new bunker busting nuclear weapons designed to attack underground facilities
7027751 the plain fact is there can be no non proliferation without de proliferation
7027752 that is if the weapons states are not prepared to rid themselves of nuclear weapons why would other states continue to deny themselves the kind of leverage which these weapons bring
7027753 the old order of victorious powers with major powers hanging onto weapons of massive destruction is a remnant of the violent 20th century mr keating said
7027754 it cannot provide the basis for an equitable and effective system of world governance
7027755 just as world community concerns have been ahead of the political system on issues such as global warming so too world community concern needs to galvanise international action to find a new template for a lasting peace one embracing all the major powers and regions
7027756 this can be done but it requires leadership and imagination

7027761 our study shows that if you have a dense rigid matrix the cells will be more aggressive and invasive its a direct effect
7027762 if you have enough invadopodia over time theyll make large holes that cells can move through to invade and metastasize
7027763 we thought that more stuff for the cells to get through was going to make it harder so we expected to see less matrix degradation but instead we found this interesting effect where cells actually sense the rigidity and degrade more
7027764 the idea that tissue rigidity leads to a more aggressive phenotype had been out there for a while but it hadnt actually been tied to matrix degradation which is thought to be important for metastasis and spread of cells through the body

7027780 i think the china government has done a very good job of presenting a positive image overseas but in doing so it didnt change much of its behavior to do that
7027781 this was part of the grand plan to show a new china and i think its delivered in many regards
7027782 china is trying to present itself as nonthreatening and in a lot of ways nonsocialist
7027783 theyve gone all out to try and present a country thats ancient yet super modern

7027807 as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex
7027808 it is significant in the sense that there was semtex in the explosive charge it did not go off but there was semtex there where it came from i dont know
7027809 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups
7027810 weve had attempted murders in londonderry and dungannon and spamount and now lisnaskea

7028115 barack obama has re opened a wound among american catholics by picking a pro abortion catholic politician
7028116 the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7028117 i am a long standing supporter of roe v wade and a womans right to choose
7028118 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7028119 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7028120 i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7028121 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter objectively according to the constant teaching of the scriptures and the church it would be more spiritually beneficial for such a person to refrain from receiving the body and blood of christ i ask catholics in this position to have the integrity to respect the eucharist catholic teaching and the catholic faithful
7028122 the american bishops have instructed catholic voters to consider many issues but have characterized the defense of human life as foundational and have explained that the issue has a special claim on the conscience of the catholic voter this means that a political candidate like biden because of his strong support for abortion rights forfeits any claim for support despite his views on other issues like health care and the economy

7028137 we know personal information is too easily accessible by the criminal element and facebook is one of those areas people post personal information
7028138 we know the criminal element is going to this information to build a portfolio an identity profile and perpetrate crime

7028162 i notice a lot more kids wearing obama t shirts
7028163 i would say its a pretty big trend across the nation and at the university of florida
7028164 in many ways the young people mirror what is happening to the electorate as a whole
7028165 i think its irresponsible of the scientific community to just turn their nose up at this because of its past association as a tabloid subject
7028166 and i dont mean somebody with crude carved wooden feet strapped to their boots tromping around in the mud
7028167 there just arent that many people out there with the understanding of the subtleties of anatomy and kinematics of the human foot
7028168 its not a matter of well if we if the government just turned the satellite to look for it wed be able to pick it out
7028169 if youre coming to chicago be sure to wear some armor in your hair
7028170 we were used to the idea that authorities would stall on permits but i think some of us thought that the permits would come through at the end so we went forward
7028171 when the week started there were only 600 or 700 people in the park
7028172 it grew to about 10 000 nearly all of them from chicago
7028173 next thing we knew we were being kicked being pulled apart and some very racial statements being made and then i looked up and when i looked up thats when i got hit i still have the scar right here
7028174 i remember feeling that warm wet stuff on my face and i was bleeding
7028175 we were talking while we were on our way there about the assassination of robert kennedy the assassination of martin luther king jr we talked about the vietnam war
7028176 we just felt nobody was listening to us at that time anyway and we wanted to just have our say or at least be part of something
7028177 now theyre moving in the cops are moving and they are really belting these characters theyre grabbing them sticks are flailing people are laying on the ground i can see them colored people cops are just belting them cops are just laying it in theres piles of bodies on the street theres no question about it you can hear the screams and theres a guy theyre just dragging along the street and they dont care i dont think i dont know if hes alive or dead holy jesus look at him five of them are belting him really oh this man will never get up
7028178 the reason were protesting is because mr obamas reputation as a progressive is not really deserved
7028179 for example his so called anti war stance involves a program to remove combat troops from iraq over a period of 16 months the majority of american people want those troops removed immediately as soon as possible
7028180 people can go and come as they like the other thing that we are doing in the demonstration zone is to provide a stage and speakers and microphone so that they can be heard at a greater distance
7028181 and thats the citys role finding a balance between safety and security and the rights of those who would come and want to raise their voices
7028182 i dont mean to exaggerate but it is the end of freedom this is the freedom to protest as designed for you by any authoritarian state under the direction of the police
7028183 what 1968 demonstrated was that protest could be an effective tactic for bringing about social change
7028184 so important new protest tactics were invented the sit in the large demonstration and people learned that this was a way they could effectively influence the government
7028185 a large percentage of those delegates have people out there who are rallying or protesting issues that they care about
7028186 and as a matter of fact as a delegate i might get out there myself
7028187 well anyone that has seen tito puente live can attest to the fact that he was the most exciting live performer on the planet
7028188 tito puente is one of the most important musicians in any genre in the 20th century
7028189 i would put him up there with stravinsky leonard bernstein jimi hendrix etc etc not only was he an incredible percussionist but he was a fabulous composer and arranger i dont think people realize the depth of this mans musicianship
7028190 the drummer is usually in the back of a big band but what tito did with his orchestra is he put the percussion up front
7028191 the conga the bongo and himself on the timbales in the front now that served a dual purpose he could cue the orchestra and it also served as a symbol too that he was the leader of the band to the audience and he was the law as it was concerned
7028192 very funny story once he was warming up and he didnt know the microphone was on
7028193 and he started playing general quarters which means go to your battle stations just to warm up
7028194 i think titos juilliard training comes out in all of the things that he did
7028195 this is a great example of his knowledge of afro cuban rhythm and his knowledge of the orchestra
7028196 a promoter kind of gave him that name to sort of cross over into the so called anglo american market
7028197 well anyone that has seen him live can attest to the fact that he was the most exciting live performer on the planet
7028198 in afro cuban music weve inherited this concept of being possessed by the music on the dance floor
7028199 im not saying its better than sex but its close to it
7028200 they were the first band to successfully use the complex and rich harmonic style of jazz arranging technique and also featured great virtuosic jazz improvisers with authentic afro cuban rhythms that we inherited from west africa and crystallized into new forms on the island of cuba
7028201 this was an example of the great musical and cultural interchange that was happening at the time between the jazz community and the latino community in new york city and still exists to this day

7028224 the nist team found no evidence that explosives were involved in the collapse
7028225 nist did not test for the presence of explosive residue and such tests would not necessarily have been conclusive
7028226 our analysis shows that even the smallest explosive charge that was capable of bringing down the critical column in the building had it occurred we would have seen sound levels of 120 to 130 dbs a half a mile away that could have been an incredibly loud sound and that sound was not picked up by any of the videos or the witnesses we have talked to

7028257 the president has made it clear several times until now america was russias advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community
7028258 we included russia in the group of eight g8 leading industrialized nations we welcomed and pushed forward russias desire to join the world trade organization that is all at risk now
7028259 one of the chief methods by which this groups works has been through propaganda it plotted the jameson raid of 1895 it caused the boer war of 1899 1902 it set and controls rhodes trust it created the union of south africa in 1906 1910 it established the south african periodical the state in 1908
7028260 lionel curtis is one of the most important members of the milner groups or as a member of the group expressed it to me he is the fons et origo it may sound extravangant as a statement but a powerful defense could be made of the claim that what curtis thinks should be done to the british empire is what happens a generation late i shall give here only two recent examples of this in 1911 curtis decided that the name of his majestys dominions must be changed from british empire to commonwealth of nations this as done officially in 1948 again about 1911 curtis decided that india must be given complete self government as rapidly as conditions permitted this was carried out in 1947 as we shall see these are merely coincidental events for curtis working behind the scenes has been one of the chief architects of the present commonwealth
7028261 the vatican has large investments with the rothschilds of britain france and america with the hambros bank and with the credit suisse in london and zurich in the united states it has large investments with the morgan bank the chase manhattan bank the first national bank of new york the bankers trust company and others the vatican has billions in shares in the most powerful international corporations such as gulf oil shell general motors bethlehem steel general electric international business machines ibm t w a etc at a conservative estimate these amount to more than 500 million dollars in the usa alone in a statement published in connection with a bond prospectus the boston archdiocese listed its assets at six hundred and thirty five million 635 891 004 which is 9 9 times its liabilities this leaves a net worth of five hundred and seventy one million dollars 571 704 953 it is not difficult to discover the truly astonishing wealth of the roman catholic church once we add the riches of the twenty eight archdioceses and 122 dioceses of the usa some of which are even wealthier than that of boston some idea of the real estate and other forms of wealth controlled by the roman catholic church may be gathered by the remark of a member of the new york catholic conference namely that his church probably ranks second only to the united states government in total annual purchase another statement made by a nationally syndicated catholic priest perhaps is even more telling the catholic church he said must be the biggest corporation in the united states we have a branch office in every neighborhood our assets and real estate holdings must exceed those of standard oil a t amp t and u s steel combined and our roster of dues paying members must be second only to the tax rolls of the united states government the roman catholic church once all her assets have been put together is the most formidable stockbroker in the world the wall street journal said that the vaticans financial deals in the u s alone were so big that very often it sold or bought gold in lots of a million or more dollars at one time the vaticans treasure of solid gold has been estimated by the united nations world magazine to amount to several billion dollars but this is just a small portion of the wealth of the vatican which in the u s alone is greater than that of the five wealthiest giant corporations of the country when to that is added all the real estate property stocks and shares abroad then the staggering accumulation of the wealth of the roman catholic church becomes so formidable as to defy any rational assessment the catholic church is the biggest financial power wealth accumulator and property owner in existence she is a greater possessor of material riches than any other single institution corporation bank giant trust government or state of the whole globe the pope is consequently the richest individual of the twentieth century
7028262 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7028263 jewish sovereignty in the land of israel extended over 1400 years it was the jews who implanted the culture and customs of the permanent settlement
7028264 because they did not want too many of them in new york
7028265 millions of jews are dust on the wheels of history that will have to be blown away they must accept their fate we do not want them crowding into our tel aviv turning it into a low grade ghetto
7028266 the call by the arab governments to the inhabitants of palestine to evacuate it and to leave for the bordering arab countries after having sown terror among them since 1948 we have been demanding the return of the refugees to their homes but we ourselves are the ones who encouraged them to leave we have brought destruction upon a million arab refugees by calling upon them and pleading with them to leave their land their homes their work and business
7028267 all truly dogmatic religions have issued from the kabalah and return to it everything scientific and grand in the religious dreams of the illuminati jaco boeheme swedenborg saint martin and others is borrowed from the kabalah all masonic associations owe it their secrets and their symbols masonry is a search after light that search leads us back as you see to the kabalah in that ancient and little understood source book the initiate will find the source of many doctrines and he may in time come to understand the hermetic philosophers the alchemists all the antipapal thinkers of the middle ages and emanuel swedenborg
7028268 of all the objects which constitute the masonic science of symbolism the most important the most cherished by the mason and by far the most significant is the temple of jerusalem
7028269 by albert mackey md 33 and charles t mcclenachan 33 revised edition by edward l hawkins 30 and william j hughan 32 volume ii m z published by the masonic history company chicago new york london 1873 a g mackey 1927 by the masonic history company
7028270 in the high grades of masonry we hear of a secret intention to build yet another temple at jerusalem
7028271 a new encyclopedia of freemasonry and of cognate instituted mysteries the rites literature and history
7028272 the freemasons have at all events seized with avidity the idea of representing in their symbolic language the interior and spiritual man by a material temple the great body of the masonic craft looking only to this first temple erected by the wisdom of king solomon make it the symbol of life and as the great object of masonry is the search after truth they are directed to build up this temple as a fitting receptacle for truth
7028273 we are supporting pakistan the event must be in pakistan i don t think we will change our stance at the moment i don t think the indian board will change its view in the present circumstances
7028274 i don t think it will be divided i think there will be a solution on this
7028275 the rebuilding of the temple is at the center of our studies
7028276 michael hammer at the university of arizona in tucson and colleagues some from israeli universities analyzed 18 sections of the y chromosomes from 1371 men they came from 29 different populations including seven jewish ashkenazi european roman north african kurdish iraqi and iranian yemenite and ethiopian jews five arabic palestinians lebanese syrians israeli druze and saudis and 16 non semitic groups the close similarities within the jewish y chromosomes even from widely scattered populations was compelling evidence that they all come from a common ancestor the study also showed that arabs are closely related to jews the hungarian born jewish author arthur koestler 1905 1973 theorised that todays ashkenazi jews are really descendants of the khazars who allegedly converted en masse in the eighth century in what is today modern russia however koestler was prone to anti establishmentarianism and this khazar conversion theory could have been motivated by his desire as a secularised jew to assimilate with gentiles and avoid persecution the idea has been widely discredited by reputable historians because the real history of the jewish people is far too well documented to sustain such an idea they point out that the theory presupposes lots of gentiles assimilating into jewish society the exact opposite of what normally happens where jew gentile intermarriage occurs in reality only a tiny number of khazars converted to judaism while far more converted to islam and also some to russian orthodoxy the khazar converts to judaism had disappeared by the 14th century largely by being incorporated into already existing jewish communities in poland there is also a problem of what happened to the real jews who are supposed to have mass evangelised the khazars then disappeared without trace out of history many anti semites quote koestler as though he were verbally inspired thus damning the jews because they supposedly arent real jews whereas the nazis and those who absurdly called jews christ killers damned them because they were real jews the studies by hammer et al shows that the ashkenazi jews really are the same people group as the other jews and that there is a common ancestry for the cohanim from ashkenazi and sephardic jews so are the last nails in the coffin for koestlers idea
7028277 for you are a people set apart as holy for adonai your god adonai your god has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his own unique treasure 7 adonai didnt set his heart on you or choose you because you numbered more than any other people on the contrary you were the fewest of all peoples 8 rather it was because adonai loved you and because he wanted to keep the oath which he had sworn to your ancestors that adonai brought you out with a strong hand and redeemed you from a life of slavery under the hand of pharoah king of egypt
7028278 i say then hath god cast away his people god forbid for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin 11 2 god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew
7028279 the other gospel of john hagee christian zionism and ethnic salvation
7028280 the moslem religious leader the mufti was openly friendly throughout arabia the chiefs were for the most part distinctly pro zionist and in palestine the peasantry was delighted at every prospect of jewish settlement near their villages commercial intercourse between arab and jew was constant and steady
7028281 brethren my hearts desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved
7028282 god is no respecter of persons before him the holy one men stand not as jews and gentiles but as sinners who are in need of grace jesus the prophet may be speaking to the gentiles but jesus the son of god speaks to mankind jesus the martyr may be appealing to some and not to others but jesus the lamb of god challenges the whole human race gods word is one word and gods way is one if it is the way of god
7028283 it is not a form of religious persecution to say and to show that another religion is false for an informed person to expose publicly a certain religion on being false thus allowing persons to see the difference between false religion and true religion
7028284 the cross and crown may be said to be confined almost exclusively to the historical degrees in masonry as exemplified in the various orders of knighthood of york and scottish rites in gaul we find the cross to have been a solar symbol when it had equal arms and angles to the phoenicians it was an instrument of sacrifice to their god baal and to the egyptians the crux ansata was his symbol of eternal life
7028285 horus commanded thoth that the winged sun disk with uraei should be brought into every sanctuary wherein he dwelt and into every sanctuary of all the gods of the lands of the south and the north and in amentet in order that they might drive away evil from therein
7028286 the winged globe is pre eminently a rosicrucian symbol although the illuminati may lay claim to it and it may be admitted that it is of egyptian origin the winged globe is the symbol of the perfected soul making its flight back to the source of its creation in the elysian fields beyond

7028298 its a fine morning for a ride or it would be if the land wasnt marked like this
7028299 all morning weve been riding and all weve seen is charred earth tumbled fences battered walls the towns that way youll find people who can tell it better
7028300 i am sir brandon i hail from parts north this is sir lamarcus from the south and east
7028301 if youre from the north and you from the south and east how did you end up traveling together
7028302 ive been around long enough to know that fortunate drafts are seldom the result of mere chance
7028303 however that may be chance is how we see it if you see something else perhaps you are wiser
7028304 i shouldnt have probably should have left with all the rest but i figure i had my best years tilling this ground didnt find much of a home anywhere else most of them are in town its that way if you remember
7028305 i suppose ill just knock back as many as i can before they bowl me over or until they stop coming
7028306 if everybody here is like you i think we might take a liking to this land as well
7028307 i dont supposed trained is what youd call it there are a couple of youngsters who have been fooling around for a while i wouldnt give them much chance in a real fight though
7028308 i wonder if theres any chance of getting something decent to eat here
7028309 i would stop right there if you mean this town any harm
7028310 my friend there knows how to use his weapon and mine would fell you before you drew that sword at your side
7028311 yes a farmer outside of town said we might find youths in here who had some skill with weapons
7028312 you have enough quickness and ive never seen leaps like you perform but the gods only know how youve managed to get this far without slicing off your own feet the way you wave that thing around when you tumble
7028313 yes i believe so with a little proper training he may be more than that
7028314 i can see long distance shooting will be your specialty under the tutelage of the two knights the young men learned something of the ways of battle dont waste motion but there when you see an opening take it take it
7028315 well i have to say that you look pretty impressive it was more than i thought you would do but theres still a problem i dont think all the practice in the world is going to get you around
7028316 ah obviously fine men in impeccable shape you surely do not have need of my potions and curatives the miracles i carry can make you as fit and strong as these and then some a little perseverance and a spoonful of belief is all it takes but you three you would certainly be more interested in my pastimes riddles to confound the mind and puzzles to confound the fingers and common sense alike games that your children will never tire of and smells that your wives will love no well perhaps you enjoy juggling then
7028317 then perhaps we can discuss this under more private circumstances
7028318 gentlemen surely my welcome can not be as worn as all that yet
7028319 no not at all you simply find us at a difficult time the campaigning season is soon upon us and we havent enough men to properly defend this town a little levity would be useful to take the peoples minds off of their troubles but a good sword would be even more useful
7028320 well now i have told you i am a buffet of goodness have i not
7028321 what is your price to join us we have not had good fortune with hired hands
7028322 price not all the money in the world would do i fear i can make all the money i need plying my trade
7028323 i cannot believe that you are thinking of accepting this man into our fine fellowship
7028324 i am sergio sometimes known as il mago i have great and wonderful powers unlike this charlatan and purveyor of trinkets
7028325 not that i should have to prove myself to you but yes
7028326 perhaps we can use him in some kind of support role
7028327 we have reached our decision since the matter of which of you is the greater is as yet unsettled we are forced to retain both of you in our company let no man say different until we ourselves have made our judgment
7028328 even with our company so strengthened we lack two things
7028329 there used to be a man like that around here wide
7028330 god is liefde wie in de liefde woont woont in god en god is met hem
7028331 wij hebben liefde leren kennen die god voor ons heeft en wij geloven in haar wij geloven in liefde
7028332 i told the guys that if we didnt win a medal i was just going to stay here
7028333 there are a lot of good teams here and theres a chance that if you dont play good ball every day youre not going to come out of here with a medal
7028334 he wasnt locating his pitches like he likes to and he gave up a couple of home runs
7028335 but he settled down and he really won the game for us he was dominant after the second home run
7028336 we had guys on base all day we just had to have somebody step up
7028337 it seemed like it was a lifetime from the sixth inning on
7028338 it would do good for baseball like every sport to have the stars
7028339 we have lebron james in basketball we had michael jordan scottie pippen and magic johnson on the dream team
7028340 that trend has continued in basketball and we have all the stars of the nhl so we would love to have as many stars of the major leagues as possible id love to see alex rodriguez
7028341 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate

7028351 aug 23 7 49 am edt obama taps biden to be running mate by liz sidoti and nedra pickler associated press writers
7028352 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7028353 its a very american very middle class phenomenon the way we were raised is that it was bad taste to talk about how much you make
7028354 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7028355 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago
7028356 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone
7028357 we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7028358 cet accident terrible provoque chez nous bien entendu la consternation et une immense peine
7028359 je voudrais dire au nom de tous les marseillais aux familles de ceux qui viennent de dispara tre et de ceux qui sont bless s que nous partageons leur douleur
7028360 oh he he wasnt hurt as badly as we were led to believe
7028361 this will really help us under the cap if we say
7028362 we really hope he doesnt sign anywhere else because that would hurt us
7028363 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
7028364 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
7028365 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
7028366 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
7028367 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
7028368 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
7028369 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
7028370 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
7028371 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
7028372 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
7028373 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
7028374 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
7028375 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write
7028376 instead of focusing on the burn victims the nurses kept repeating you drove them here
7028377 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7028378 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7028379 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7028380 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7028381 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7028382 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7028383 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7028384 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7028385 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7028386 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7028387 gives a new perspective on the english civil war through the eyes of angelica fanshawe riseborough who is drawn to the anti monarchist cause at a time when england executed its king in favor of an alternative form of government
7028388 considering the british traditions of free speech and the individual and the british suspicion of organized crowds we would want to avoid the leni riefenstahl connotations which were there in beijing and the ceremony was too long
7028389 i never want to be pigeon holed im an entertainer whether im entertaining a teenage girl whos watching me judging on a tv show a young guy watching doctor who or a couple watching torchwood the fact i can diversify is great
7028390 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7028391 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7028392 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7028393 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7028394 follow the perfidious operation where a number of young mujahedeen have been killed
7028395 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7028396 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7028397 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7028398 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7028399 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7028400 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7028401 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7028402 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7028403 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7028404 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7028405 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7028406 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7028407 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7028408 lawrence underwent the exploratory arthroscopic procedure which revealed no structural damage at this point lawrence will continue to treat the soreness in his knee through a rehabilitation program
7028409 j i packer once told me our view of god is like a pair of old fashioned scales when god goes up in our estimation we go down similarly when we raise our sense of self importance our view of god must to the same degree be lowered
7028410 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7028411 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7028412 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7028413 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7028414 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7028415 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7028416 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7028417 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7028418 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7028419 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7028420 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7028421 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7028422 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7028423 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7028424 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7028425 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7028426 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7028427 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7028428 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7028429 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7028430 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7028431 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7028432 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7028433 soy una expresi n de rebeld a ante la arrogancia de la ultra derecha aqu
7028434 ellos suponen que al llegar aqu llegu a este pa s hace ocho a os nos debemos someter a su discurso bueno yo me sal del redil
7028435 si s lo uno de los tres representantes federales cubanoestadunidenses de miami pierde empieza otra fase donde se acaba el monopolio sobre c mo se piensa aqu y se empieza a desmantelar todo el aparato de poder incluso el uso de fondos p blicos y los negocios que implica todo eso
7028436 cuando yo descubro la ultraderecha de miami veo terroristas individuos que han servido a las peores causas de am rica latina como a los pinochet los somoza los stroessner
7028437 yo s voy a defender la soberan a de cuba de ese pueblo la reunificaci n de las familias y contra estos que piden muerte para los cubanos la invasi n de cuba practican el terrorismo aqu y en cuba son salvajes
7028438 la derecha en miami est en un curso de choque con la realidad
7028439 mayor a de la comunidad cubana favorece la normalizaci n de las relaciones con la isla
7028440 les cost tanto en sus relaciones con washington como en su imagen aqu
7028441 aqu viv an convencidos de que cuba no segu a sin fidel pero fueron obligados a ser testigos de que cuba no se va a desmoronar y por lo tanto la tesis que formaba el eje del argumento aqu no funciona
7028442 miami permanece como algo parecido a una dictadura como una rep blica bananera no hay democracia real pareciera que nosotros los cubanos no entendemos bien eso de la democracia no es parte de nuestra historia o cultura y los migrantes cubanos particularmente los que viven en miami aparentemente no han logrado captar el concepto
7028443 escuchar lo de cuba en nuestra comunidad es como escuchar m sica vieja son cosas de tus abuelos o tus padres es como escuchar a elvis
7028444 la percepci n que yo tengo de cuba es de los cuentos de mi abuela de los 50 entonces al hablar con los m s reci n llegados es hablar de dos pa ses completamente diferentes
7028445 lesiona la voluntad de los vascos y la ley de asociaci n pol tica
7028446 lesiona la voluntad mayoritaria de los vascos obvia la ley de asociaci n pol tica y causa una manifiesta indefensi n
7028447 el responsable de la decisi n del constitucional tiene nombres y apellidos y es el se or jos luis rodr guez zapatero
7028448 ha provocado la suspensi n de la ley de consulta
7028449 queda cada vez m s claro agreg que se est utilizando el tc como un instrumento de poder del ejecutivo espa ol como el brazo judicial que impide o cierra las puertas a lo que ten a que haber sido una relaci n basada en el di logo entre instituciones o representantes pol ticos
7028450 negando y cerrando las puertas al di logo hace uso de instrumentos en este caso el constitucional que rechaza la personaci n de los partidos pol ticos ante la cuesti n de inconstitucionalidad de la ley de consulta
7028451 voluntad de la sociedad vasca que mayoritariamente ha aprobado una ley
7028452 provoca la mayor de las indefensiones que puede tener un partido pol tico dentro de un sistema denominado democr tico
7028453 entendemos que los partidos pol ticos s tenemos legitimaci n para personarnos ante este recurso de inconstitucionalidad presentado contra la ley de consulta y en definitiva se est vulnerando directamente el principio democr tico
7028454 o cualquier otro del mbito nacional catal n gallego o cualquier otra parte de la pen nsula o de las islas
7028455 si se sit a en la barrera de los 50 diputados
7028456 parece critic que el sistema constitucional est concebido para que los dos partidos grandes puedan actuar tambi n ante el constitucional
7028457 cerrar todo eso que se denomina causas que afectan al hecho pol tico vasco
7028458 tanto las ilegalizaciones como el de la inconstitucionalidad de la consulta parece que quieren resolver antes de iniciar el nuevo a o judicial
7028459 los problemas se agravan y las v as hacia europa
7028460 en las pr ximas semanas y meses estudiaremos las iniciativas que tanto las instituciones como los partidos pol ticos que hemos actuado de com n acuerdo ante el tc podamos adoptar

7028465 discernment is not created in gods people by brokenness humility reverence and repentance
7028466 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7028467 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7028468 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7028469 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7028470 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7028471 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7028472 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7028473 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7028474 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7028475 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7028476 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7028477 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7028478 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7028479 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7028480 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7028481 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7028482 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7028483 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7028484 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7028485 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7028486 who are open to doing something on the production side
7028487 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7028488 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7028489 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7028490 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7028491 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7028492 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7028493 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7028494 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7028495 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

7028507 antes de estudiar las obras del presidente mao lo nico que me importaba era lo que me pertenec a yo sab a precisamente cu ntos montones del esti rcol del yak ten a en casa sab a incluso cu ntos estaban secos y cu ntos no sin mirar pero no me importaban tanto los animales de la colectiva las ense anzas del presidente mao me agrandaron los horizontes ahora el prop sito de mi vida lo tengo claro hoy me preocupo no solo por la colectiva sino por todo el mundo y la revoluci n mundial

7028538 beyond his speeches how much do you know about barack obama what does he really believe consider this united 93 never hit the capitol on 9 11 but the capitol was bombed 30 years before by an american terrorist group called weather underground that declared war on the u s targeting the capitol the pentagon police stations and more one of the groups leaders william ayers admits to the bombings proudly saying later we didnt do enough some members of the group ayers founded even went on to kill police but barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as respectable and mainstream obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama american issues project is responsible for the content of this ad

7028542 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7028543 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7028544 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7028545 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7028546 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7028547 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

7028615 va quedando claro que la paciencia de nuestra gente tiene un l mite esta semana cuando se hicieron varios tractorazos se marc la urgencia de definiciones
7028616 es necesario que el gobierno convoque a reuniones pero tambi n tiene que aparecer una clara voluntad de escuchar el reclamo de miles de productores que piden una nueva pol tica para el sector
7028617 en el caso del trigo por ejemplo se ampli el volumen para exportar cuando todo el cereal est en manos de las multinacionales que venden al mercado externo esto no modifica el precio que se paga por la materia prima

7028631 the cia was running a joint venture with saudi intelligence

7028645 the cia may have subcontracted to mossad given that the agency was both prohibited by law from conducting intelligence operations on u s soil and lacked a pool of competent arabic fluent field officers in such a scenario the cia would either have worked actively with the israelis or quietly abetted an independent operation on u s soil when in the spring of 2002 the scenario of cias domestic subcontracting to foreign intelligence was posed to the veteran cia nsa intelligence operative with whom i spoke extensively the operative didnt reject it out of hand

7028742 the level of the referees and judges must be upgraded
7028743 we have no doubt the refereeing and judging is clean honest and transparent but we need higher standards
7028744 the level of judging and refereeing may not have reached what we had expected
7028745 we also believe we need to bring younger referees and judges to the olympics
7028746 we need to improve it and are currently working on a new more sophisticated prototype
7028747 our rules and measures mean there is no way you can manipulate the referees and judges

7028753 i dont want to lose a game of ping pong let alone a dancing competition he punched back
7028754 its not physically hard but im using different muscles that i am not used to using and its a very technical sport green said
7028755 its well and truly the opposite of what im used to doing when i fight or train my whole career has been about having to be a tough guy
7028756 to get where i have got and to win all the time you have got to be physically very very resilient and mentally extremely durable
7028757 you have to try to keep the game face on and show no emotion as a fighter you have got to be totally cold and void of emotion and you cant show your opponent anything
7028758 with dancing its the total opposite i have got to try to show myself and come out of my shell
7028759 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
7028760 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
7028761 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7028762 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7028763 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

7028783 we issued a subpoena in the official newspaper but he didnt attend the court proceedings no one representing him did either

7028786 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet
7028787 the power pack for your laptop isnt that efficient its one of those things thats almost too good to be true
7028788 for me its like a confirmation that its so exciting its something people would like to have
7028789 now the question is if its feasible or not its exciting that theyre also inspired and it seems closer to reality every day
7028790 she knew early on that i had virtually not much in common with the rockefeller family
7028791 referred to me as having been descended from john d rockefeller and such whenever it was to her advantage
7028792 it was given to me by the one person to whom ive always looked up to one person whom ive known since i was small
7028793 she usually did so in an understated way calling special attention to it by keeping it extra quiet
7028794 sort of psst shes married to a rockefeller its like saying you went to harvard it opens doors
7028795 many of her colleagues believed that it had a lot to do with me and my name
7028796 between the two of us i dont think it ever came up specifically as to like you know lets look up in the family tree but she knew early on that i had virtually not much in common with the rockefeller family
7028797 from what ive heard lately it might not be but as far as i know its my name
7028798 perhaps at some point we can do a dna test to really find out
7028799 im quite sure i grew up in new york city
7028800 i cant predict the future but i do think about my little girl every day every moment im awake the moment i go to sleep i think of her the moment i wake up i think of her
7028801 i miss her unbelievably much i cannot begin to tell you how much i miss her she is the love of my life
7028802 he had advice for how he deals with struggles and the mental side
7028803 they werent going after bad pitches and were hitting strikes this is a good lineup
7028804 i couldnt keep the ball in the park you have to keep the ball in the ballpark no matter where you pitch when you give up five runs on two swings its hard to win like that
7028805 it was a two seamer that ran down and away and i just went with it and was able to get good wood on it
7028806 i knew what was going on i was falling behind in counts and not being aggressive
7028807 tonight i came out attacked the strike zone and got ahead
7028808 here lately his fastball has been up more and out of the strike zone but the good pitches that he made the ball sunk and he kept it low
7028809 good god if i blow this there might never be a second
7028810 sent the crowd into a frenzy like a thunderbolt hit the theater
7028811 a black guy in the white house thats the ultimate one
7028812 all of us who broke down barriers faced a lot of resistance but now hes trying to break down the biggest barrier of all ive got to tell you when youre in the middle of that its a very scary feeling
7028813 and everybody told me that a black player couldnt do that
7028814 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
7028815 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
7028816 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
7028817 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
7028818 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7028819 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7028820 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
7028821 along with the state department the embassy here and congressman chris smith we got them home god bless america viva la france
7028822 i couldnt believe i was watching those faces i just thank god to return my girls to me
7028823 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7028824 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7028825 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7028826 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7028827 certainly there are high expectations from the public from the new government we will fulfill their aspirations by working in objective and planned manner for which we have outlined a number of national priority issues
7028828 first and foremost is the protection of national sovereignty independence and territorial integrity if nepal does not exist then there is no meaning for anything else including the republic but we have to strengthen the national unity based on full equality among people from himal pahad terai and madhes
7028829 i want to extend full commitment towards modern democratic principles like multi party competition period elections rule of law
7028830 our attention will be concentrated on addressing socio economic issues such as poverty unemployment and so on we will work to bring about modern industrial economy for which private public partnership model will be followed
7028831 the industrial peace will be maintained by improving relations between labor and employers
7028832 taking the peace process to logical conclusion and writing constitution on time is the main task of this government
7028833 this government also has huge challenges we need the support and cooperation from army police administration international community and general public to meet the challenges
7028834 the strike is part of continuing protests against indias rule in kashmir
7028835 it is also to demand our right to self determination through a referendum
7028836 the fighting that is still raging has so far left five militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7028837 hoy rusia no pudo con nosotras fue un d a estupendo en todos los sentidos
7028838 vlm airlines is honoured to receive this prestigious award which is a powerful endorsement of service from the people that really matter passengers we are dedicated to providing the highest levels of service and strive continually to set new standards
7028839 this award is particularly pleasing in that it demonstrates quality of service and service clearly matter to customers on short haul services vlm airlines were strongly supported in this survey category and were frequently singled out for the high standards of staff service they deliver the award is very much a recognition of the those customer facing staff
7028840 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense
7028841 nearly two months to have a pair of trousers mended which had been torn by a not completely screwed down screw on a jump seat meanwhile alitalia is back in the news with plans of new cuts they want to make but i have already made my cuts
7028842 once again we are short of cutlery so i am hard at work washing re washing and drying
7028843 there is a meal missing either it wasnt loaded or there are more passengers than we had booked
7028844 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
7028845 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
7028846 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
7028847 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves
7028848 my view is that the buffer zones are against the spirit of the ceasefire agreement
7028849 why do they want to take control of poti they do not have such a right
7028850 maybe they want to grab poti from us while we are still alive we will not allow them to stay here if they were our friends they would not do this
7028851 should we sit behind the fence what use would we be then they georgian forces will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them
7028852 war made easy how presidents and pundits keep spinning us to death
7028853 the argument billionaires bloggers and the battle to remake democratic politics
7028854 i think id be foolish after so many years of being here and as i said being here in the 70s when the reason why we voted this law into place fisa was that we found j edgar hoover and others were using this material for totally unrelated reasons than determining whether or not during the cold war some foreign government or agent was plotting against us and so i think it would be foolish of us to also make the assumption today that thats the only thing its being used for and even if it is being used for that purpose alone now what about the next president and the next president it requires that there be some point at which this activity is reviewed so somebody other than an administration official assuring us that no this is okay understands what it being reviewed
7028855 the first question i asked the attorney general on monday was the following how will we know when weve won the war
7028856 if id known that this administration would be so incompetent and i used that word advisedly in the way it went into iraq and what it did since in iraq shortchanging our military in everything from body armor to the number of forces needed miscalculating so drastically in terms of the horses that they were backing in iraq i would never have given this president that authority
7028857 first of all the bork nomination was the first time in about sixty years we acknowledged that the american public has the right to know what the constitutional methodology or philosophy of a justice is they have a right to know it i pointed out in that hearing and prior to that that up to this time one in every four justices nominated to the supreme court have been rejected by the united states senate since 1789 the first one being rejected by a number of signatories to the constitution who were in the senate at the time justice rutledge but what happened from that point on particularly in the past ten years has been that its become a bit of a stylized dance where whether its a moderate liberal or conservative nominee they come before the senate judiciary committee very very practiced and practiced in basically refusing to answer any questions directly on the grounds that it might somehow jeopardize their independence on the bench as a consequence of that there is very little known about their judicial philosophy in complicated issues theyre able to make it sound like theyre giving reasonable answers when in fact the answers being given may give significant insight to a justice being put on the court who might very well change the direction of the nation without the public being aware of it prior to that occurring you know up until 1953 with notable exceptions the nominees never came before the judiciary committee the committee would hold a hearing theyd bring in outside witnesses theyd look at the spoken and written record of the nominee theyd make a recommendation to the us senate on that nominee the senate would debate the nominee based on his or her public record and then they would vote what that does is that would put an incredible premium on the nominees outside the system that is not being before the judiciary committee to answer questions to the press and others as to what they really believe about issues it would take away this sort of veil that exists now where it appears as though questions are being answered when in fact there is no direct answer the basic premise is does the public have a right to know what a member of the third branch of government equally as powerful as the other two is likely to do about matters of life and death that affect them knowing that person is going to be there much longer than any president or any senator thats the fundamental question what is the publics right to know and these hearings basically say were not really entitled to know much of anything
7028858 in 1994 when the republican party took over the senate it became very very personal
7028859 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing and ongoing and ongoing but hopefully drawing to a conclusion
7028860 theres no doubt that there was one thing that the two parties agreed on getting rid of musharraf
7028861 musharraf stepping down at some level closes a chapter for pakistan its the last gate on the way back to democracy but that doesnt mean that democracy will be easier than dictatorship
7028862 the army wants the government to lead and take the political responsibility for going after the extremists so that the armys present unpopularity does not get worse
7028863 but mr sharif has no intention to become the cats paw of the army while mr zardari so far cannot hammer out a common coalition position
7028864 wants no concessions to the army and offers no support to the war against taliban extremists aware of his right wing vote bank he has little time for american demands
7028865 we have to also be offering a long term partnership with pakistan pakistani leaders suspect that if we succeed with al qaeda we will pull away from pakistan
7028866 weve done little to assure them that we see something beyond this very focused effort on terrorism
7028867 there is no escape from the fact that pakistan will be better off with a civilian government than a military dictatorship by and large the administration has accepted this
7028868 pakistan will become completely a democracy when there is civilian ownership of the security apparatus and foreign policy
7028869 the real difficulty for the u s is to make sure that with your actions you dont make the fragile civilian government more fragile
7028870 face aux wallabies il nous faudra acc l rer le rythme explique de villiers dans midi olympique je suis entre le marteau et lenclume mais nous ne pouvons plus faire machine arri re nous ne sommes qu 60 du but que nous voulons atteindre il va donc falloir encore avaler quelques couleuvres pour voir si nous pouvons franchir un cap

7028875 judging by the conduct of mr tsvangirai i have no doubt that zimbabweans are a determined people

7028877 union representatives have recently been appearing unannounced at the homes of some county employees
7028878 some employees have also received telephone calls at home even to unlisted employee telephone numbers i have confirmed that the county did not provide any personal employee information to union officials we think such actions are despicable
7028879 your home is your castle you show up there in the dark hours unannounced that is intimidation once im home get out of my face
7028880 they should feel free to make a decision based on their own free will
7028881 i dont think its wise to give up one percent of your pay check if someone wants to waste their money thats up to them i do not like the intimidation going on out there right now
7028882 the workers dont see the value of union representation they have this forced on them and its unfortunate
7028883 they dont want a grower to have anything to say about the consequences of unionization
7028884 even one heat related death is too many and the governor agrees that more needs to be done the governor remains opposed to card check but he will continue working with the legislature to come up with a solution to this problem
7028885 we are committed to leading a reform movement within labor and we will not tolerate any act that puts the interests of our members at risk
7028886 as our history shows when serious factual allegations are brought to our attention we act swiftly and decisively to ensure that our leadership is being held accountable to our members who work some of the toughest jobs in america
7028887 we have to see what kind of amendments come then only we can decide but we cannot accept prescriptive conditionalities
7028888 we met a lot of individual delegates of nsg member countries and had an opportunity to brief them on thursday
7028889 is a necessary step for cooperation between india and the nsg
7028890 the love and affection of the people has not changed from when i was in this city 10 years ago and a lot of other communities could learn a lot from the one here in leicester
7028891 i am delighted we have raised enough money to be able to acquire our own premises for the charity i never thought it would be as successful as it has been
7028892 for leicester to welcome a star of the calibre of amitabh bachchan is a great honour and one that i know will have delighted our british asian communities

7028896 education alerts is a way without being overly intrusive to interact with students who may not remember us very well and it gets them back into thinking about our school
7028897 education alerts identifies and contacts prospects that previously showed interest and rekindles interest without overextending our marketing department as a result weve captured a much larger percentage of students who we originally deemed as losses
7028898 while most career school owners presidents and marketing directors understand the value of recycling their inactive student leads few have the internal resources to mine the gold in their prospect databases
7028899 as the cost to keep the student lead pipeline full with quality student leads continues to increase across all media broadcast print and search engine advertising its critical for schools to recycle their inactive student leads thats where education alerts fits into a schools lead generation strategy
7028900 i know the price of success dedication hard work and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen
7028901 when you do the common things in life in an uncommon way you will command the attention of the world
7028902 the measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with but whether its the same problem you had last year
7028903 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7028904 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7028905 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7028906 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7028907 im fighting for my life ive no control over this disease and im bloody terrified
7028908 i am going to fight the damn thing every step of the way because i have two beautiful boys who are my world
7028909 but i have to be realistic and face the possibility that i might not live to see them grow up
7028910 im sitting here desperately trying to come to terms with the fact that i might die while people are out there accusing me of making my illness up
7028911 then it hit me that some women get cancer and never become mums
7028912 i realised i should be thankful for my gorgeous sons and decided i was going to take this horrible disease on and win
7028913 it is unbelievable how life is so unpredictable and finds a way to distract and derail you from your plans
7028914 my prayers are with jade her family in this hour when they face one of the biggest tests of their life in times ahead
7028915 i pray she comes out of this soon and stronger with happy memories from this country
7028916 i am totally focused on only one thing and that is taking this country through these difficult economic circumstances
7028917 we have got to get on with the job people want us to get on with the job getting on with the job is the most important thing at the moment
7028918 there is nothing wrong with the article the article is fine the publicity surrounding it is another thing
7028919 i think that you will find that the british economy is resilient
7028920 we have got to take people through these difficult economic times we have done it before and we will do it again
7028921 you cannot expect people to be cheering in the streets if you have oil prices rising and food prices rising

7028964 why would you start cutting and pasting now isnt that against your rules
7028965 how do you figure you cant prove that anything is 65 million years old none of the dating methods work you cant use the geological column because to make that work you have to use circular reasoning again a failure
7028966 we can only 100 date something and thats through history and we can only go back 4000 or so years with that
7028967 so to pull up 65 million year old dino bones and still have soft tissue in them is ludicrous

7028983 to be fair i dont think tim or any of those involved in the site would deny the distinctions you make
7028984 the key distinction between the anti americanism exhibited on the left and that which is most violently spewed by jihadists and jew haters is that caring about human rights social justice and the environment does not make you anti american and nor does criticising an administration for its failures in these areas its only when your criticisms involve such desperate flailing that they turn into attacks on the american people that you become a certified anti american

7029146 barack obama and the unrepentant terrorist bill ayers have worked closely together on education reform since 1995 and possibly since 1987 obama has obfuscated and minimized this association in his public statements and on his website why the cover up we dont know since we arent sure what is being concealed
7029147 spencer ackerman does a great job of parroting what beauchamp has been saying all along and manages to get a few digs in at the man who fired him as well what he doesnt do is prove his case all in all perhaps his greatest accomplishment was getting this four page non revelation published

7029151 it might behoove the mccain camp to point out their candidate belongs to the party that wants all americans to have a chance at living in a mansion
7029152 lets also be clear that obamas judgment was that the surge would not succeed and as of a month ago was not meeting our strategic goals
7029153 measles cases in the u s are at the highest level in more than a decade with nearly half of those involving children whose parents rejected vaccination
7029154 your pm column about vaccinations and your earlier post on making traffic safer have me thinking how does the perception of danger affect our behavior when people knew the danger of measles they jumped on the vaccine eagerly when the roads and intersections looked dangerous people drove more cautiously how does this affect our behavior in other ways im thinking the higher drinking age and defense spending also what about the flip side where you perceive too much danger and dont let your kids outside to play in the front yard there is a huge thread to put together there
7029155 i think i have a much higher i q than you do a bizarre videotaped putdown that biden immediately called into question with five 5 boasts about his academic record four 4 of which turned out to be easily disproved b s

7029159 he said he hadnt heard of any controversy so i asked when was the first time you heard mccain tell this story his response i heard that story in 1970 1971 back in that time frame anybody who says its not true is full of here he used some salty language
7029160 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
7029161 on june 15 2005 obama bought a gorgeous house in hyde park for 1 65 million 300 000 below the list price rezko bought the empty but attractive lot next door from the same seller at the same time obama would later buy part of rezkos lot overpaying him the transaction was shady but not obviously corrupt the overall obama rezko relationship looks worse
7029162 the truth is that mccain isnt out of touch with ordinary people because hes rich hes out of touch with his own domestic arrangements because he cares little about material things and for many years has devoted his extraordinary energies not to enjoying his wifes money but to serving the american people given the number of nights hes spent in hotels or on military bases over the last few years its no wonder he hasnt seen much of his wifes condos
7029163 openness has always been an integral part of science with scientists presenting findings in journals or at conferences but the open science movement with many of its leaders in the boston area encourages scientists to share techniques and even their work long before they are ready to present results when they are devising research questions running experiments and analyzing data in such open forums the wisdom of the crowd could offer the ultimate form of peer review and scientific information they say should be available without the hefty subscription fees charged by most journals

7029168 lets be clear our troops have completed every mission theyve been given
7029169 hard to believe that with our aggressive national media covering a presidential campaign that obama and daley could mange this cover up in plain sight yeah real hard
7029170 the fact is that all russian politicians are clever the stupid ones are all dead by contrast america in its complacency promotes dullards a deadly miscommunication arises from this asymmetry the russians cannot believe that the americans are as stupid as they look
7029171 we need to take the political parties back from the whacko activists
7029172 i have an elaborate nightmare where joe lieberman gets the vp nod mccain wins then dies and were looking at a president lieberman at which point i and a host of others bloggers who supported ned lamont wind up in guantanamo bay
7029173 note that hamshers response is very similar to those people who are for gun control because they know what they would do if they had a gun yep think there is more than a little projection there
7029174 john mccain is gaining in the polls nationally according to several independent measures as one of my colleagues pointed out the rasmussen daily tracking poll through the last week gives obama a stable 1 to 2 point lead over the past two weeks still not good news but also more reason to question the validity of the zogby results
7029175 with just days before the vice presidential announcements the political conventions and the final sprint to election day republican sen john mccain has cut democrat sen barack obamas national lead in half according to the latest nbc news wall street journal poll
7029176 perhaps the biggest factor keeping the presidential race close has been obamas inability to close the deal with some of hillary clintons supporters
7029177 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
7029178 the existence of a race of sentient alien robots might be not just possible but inevitable in fact we might be living in a postbiological universe right now in which intelligent extraterrestrials somewhere have exchanged organic brains for artificial ones
7029179 but in reality many of these people left or are leaving their corporate jobs to follow their own personal passions from their home based business where they hang the open sign
7029180 one of japans largest sake manufacturers gekkeikan has announced the development of a new super yeast able to produce cellulosic ethanol from non edible parts of plants such as paddy straw and chaff the super yeast that produces alcohol was created with genetic engineering by integrating koji mold genes that produce cellulolytic enzymes into sake yeast
7029181 obamas lead in the rcp national avg continues to slide down to just 1 2
7029182 whatever the case is with his own selfishness the evidence of an internationally superior american generosity is impressive beginning with the numbers on our charitable giving we give twice as much as the british per capita and according to the american magazine seven times as much as the germans and 14 times as much as the italians even in inflation adjusted dollars the amount given each year just keeps getting larger and meanwhile we do far more volunteer work than in other industrialized countries
7029183 mr obama 26 the youngest of the presidential candidates half brothers spoke for the first time about his life which could not be more different than that of the democratic contender
7029184 in isolating stories on the abc cbs and nbc broadcasts that were mainly focused on obama the center says 42 percent were positive and 7 percent negative
7029185 better yet the jetta tdi is nearly as much fun to drive as the gti
7029186 it cant help obama to show that mccain ad over and over again for the purpose of arguing about a stick and a sandal
7029187 sullivan and the msm are in the midst of buyers remorse regarding the shallow obama and desperate to find a way out or some justification
7029188 a much better candidate and much more conservative than obama
7029189 hillary would probably beat mccain if this happened because mccain would be blamed for this
7029190 im not and i never was mad at senator obama i think everybodys got a right to run for president if he qualifies under the constitution

7029241 when i was little and living in southern china it was very poor especially under japanese occupation
7029242 but now i have noticed all the changes and the people in china are better off
7029243 its inside how you feel and i dont know how to express it
7029244 the most important part is letting the world know about china most of the time they dont see the true colours of china it is not always how the press shows it
7029245 there is an issue im not denying that but we just need more to time to sort it out china is a big country and there is a lot of educating and developing to do
7029246 the truth is i dont know what they are going to do after the olympics but i would like it to stay that way i would like to see the olympic spirit continue
7029247 many people dont know china very well and the opening ceremony was all about chinas history
7029248 the director just wanted to show the best of china to the rest of the world
7029249 the west views china as poor with no food they want to show the world that china is growing up they want to connect with the world
7029250 the chinese government has problems same as every country there are so many people and it is difficult to change quickly i think the olympics have shown they are trying

7029256 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7029257 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7029258 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7029259 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7029260 i hope the wheaties box and all those types of things happen

7029267 nuclear weapon proliferation is the single most immediate threat hanging over the world today mr keating said
7029268 turned its hand to new bunker busting nuclear weapons designed to attack underground facilities
7029269 the plain fact is there can be no non proliferation without de proliferation
7029270 that is if the weapons states are not prepared to rid themselves of nuclear weapons why would other states continue to deny themselves the kind of leverage which these weapons bring
7029271 the old order of victorious powers with major powers hanging onto weapons of massive destruction is a remnant of the violent 20th century mr keating said
7029272 it cannot provide the basis for an equitable and effective system of world governance
7029273 just as world community concerns have been ahead of the political system on issues such as global warming so too world community concern needs to galvanise international action to find a new template for a lasting peace one embracing all the major powers and regions
7029274 this can be done but it requires leadership and imagination

7029284 we won without removing a single soldier or yielding an inch of territory
7029285 probably 90 percent of the games were good games and close and down to the wire and the crowds were into it
7029286 i think its a real shame theyre not going to have baseball in the 2012 olympics and i think it needs to come back its a summer sport and its one of the main sports in the world during the summer
7029287 weve had good crowds the whole time people have been into it
7029288 i really do believe its going to be back in 2016 especially if its in chicago or tokyo baseball is too important to both america and japan to have it not be in there
7029289 but well get to carry the bronze until in about eight years they can hopefully bring it back
7029290 and unless they find a way to have a couple week break i dont see them letting their best players leave you might take two or three players from a club and you might lose the pennant because of the timing
7029291 we have a lot of guys on our club that have been in the major leagues
7029292 and guys that are going to be in the big leagues eventually i really think its a shame that was said that big leaguers have to be on the team for baseball to come back
7029293 but we didnt bring it back i feel sorry about this we have never experienced such a tough time before
7029294 i experienced a lot through the game but it doesnt mean much if we dont have victory
7029295 i think we as a team feel pretty good about what weve accomplished
7029296 the teams that are going to be playing for gold and silver are obviously very good clubs overall were pretty happy to going to be going home with something

7029299 the administrations basic approach to foreign policy and national security i think has been bankrupted by reality the fixation on pre emption regime change and the simplistic slogans that encompass the war on terror i think literally not figuratively made us less secure made us less secure as a nation rather than more secure
7029300 the next president democratic or republican hopefully from my perspective a democrat will face an almost unprecedented series of challenges with very little margin for error

7029317 national conventions are almost always held in uncomfortable and filthy places
7029318 food is bad and expensive and everyone goes home exhausted and sore
7029319 there is something about a national convention that makes it as fascinating as a revival or a hanging
7029320 it is vulgar it is ugly it is stupid it is tedious it is hard upon both the higher cerebral centers and the gluteus maximus and yet it is somehow charming one sits through long sessions wishing all the delegates and alternates were dead and in hell and then suddenly there comes a show so gaudy and hilarious so melodramatic and obscene so unimaginably exhilarating and preposterous that one lives a gorgeous year in an hour

7029441 we are constantly looking at what threats could harm us
7029442 we recognize that there has been a change in the executive office in philadelphia
7029443 but the view of the current director of commerce for the city does not affect or undermine the legitimate exercise of the authority reposed in the former director of commerce
7029444 were grateful to the supreme court for ruling in our favor
7029445 the city law department is studying the opinion and doing an internal analysis and until theyre done we dont know what else it means for the city
7029446 this is not the end in any way shape or form there are many more issues to be resolved
7029447 the casinos are bad for the city and mayor nutter and gov rendell still want these things off the riverfront
7029448 were just hoping the city doesnt give us any more stumbling blocks and the permits start to go through
7029449 but were still planning on meeting with the governor and the mayor and other government officials to discuss our project
7029450 i believe that the city acted properly in revoking a license which it had no authority to have conferred
7029451 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
7029452 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at sen obamas campaign
7029453 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7029454 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7029455 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7029456 if and when we have something to announce thats when well talk about it
7029457 in philadelphia in particular location was important because it had to do with generating income
7029458 everything being equal the decisions may have come out differently
7029459 i just dont understand why the three who didnt win wouldnt seek relief allowing them to bid on the same sites
7029460 it leads to the location we had picked and thats where the project should go and it should go with some level of involvement from the original applicants from that site
7029461 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
7029462 were always evaluating whats happening in the marketplace and certainly something thats happening in the last couple of months is that sonys managed to sell some boxes
7029463 so whether or not you like developing for that platform if theyve got millions of people connected to that platform and buying their games you have to take it seriously
7029464 a grandmother is a lady who has no children of her own she likes other peoples girls and boys a grandfather is a man grandmother he goes for walks with boys they talk about fishing and stuff like that gransmothers dont have anything to do except to be there they are so old that they shouldnt play hard or run it is enough if they drive us to the store where the pretend horse is and have lots of money ready or if they take us for walks they slow down for things like pretty leaves and caterpillars they should never say hurry up usually gransmothers are fat but not too fat to tie your shoes they wear glasses and funny underwear they can take their teeth and gums off grandmothers dont have to be smart only answer questions like why isnt god married and how come dogs chase cats grandmothers dont talk baby talk like visitors do because its hard to understand when they read to us they dont skip or mind if its the same story over again everybody should have a grandmother especially if they dont have a television because they are the only grown ups who have time

7029466 prenez une minute pour partager un mot personnel de bienvenue joe dans notre mouvement pour le changement
7029467 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7029468 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago
7029469 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone
7029470 we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7029471 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7029472 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7029473 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience
7029474 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
7029475 its a well intended notion he has but its a very naive way of thinking how youre going to conduct foreign policy
7029476 i mean youve got the first sort of mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a story book man
7029477 i think theyve really lost faith in the american people in terms of leveling with them
7029478 its not even so much they dont trust which is a piece of it
7029479 the way to win is the bill clinton triangulation and the karl rove angering

7029496 when i came over here six years ago i couldnt believe the stereotypes which were held against germans
7029497 people would say oh youre from germany you must love david hasselhoff then
7029498 at first you think they must be someone who isnt all there but when the 20th person comes up to you and says it you realise theres a pattern
7029499 they say we have no sense of humour they ask if the show starts on time oh and they say you bombed my chip shop
7029500 i would have a show there where i said in german i would be performing for 45 minutes in english
7029501 that would let the audience see what the british comedy circuit was like then there would be an interval and afterwards we would speak in german about stereotypes
7029502 that certainly is a concept that i think has got lots of legs
7029503 i tried to do other jobs but they didnt really work out
7029504 once i was in a very serious play an adaptation of a hamlet piece from an east german writer director it set the hamlet story in east germany and it was very complicated
7029505 on the opening night we had 80 journalists in the audience but i was a circus act i wasnt sure i could do serious theatre
7029506 i just went on stage and did nothing and people started to laugh
7029507 i didnt come up here for no awards we were in it to win it so its been disappointing when institutional racism has held us back
7029508 i am nominated for letting down my trousers it is good to integrate my hobby and my profession

7029520 ustedes son los bendecidos por jehov el hacedor del cielo y de la tierra
7029521 mira las naciones son como una gota de un cubo y como la capa tenue de polvo en la balanza han sido estimadas mira l alza las islas mismas como simple polvo fino
7029522 jehov est cerca de todos los que lo invocan de todos los que lo invocan en apego a la verdad
7029523 el deseo de los que le temen y oir su clamor por ayuda
7029524 no se inquieten por cosa alguna sino que en todo por oraci n y ruego junto con acci n de gracias dense a conocer sus peticiones a dios y la paz de dios que supera a todo pensamiento guardar sus corazones y sus facultades mentales mediante cristo jes s
7029525 ac rquense a dios y l se acercar a ustedes l mpiense las manos pecadores y purifiquen su coraz n indecisos
7029526 aunque hagan muchas oraciones no escucho sus mismas manos se han llenado de derramamiento de sangre
7029527 por eso les digo todas las cosas que oran y piden tengan fe en que pueden darse por recibidas y las tendr n
7029528 sin fe es imposible agradar a dios ya que cualquiera que se acerca a dios tiene que creer que l existe y que recompensa a quienes lo buscan
7029529 en verdad como el cuerpo sin esp ritu est muerto as tambi n la fe sin obras est muerta
7029530 porque jehov es alto y no obstante al humilde lo ve pero al altanero lo conoce solo de distancia
7029531 cuando abr n alcanz la edad de noventa y nueve a os entonces jehov se apareci a abr n y le dijo yo soy dios todopoderoso
7029532 mas al orar no digas las mismas cosas repetidas veces as como la gente de las naciones porque ellos se imaginan que por su uso de muchas palabras se har n o r pues bien no se hagan semejantes a ellos porque dios su padre sabe qu cosas necesitan ustedes hasta antes que se las pidan
7029533 amortig en por lo tanto los miembros de su cuerpo que est n sobre la tierra en cuanto a fornicaci n inmundicia apetito sexual deseo perjudicial y codicia que es idolatr a
7029534 porque tanto am dios al mundo que dio a su hijo unig nito para que todo el que ejerce fe en l no sea destruido sino que tenga vida eterna
7029535 por eso as como por medio de un solo hombre el pecado entr en el mundo y la muerte mediante el pecado y as la muerte se extendi a todos los hombres porque todos hab an pecado
7029536 porque el padre no juzga a nadie sino que ha encargado todo el juicio al hijo
7029537 donde un precursor ha entrado a favor nuestro jes s que ha llegado a ser sumo sacerdote a la manera de melquisedec para siempre
7029538 yo soy el camino y la verdad y la vida
7029539 despu s de aquello el rey david entr y se sent delante de jehov y dijo qui n soy yo oh jehov dios y qu es mi casa para que me hayas tra do hasta aqu
7029540 entonces esdras bendijo a jehov el dios verdadero el grande a lo que todo el pueblo contest
7029541 pero daniel tan pronto como supo que el escrito hab a sido firmado entr en su casa y las ventanas de su c mara del techo estando abiertas para l hacia jerusal n hasta tres veces al d a se hincaba de rodillas y oraba y ofrec a alabanza delante de su dios como hab a estado haciendo regularmente antes de esto
7029542 y cuando est n de pie orando perdonen lo que tengan contra alguno para que su padre que est en los cielos tambi n les perdone sus ofensas
7029543 y en el mes de nis n en el a o veinte de artajerjes el rey aconteci que hubo vino delante de l y yo como siempre alc el vino y se lo di al rey
7029544 por qu est triste tu rostro cuando t mismo no est s enfermo esta no es otra cosa sino tristeza de coraz n
7029545 viva el rey mismo hasta tiempo indefinido por qu no debe ponerse triste mi rostro cuando la ciudad la casa de las sepulturas de mis antepasados est devastada y sus mismas puertas han sido comidas por el fuego
7029546 si al rey de veras le parece bien y si tu siervo parece bueno ante ti que me env es a jud a la ciudad de las sepulturas de mis antepasados para que la reedifique
7029547 cu nto va a durar tu viaje y cu ndo volver s
7029548 conf a en l a todo tiempo oh pueblo delante de l derramen ustedes su coraz n dios es refugio para nosotros
7029549 por lo tanto si ustedes aunque son inicuos saben dar buenos regalos a sus hijos con cu nta m s raz n dar el padre en el cielo esp ritu santo a los que le piden
7029550 por lo tanto si alguno de ustedes tiene deficiencia en cuanto a sabidur a que siga pidi ndole a dios porque l da generosamente a todos y sin echar en cara y le ser dada
7029551 bendito sea el dios y padre de nuestro se or jesucristo porque nos ha bendecido con toda bendici n espiritual en los lugares celestiales en uni n con cristo
7029552 por consiguiente pedro estaba guardado en la prisi n pero con intensidad la congregaci n se ocupaba en orar a dios por l
7029553 epafras que es de entre ustedes esclavo de cristo jes s les env a sus saludos y siempre est esforz ndose a favor de ustedes en sus oraciones para que al fin est n de pie completos y con firme convicci n en toda la voluntad de dios
7029554 en consecuencia david bendijo a jehov ante los ojos de toda la congregaci n y david dijo bendito seas oh jehov el dios de israel nuestro padre desde tiempo indefinido aun hasta tiempo indefinido
7029555 ustedes pues tienen que orar de esta manera padre nuestro que est s en los cielos santificado sea tu nombre
7029556 y sucedi que mientras ella oraba prolongadamente delante de jehov el estaba observ ndole la boca
7029557 cu dense de los escribas que desean andar por todos lados en ropas largas y a quienes les gustan los saludos en las plazas de mercado y los asientos delanteros en las sinagogas y lugares muy prominentes en las cenas
7029558 de otro modo si ofreces alabanzas con un don del esp ritu c mo dir
7029559 oh oidor de la oraci n aun a ti vendr gente de toda carne
7029560 pero con respecto a cu l de los ngeles ha dicho l alguna vez si ntate a mi diestra hasta que coloque a tus enemigos como banquillo para tus pies no son todos ellos esp ritus para servicio p blico enviados para servir a favor de los que van a heredar la salvaci n
7029561 y vi a otro ngel que volaba en medio del cielo y ten a buenas nuevas eternas que declarar como noticias gozosas a los que moran en la tierra y a toda naci n y tribu y lengua y pueblo
7029562 la solicitud ansiosa en el coraz n de un hombre es lo que lo agobia pero la buena palabra es lo que lo regocija
7029563 y sin embargo alguno de entre ustedes les dice vayan en paz mant nganse calientes y bien alimentados pero ustedes no les dan las cosas necesarias para su cuerpo de qu provecho es as tambi n la fe si no tiene obras est muerta en s misma
7029564 sin embargo tenemos este tesoro en vasos de barro para que el poder que es m s all de lo normal sea de dios y no el que procede de nosotros
7029565 hermanos aunque un hombre d alg n paso en falso antes que se d cuenta de ello ustedes los que tienen las debidas cualidades espirituales traten de reajustar a tal hombre con esp ritu de apacibilidad vigil ndote a ti mismo por temor de que t tambi n seas tentado
7029566 para todas las cosas tengo la fuerza en virtud de aquel que me imparte poder

7029572 if you do the history on most of the super bowl champions they have a pretty good defense and for him to go out and say that it means that he has a lot of confidence in our defense were all excited that he puts that on our shoulders
7029573 he got the point across to us pretty early in the offseason that we want to come out and set the tone
7029574 as a defense we felt like that all the time and its good to hear

7029612 the idea that gastronomy and sex are related is not new its been expressed through art literature early science in locker rooms beauty salons and on the street some examples of these expressions are included as context for the aphrodisiac recipes which follow for millennia cooks have prepared dishes enriched with ingredients they judged to be sensually invigorating and this tradition continues today some approaches are humorous while others are doubting and satirical yet others are ponderously medical this book is none of the above it offers an anthropological approach to the spicy life of love and food which includes cross cultural historical and current views it is the kind of natural history which consists of culinary history and recipes in equal measure after all the mind which is perhaps the most potent aphrodisiac should be cultivated in equal measure to the body which is physically stirred by erotic passion

7029619 i am always pleased when the students faculty and staff of the university of georgia are recognized for their quality and their very good work
7029620 recognition such as this is a reflection of a commitment to excellence in everything that we do at the university of georgia and should be a point of great pride for our alumni and friends
7029621 this is another affirmation of the high quality of the undergraduate program and the terry college overall
7029622 its now time for terry to expand from these areas of strengths like risk management and real estate and advance across an even broader front of program improvement when we adopt our new strategic plan later this year well be in a better position to pursue our vision of national prominence
7029623 i wouldnt put much weight at all on the polls right now
7029624 polls are not a good predictor until were past the conventions and into the main part of the campaign you should see a bump in the polls for both candidates after their conventions
7029625 obama has the best chance of turning over colorado new mexico and nevada
7029626 obama seems to have almost all of the states kerry won in 2004 locked up thats not true on the republican side which puts states like virginia ohio new mexico colorado indiana montana nevada and even alaska into play
7029627 the polls also dont reflect the tremendous amount of resources the campaigns are deploying in battleground states and in this case the obama campaign is way ahead of mccains
7029628 theyre putting a lot of money into the ground game to register people to vote and get out the vote if obama can get his supporters out to the polls hell win
7029629 the best opportunities for both candidates to shape their images its a clear shot at a very large audience both parties want to put on the best show possible
7029630 there is a danger for obama to act like he has already won and coming on too much like a celebrity especially given the setting for his speech in a football stadium some voters like that some dont whats interesting is that in a year where the democrats appeared poised to win everything the presidential race is still tight presidential politics essentially comes down to voters looking at two individuals and choosing one its a very personal preference more so than other elections

7029645 football season is one of the most exciting and anticipated times of the year in georgia
7029646 as many parents are sending children off to college it provides us with a great opportunity to encourage parents with younger children to start saving early while those children are still in elementary school or even before they ve taken their first steps

7029679 i feel that the amas statement may stem from a combination of ignorance or avoidance of the facts regarding out of hospital birth by skilled attendants and perhaps a desire to protect the business interests of the physician community
7029680 this is not to say that ama members do not care for their patients best interests but only that given the current medical climate it would not be surprising to see those outside pressures affect their conclusions
7029681 discourage another generation of doctors from considering alternatives to highly medicalized birth as most feel that any statements by the ama should be viewed as gospel
7029682 very few doctors have seen a birth without any medical intervention

7029691 al final me sacaron por giros de menos porque el circuito era muy corto hace tres a os que nunca me hab an sacado giros en una competencia me queda como ese gusto amargo que justo aqu y por culpa de una ca da no haya podido lograr mi meta de quedar entre las 20 mejores estaba bien aclimatada el calor y la humedad no me da aron pues hab a estado 10 d as entrenando en filipinas

7029721 sun is a large ship in mid turn and its low share price technology and customers could make it an attractive target to some larger players
7029722 theres a definite value in the technology that sun owns theres a ton of intellectual property
7029723 whenever people ask what is suns future then obviously the potential to be acquired comes in
7029724 i could be wrong but i think management is far more focused on fixing the business rather than selling the company
7029725 we are making changes to deliver consistent and expanding profitability
7029726 although the last two quarters were tough for sun we continue to see great progress
7029727 operationally i think sun is going down the right path but i just dont think the growth is being seen as quickly as investors want to see it
7029728 thats been out there for ages at least for the past decade
7029729 there is no doubt that the companys technology talent customer base and brand still command respect in the industry
7029730 if an acquirer could buy sun at a discounted price and then execute or facilitate the turnaround that has been close or elusive for sun it could represent a significant payoff
7029731 im thinking if other companies are capable of giving us our phone number why cant at amp t
7029732 temporary repairs have been made by at amp t and minimal effort on the part of the company has been made to solve the problem
7029733 weve escalated this but as you can imagine it may take longer to complete
7029734 evidently theyre finally bowing to the concerns that there is an issue out here
7029735 the biggest worries schools have are hackers getting into the web site
7029736 obviously being interested in computers i asked the student what he was working on the kid replied that he was hacking into the finance office computer so he could mark his tuition account as paid
7029737 its a nightmare the new web 2 0 apps are giving students more ways to get in
7029738 part of the challenge is that the kids in one school will take down the networks of other schools its like having a snow day to them schools have become so dependent on technology to run the office and deliver instruction in the classroom taking down the networks is equivalent to removing the cash registers from wal marts without the technology people cant function
7029739 these include the introduction of malware the need for effective gateway controls and bandwidth consumption we are seeing a significant increase in web 2 0 coming into the schools these new uses are straining all hardware with bottlenecks the peaks in demand raise concerns that school networks cannot handle the traffic schools have to re evaluate their networks
7029740 all of this we didnt traditionally let them do because of security and bandwidth concerns
7029741 weve had to relax our posture to let them all have access this presents us with an interesting challenge i cant say no anymore
7029742 at this point the sense we get from school it administrators is they are constantly fighting bandwidth
7029743 the growing issue is what should it managers do with smartphone and related devices
7029744 when these devices are used it doesnt know it is happening it presents new issues to us these devices can be lost and other users have more readily available access the smartphone has become a us 79 laptop
7029745 we need to push teachers to use educationally sound web sites rather than blogging sites
7029746 it is very difficult to separate the good from the bad on these popular general use web sites
7029747 teachers dont realize that ultimately the school district is responsible for any abuses that occur teachers have to share that responsibility for what their students access in school
7029748 schools have to be current with their use of security technology one of the biggest mistakes it people at schools make is putting all their security on the perimeter over the last few years we are seeing spikes inside the networks now it has to harden the network data center even from its own users
7029749 we found that early life infections recurrent otitis having a dog as a newborn and growing up in a larger family was independent of each other and independent of other confounders related to snoring in adulthood
7029750 this is a very general study based on a questionnaire that simply was distributed to a large number of subjects you could find statistical significance however the meaning of this significance to the clinical arena is unclear
7029751 we speculate that all these factors could promote an enlargening of tonsils with mouth breathing and a subsequent change of the mandibular growth that could promote snoring in adulthood
7029752 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
7029753 de loock y esa nariz que no se porque no se la ha operado cada vez esta peor

7029756 the significance of our study is that it identifies smurf1 as the signaling partner through which tnf does its damage in ra related bone loss
7029757 enables us to begin designing small molecule drugs to shut down the action of smurf1 and its relatives furthermore since mice engineered to have less smurf1 develop thicker bones future drugs that shut down smurf1 may be also useful against more common forms of osteoporosis simply by changing the dose of course this is early stage work with many obstacles ahead but is exciting nonetheless
7029758 you can measure the lengths of individual molecules and the average will be a pretty good description of any one
7029759 are all over the place theyre so diverse that its difficult to get one measurement that describes all of the possible structures
7029760 generated lots and lots of structures for both normal tau and a mutant form
7029761 a list of all types of suspect conformations for known tau mutants then from that list we can design drugs for each
7029762 for people with obesity and reflux together the gastric bypass procedure appears to be effective not only for weight loss but also for the control of reflux symptoms
7029763 because in this case most of the acid from the stomach is being partitioned away so it doesnt have exposure to the esophagus
7029764 however with gastric banding the problem is that you actually create a pocket which acid has the ability to fill from the remainder portion of the stomach
7029765 and this acid can just sit there above the band and make its way back up to the esophagus this can cause reflux disease to develop or make it worse than it had been if it was a problem before the procedure
7029766 gastric bypass is the most common and the most successful of the surgical procedures to deal with obesity
7029767 but the advantage to the banding procedure is that although it will not be an effective option for all patients depending on the level of obesity its a lot less aggressive than bypass and has a lot less morbidity associated with it and its much more reversible so there are reasons some patients might choose that option
7029768 both bypass and banding are not without their set of complications and this study illustrates that while solving one problem perhaps you worsen another so i would say that if youre going into any of these procedures to deal with obesity and you have significant reflux you definitely first need to have an appropriate evaluation as if you were considering an anti reflux procedure
7029769 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
7029770 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellant relatively little is known about how it actually works
7029771 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellants are compared
7029772 futher investigation of this relationship is needed with stratification of patients by the number of cigarettes smoked and attention to the length of time before and or after surgery that patients refrain from smoking
7029773 un estiramiento brusco en el partido de cuartos despu s de esperar se ha confirmado una rotura fibrilar del adductor largo de la pierna derecha y del m sculo gracilis lesi n que le impide competir y que necesita dos o tres semanas de recuperaci n

7029776 we believe this group was made up of six youths some were wearing hooded tops others were wearing bandanas sometimes concealing their faces
7029777 there is no indication that ahmed was assaulted before he fell
7029778 having recovered cctv evidence it is apparent that after ahmed fell five of the six youths left the area they were seen riding on pedal cycles along paragon road away from mare street
7029779 for me it looks as if it came from old stocks
7029780 as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex
7029781 it is significant in the sense that there was semtex in the explosive charge it did not go off but there was semtex there where it came from i dont know
7029782 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups
7029783 weve had attempted murders in londonderry and dungannon and spamount and now lisnaskea
7029784 im not so sure with the reduction of police resources in the province and the removal of the army that the psni have the resources at this present time to deal with this escalation and if its not nipped in the bud very quickly it will get worse
7029785 if you are concerned about carcinogens marinating a product and this would be any kind of muscle food product is a good way to dramatically reduce the formation of hcas
7029786 actually a grill runs at higher temp so the effect probably would be more dramatic
7029787 then you can cook it really well done and have no hcas
7029788 vegetarian cooking on the grill isnt going to give you any of these things
7029789 the technique we are working with can tell the difference between healthy enamel and decaying enamel and so in the future if this technology is further developed a dentist could identify early decay using it
7029790 however that is not to say dentist drills would become obsolete
7029791 i think there will always be those of us who like our sweets a bit too much and visit the dentist too infrequently to keep them in business
7029792 anything that means that there might be fewer filling materials used in the mouth is a tremendously positive development
7029793 i salute any technology that will scan the mouth and prevent cavities before they occur so we can try to have the least intervention in the mouth as possible
7029794 this basic intervention implementing a household smoking ban has the potential to promote antismoking norms and to prevent adolescent smoking
7029795 this study provides evidence that even in a smoke free home environment parental behavior remains a strong influence on teen smoking attitudes and behavior
7029796 these bans send a strong message to teens that its not ok to smoke and in the face of so many other external factors that may influence teens to smoke peers advertising a home smoking policy is one thing that parents can control to some extent
7029797 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
7029798 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate expression of virulent genes
7029799 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
7029800 we are making you an offer but based on this summer we think that you would be happier elsewhere

7029820 tan gracioso que aquellas chicas contaban pues aunque el sabia que lo habian visto entrar al bar ellas no paresian haberlo reconocido y mas aun daba la imprecion de que no lo conocian imaginense el esfuerzo de las bakas para lograr despistar a jin
7029821 minna de acuerdo con la informacion que nos mandan las bakas que estan siguiendo a jin todo marcha perfecto asi que ma ana mismo nos vamos a japon para poner en marcha el resto del plan
7029822 empezaron a hablar de lo bien que se lo pasaban montando fiestas en lugares alejados con gente desconocida pues era mejor estar rodeado de extra os sin conexion con el mundo que con gente que lo conoce todo vale podeis cambiar el tema de conversacion eh xd que no se me ocurre na xd jin se asombr le gustar a estar en una fiesta donde no le reconocieran mas llegar para poder hacer lo que le saliera de la mismisima

7029840 we hope they will be able to arrive we are optimistic

7029954 the rebate if translated will cost between 35 sen and 40 sen a litre if the people do not appreciate the rebates it is better for us not issue any more in the future
7029955 it is better for us to transfer the allocation for the rebate to reduce the fuel price
7029956 however we do not resort to such measure because if we transfer to pump prices people driving big cars such as bentley jaguar and bmw 7 series will also enjoy the subsidies

7029959 its not been the best of starts tearing my calf so its been a frustrating time ive tried to come back but its not ready yet its getting there though we are close
7029960 ive never been one for being injured throughout my career ive been really lucky so when i am its very frustrating
7029961 its more so now because of the timing im at a new club where i want to impress and show people what i can do its the start of the season so every player wants to be playing
7029962 im a really bad watcher obviously i want the us to win and play well but i dont like watching
7029963 alan smith the physiotherapist has dealt with exactly this injury with stan collymore when they were at leicester so it is not a problem i think freddie is very positive
7029964 he couldnt be in any better hands and roddy macdonald the doctor is very pleased with the fella who did the operation in london
7029965 i want to get his contract sorted out and i will be speaking to him rest assured that will be resolved it wont be a problem
7029966 in terms of his return it is hard to tell it is hard for me to put on a time i think the prognosis was four to six months
7029967 he is going to take a break now in holland he will then come back and we will get the plaster off in a couple of weeks then we will see how he is
7029968 we were slightly nervous about the queens retail park when b amp q moved out but it is nice to see new names coming in to fill the vacuum
7029969 it shows there is confidence in the future of stafford it is still a highly desirable area and there are opportunities here
7029970 the regeneration plans for stafford are creating extreme interest and the town is rated 15th in the country as the most desirable place to live
7029971 growth is continuing to take place and we will see large growth over the next five years
7029972 im biding my time because at a club the size of wolves you have to work at it and try to force my way into the team when i do i have to be ready to take it
7029973 im not frustrated at all because ive come to a club like wolves just being involved in the squad is a great feeling
7029974 ive just got to make sure im ready when im called upon im ready to come on lead the line and do what the other strikers have been doing so im not disappointed
7029975 it was definitely good for me because i needed the minutes under my belt so i can get my fitness levels up for when im called upon by the gaffer
7029976 i think chris has set the standard because goals get you noticed sylvan ebanks blake got the golden boot last season and hes a great scorer andy keogh can also get goals too
7029977 the manager cant drop chris but thats good for the team because weve got good competition
7029978 i think i have improved a lot since ive been at wolves because im working at a different level
7029979 the players i train and play with and the coaches too have been great i just need to take that to another level and push for the first team by training as hard as i can

7029982 dit is zonder twijfel de meest indrukwekkende cast die we ooit hebben gehad in de dertien jaar dat we filmfragmenten maken voor command amp onquer
7029983 het niveau van de acteerprestaties zowel van de individuele acteurs als van de groep maakt de verhaallijn zoveel intenser het productieniveau van deze filmbeelden doet niet onder voor dat van films en televisieseries en daar zijn we bijzonder tevreden mee

7029990 we are not experienced sailors as a result there is concern about the health and safety of the people on board should an emergency develop
7029991 we are currently experiencing rough sea conditions and we call on the greek government and the international community to meet their responsibilities and protect the civilians on board our two ships in international waters
7029992 if they want to make provocations then we will know how to deal with them
7029993 i mean we played pretty well all tournament disappointed with the semi final against spain but today everything just came together for us
7029994 i wish wed played like that in the semi final but absolutely rapt with the way the boys played today and you couldnt ask for a better finish
7029995 i think it was just the one performance really in the semi final
7029996 in the end we were just beaten by a better team in that semi final but thats what you learn to live with and it will take a while to get over that performance but well just move on and get on with the next one
