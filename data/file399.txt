3990000 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
3990001 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilisation development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behaviour in scape goating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq
3990002 the continuation of the presence of foreign forces in the country and certain wring policies and practices on the part of foreign forces there
3990003 there is a mechanism which is agreed between iraq and these countries on what these countries can do through the meeting of interior ministers of these countries through the expanded neighbouring countries conferences which took place in kuwait and anther one that is going to take place in jordan in fall
3990004 we are going to continue these negotiations through diplomatic channels
3990005 we hope that any improvement in the relationship between iran and the u s will help the situation in iraq
3990006 it is noteworthy that despite these groundless allegations to date no single credible evidence has ever been presented to substantiate them
3990007 to the contrary several high ranking iraqi officials are on record stressing irans constructive role in the country and rejecting the solid allegation
3990008 the united states accuses iran because the two countries have as yet not resolved their outstanding disputes
3990009 the accusation is designed to stem irans rising regional influence which the u s itself helped to enhance by overthrowing two of the islamic republics most implacable enemies the taliban and saddam hussein regimes
3990010 in addition during these operations numerous jish al mahdi militia fighters and leaders of jish al mahdi associated highly trained special groups fled to iran where they received sanctuary
3990011 as far as the u s is concerned the accusation has the advantage of undermining irans image in the eyes of iraqi shiites by blaming iran for the nefarious activities of the discredited elements in the mahdi army
3990012 the allegations are also designed to provide credence for americas narrative that depicts iran as a deceitful untrustworthy and hypocritical power which while professing to support the central government in baghdad trains funds and arms iraqi prime minister nouri enemies
3990013 irans role in iraq is a by product of u s iran relations
3990014 when u s iran relations have stalled irans role in iraq would likely be unconstructive and when u s iran relations are cooperative then irans role in iraq might be cooperative it doesnt necessarily mean that the u s has to pull out from iraq
3990015 the security situation has improved not simply because of the surge but because of a host of other factors including the successful completion of ethnic cleansing in key areas and americas success in buying off former sunni insurgents
3990016 economic conditions the improving performance of the iraqi military the decision on the part of iran to lend greater support to the iraqi central government instead of shiite militias as well as blunders on the part of al qaeda and setbacks suffered by moqtada al sadr

3990023 think of the children the children in al khazna need you
3990024 the children here deserve me just as much all the children deserve the same opportunities
3990025 yes but the children in al khazna have no teacher theres no one to teach them
3990026 so theyre all just sitting in a room with no teacher or supervision
3990027 yes you can go you know the point system really well youre a regional manager so you must be a very good teacher and you obviously care about the children a lot
3990028 why we were being so rude when they had always been so kind towards us and tried to take care of us

3990040 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3990041 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3990042 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3990043 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3990044 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3990045 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3990046 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3990047 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3990048 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3990049 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3990050 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3990051 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3990052 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3990053 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3990054 heres a good shape on the chart lets go for it
3990055 couldnt find default preferences the data directory may be missing 1004
3990056 c users your user name documents my spore creations creatures
3990057 i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can if i can do that ill be fine
3990058 the most important thing is being able to separate the two events and just move on ive trained for it im used to it the biggest part for me in the psychological part
3990059 what a great way to finish with a gold medal and a world record
3990060 for us to break the record by so far is amazing i really look back to sitting back and cheering for the aussies
3990061 i did my best and ran out of room at the end
3990062 it definitely gives me more motivation im a little bit tired and i have a full day to recover
3990063 i cant believe it after the relay i could have sunk but i told myself that after all these years of hard work i cant let myself go down my legs were shaking at the start i was really tense just like the other seven guys
3990064 its a new generation and its now time to step aside they did a great job im from the previous generation
3990065 i was so calm that i think i could have seen each face in this venue
3990066 so to go out there and accomplish a medal is really exciting it doesnt top the relay medal but its something ive been pushing for for years
3990067 our pc customers are not value added resources they are a serious business challenge so lets just withdraw from that unvalued market segment
3990068 who are you tell us something about you tell us something anything that you remember about your past
3990069 did you ever realize that you are fighting against your own people
3990070 my people my own people i was fighting for myself i was fighting for appreciation
3990071 one day one of the officers came to us and told us that we have finished our training and tomorrow has to undergo 3 major tests first test was to kill some villagers some of us asked the reason and failed i was very happy i took my riffle and went at the spot those villagers were begging for their life i showed no mercy we played a game of cat and mouse people were running for their lives and we were killing them with a sniper sitting on a chair and having beer for each head shot one tandoor was the prize the second test was to kill our own parents that was the first time after 5 years that i was going out of the camp and went to our village at my home abbu and ammi were very happy to see me after so long ammi started crying they thought that these people have killed me i slept for some time on ammis lap abbu was asking me too many questions i was waiting for my sister but when i couldnt see her for long time i suddenly wake up pointed gun at both of them and bang bang and there was blood all over i still remember the expressions on my parents face
3990072 after this we had been told that 3 of us had been selected as a best soldier and tomorrow is the feast day for 3 of us we were proud of ourselves and were waiting for the feast day next day one truck arrived at camp and we thought those are the new slot of trainees but we got stunned when we saw number of nude girls trailed towards us that was really a feast day for us i was more surprised to see my little sister in that bevy she was grown up now and was looking sexy
3990073 she was looking sexy i was eager to taste her wasting no time i went to her and hold her in my arms she thought i was comforting her and suddenly i kissed her lustfully i was blind with lust for her i was his big brother who could have saved her from those monsters but for me it was just a flesh to satisfy my lust i enjoyed doing the act all night she was crying and shouting
3990074 i enjoyed even more when my partners did the act with her
3990075 well done my boy now you have passed the third and final test and are all set for the fight till now you were living for freedom and tomorrow you are going to die for the same you are the true freedom fighter
3990076 ohhh yes did i tell you that during this training period i was injected almost 50 times for this stupid narcotics test so though you have injected me its of no use this injection makes no difference to me this is what suicide bombers are made of no one can command my mind as i have failed in the task given to me i have no rights to live but my mission to kill prime minister will be done by tomorrow by someone for sure ya allah
3990077 hey mister you know your supposed to properly light that thing right
3990078 we dont have to worry about iraq turning into another vietnam because we have an exit strategy

3990083 keo thyvuth was the chief of personnel on the cambodian side of the court we understand from press reports and statements from the national side of the court that he has been replaced i would suggest contacting the cambodian authorities for more details on the circumstances of regarding his replacement as for the japanese funding it is a bilateral issue between tokyo and the cambodian government again i would suggest contacting the japanese and cambodian missions
3990084 the american dream is getting harder and harder to reach
3990085 i want to first of all express my condolences to the families of these murdered humanitarian workers
3990086 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces not just military people but all those who are there trying to help rebuild this country
3990087 this was a despicable senseless and cowardly attack on people who were working to improve the lives of some of the most disadvantaged people in afghanistan women and girls and children with disabilities who live in conflict zones
3990088 i join the international community in condemning this brutal act
3990089 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom

3990183 there isnt an event like the olympics in terms of offering viewer choice and we know from previous games that nothing drives red button usage the way the olympics does in 2004 the first interactive olympics we did we had more than 10 million people go interactive just on the satellite platform thats more than double the next most popular event the bbcs ever done wimbledon with about four million more than anything we can do whether its glastonbury or another sports event the olympics gets people looking on interactive tv

3990187 when it comes to sport the real appeal is with the bbc sport website
3990188 every broadcaster has a strategy for dealing with something like this we are not a commercial organisation nbc are that may be why theyve chosen to hold back some of their content from the web for us its all about universal access we want universal reach were not about making money we just want more and more people to access the games in however many ways they want to there arent any limitations for us im sure they have very different considerations

3990272 the idea started with the irish blog awards and the recognition that there were so many categories people said there should be the same kind of awards for websites
3990273 people were saying these sites are great i spend all my time there boards ie recently had its 10th anniversary and married people have said how they met each other on it theres a huge community out there that seems to be almost ignored by the other awards because theyre not commercial business sites there are tonnes of niche areas out there that other awards because they are already so big dont cover
3990274 our previous involvement with the blog awards showed us the power of online communities and the immense pride people have for their work as well as the work of each other
3990275 while the web in itself represents a far greater magnitude of traffic than blogs i dont think it will eclipse the blog awards instead what we want to do is take the energy of the blog awards and give it to the web community at large
3990276 enterprise ireland supports about 75 high potential start ups a year and 12 15 come out of the academic system we would like to double the number of spin outs coming from academic research

3990278 we are running tests on this now and were getting accuracies of about 91pc this approach to screening can be a lot more effective than human supervision because people processing data may not always realise that information is sensitive
3990279 you could for example specify that youre interested in the share prices of 10 companies you want to know about those companies now not when you get around to looking at your emails
3990280 on the supply side the cancellation of a conference could mean that within a day or two a big hotel would have hundreds of beds available for example the time limit usually means nothing can be done most travel agencies already have plenty of people on their books asking for cut price deals with an instant messaging service all they would have to do is sign on to receive the latest alerts
3990281 there hadnt been a way for this group to get together before so there was an outpouring of views there was a perception that applied research is looked down upon by some academics as a sort of selling out but the event showed huge energy and interest if we really get this commercialisation thing right it will improve our international reputation and increase our chances of being world beaters in certain areas like alternative energy production for example

3990305 presently the stock is trading at rs 305 which is at 7 61 times to its earnings and 2 18 times to its book value of rs 140 16 since the stock seems to offers extremely good investment opportunities we initiate a buy signal on the stock with a target price of rs 430 in medium to long term investment horizon expecting an appreciation of about 41 from the current level of rs 305

3990346 sports have been very good to me throughout my life and my hope is to help provide sporting opportunities to young people everywhere we feel that a great place to start creating those opportunities is right here in southern california
3990347 we know that good coaching means working closely with families and helping athletes create a balanced life perspective we aim to take the socal high school mountain bike teams in the same direction as we have in northern california working to make cycling as important as baseball football and soccer in the fabric of our high schools

3990356 investing in socially responsible stocks just because they are socially responsible is not underline not a valid investment thesis
3990357 the genocide in sudan and the threats out of iran have prompted us to initiate a three pronged strategy to look at our investments in oil companies in sudan and companies in the energy sector in iran
3990358 the prism through which we look at this is fiduciary
3990359 especially with iran we have left open the option of divestiture and it could lead up to that
3990360 when we made the decision there was all of this tobacco litigation other institutional investors were saying they were going to divest and there were unprecedented risks to the industry
3990361 it will be a watershed event if one of the largest public pension funds after aggressively adopting socially responsible investment criteria abandons it
3990362 it would be a huge public statement that this strategy doesnt work
3990363 it would require the board to make investment decisions for the purpose other than providing benefits to members and beneficiaries
3990364 public funds have been feeling pressure to divest from sudan iran whatever the flavor of the week is
3990365 these funds are now pushing back because it ties their hands
3990366 that is a pretty good argument but with that rationale they would have to divest in mcdonalds or anheuser busch

3990381 as the world burns 50 simple things you can do to stay in denial
3990382 some officials described the program as a large data mining operation the times said and described it as much larger than the white house has acknowledged
3990383 a year after the calea communications assistance for law enforcement act passed in 1994 the fbi disclosed plans to require the phone companies to build into their infrastructure the capacity to simultaneously wiretap 1 percent of all phone calls in all major u s cities this would represent more than a thousandfold increase over previous levels in the number of phones that could be wiretapped in previous years there were only about a thousand court ordered wiretaps in the united states per year at the federal state and local levels combined its hard to see how the government could even employ enough judges to sign enough wiretap orders to wiretap 1 percent of all our phone calls much less hire enough federal agents to sit and listen to all that traffic in real time the only plausible way of processing that amount of traffic is a massive orwellian application of automated voice recognition technology to sift through it all searching for interesting keywords or searching for a particular speakers voice if the government doesnt find the target in the first 1 percent sample the wiretaps can be shifted over to a different 1 percent until the target is found or until everyones phone line has been checked for subversive traffic the fbi said they need this capacity to plan for the future this plan sparked such outrage that it was defeated in congress but the mere fact that the fbi even asked for these broad powers is revealing of their agenda
3990384 authorized investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities
3990385 currently the fbi is strengthening systems engineering in order to tie new systems together architecturally and ensure that standards for custom and packaged applications are enforced and it needs engineers to accomplish this goal the agency said
3990386 the fbi is also focusing on data warehousing as well as federated search technology which allows a single search query to be deployed across a number of databases regardless of whether those databases belong to the same protocol or platform
3990387 warehousing has been very successful yet enterprise extraction translation and loading processes must be fine tuned
3990388 data engineers are needed to model legacy databases for federated search and participate in legacy transition planning
3990389 databasification in other words does have a dark side increasing government access to private collections of information some privacy activists cite this cooperation as a reason to regulate private databases which makes as much sense as preventing companies from manufacturing binoculars simply because police can use them for unlawful surveillance the more sensible approach is to restrict the power of the police to snoop in the first place that means taking steps such as updating the privacy act of 1974 to limit government access to outsourced databases increasing the authority of inspectors general at federal agencies to monitor data abuses boosting criminal penalties for lawbreaking cops requiring police to meet higher standards of proof before perusing databases and most important rethinking the drug laws that invite snooping into americans personal lives about 78 percent of domestic wiretaps conducted with court oversight in 2002 were for drug offenses investigations of violent crimes such as murder kidnapping and extortion accounted for just 6 percent focusing on government power would keep intact the undeniable advantages of databasification lower prices cheaper mortgages and more efficient uses of information while limiting possible abuses by law enforcement the aim should be to retain the tremendous benefits of living in a database nation while preventing it from devolving into a police state
3990390 bruce ratner is someone who reminds us all the time that even in difficult financial times we need to be a city that continues to grow
3990391 families shouldnt have to look forward to a lottery they should simply know they are going to a zoned school
3990392 its ironic someone going for treatment and they perish in a plane crash
3990393 only the people involved in the most pedestrian concerns could participate in government
3990394 part of the public perception is that the giving of large contributions could be a way to curry favor with politicians
3990395 whether that perception is real the whole purpose of the law is to improve the publics faith in the electoral system
3990396 its pretty troubling that the government is blacklisting people and identifying them as particularly risky threats of corruption when theyve done nothing
3990397 they have been presumed guilty instead of innocent just because of their prominence in the community
3990398 there are a tremendous number of ways in which an individual or entity can be engaged in business dealings with the city and it was an enormous undertaking to come up with a definition
3990399 that strikes me as utterly irrational and has got to go
3990400 theyre essentially saying that if you do business with the city the value of your money should be lessened those people get their megaphones taken away while everyone else gets government amplification
3990401 rock n roll gave me a place for that music to live
3990402 i think you will find virtually all of the city council in the end signing on
3990403 and i might point out that theres almost nobody that signed that letter almost nobody from queens they were from other places where perhaps they are getting support from real estate interests who just want to be able to be in a position to hold up the city
3990404 i am surprised at this very undemocratic event you have stifled this press conference and you should not have done that as an elected official of new york shame on you
3990405 it protects by height limits in some parts of the east village that are predominantly white and will encourage development in areas where people of color live

3990410 this camp was run by hizb e islami and there were about 15 people including foreigners there at the time of the attack
3990411 they arent even letting residents who live nearby go there but our information is that they have recovered nine bodies
3990412 they were three men who suddenly stood up during the meeting and one of them opened fire on him
3990413 pas should support anwar even though we are hardly similar in political ideology
3990414 whenever pas has been in a coalition with other parties it has fared well in elections
3990415 so pas needs anwar if it wants to do well outside of the malay heartland and that the party members cannot deny
3990416 the opposition offers more possibilities because it is very new if they win there could be opportunities for pas like getting ministerial posts for islamic affairs
3990417 political risk has become a major problem in malaysia and has the potential to destabilise the nation
3990418 housing must be available to all americans without regard to disability
3990419 we will continue to pursue those who fail to design and construct accessible housing as required by federal law
3990420 can you do the same thing for us here in harlem
3990421 a charter school has a better education than a public school
3990422 when you walk down the streets of harlem youre going to walk different than everyone else
3990423 youre going to talk different youre going to talk about leadership youre going to talk about your futures
3990424 its too bad there arent more people its a nice atmosphere
3990425 we are pleased with our restaurants here and our brands positioning amidst the wide expanse of the games and its spectators
3990426 obviously it would have been nice to see more numbers earlier
3990427 but we are seeing a growing trend which will continue once the track and field competition begins in the 91 000 seat birds nest later this week
3990428 we are aware of this issue we are already planning to invite more people to the olympic green we definitely want more people and spectators
3990429 the forbidden city takes two hours to walk around and thats just a little bit compared to here

3990436 according to the investigation the van was at fault and violated traffic rules
3990437 the crucial question was how to obtain objective knowledge and also essential how to assure the public would accept it as objective
3990438 democrat or republican you set party aside and turned to empirical evidence when you got to nber
3990439 a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than a few months
3990440 metaphorically speaking the berlin wall had been replaced by the jersey turnpike
3990441 a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than a few months normally visible in real gross domestic product real income employment industrial production and wholesale retail sales
3990442 the indicator which sticks out most for condominium sales for 2008 is that the total number of transactions are down 21 in
3990443 the number of days on the market has blown out from 117 to 135 so its taking almost a month longer to sell fewer apartments which are inventory nevertheless prices continue to hold up but having said that we are still selling at sales volume of 2006 in terms of number of transactions
3990444 we are selling less and working longer with a product that hasnt yet adjusted downward in price while having to navigate a mortgage landscape that changes weekly and daily
3990445 sales are down about 32 and open business meaning contracts signed is down about 40 this means the closed sales figures will get worse
3990446 sellers of condos in this market are coming to realize that sales are slow and they are looking at the fall selling season as a litmus test of how much discounting they will have to do in 2009
3990447 in this market today if the product is not in the right location there is little incentive to purchase in a slowing market especially with fewer mortgages or credit readily available and today as opposed to a few years ago there is little potential of a run up in appreciation of pricing in the next several years
3990448 the manhattan market has definitely slowed considerably but it could be the summer doldrums
3990449 existing contract holders are closing per terms of contracts signed up to 24 months ago once in a while i hear a mention of financing difficulty but it has not caused the loss of a sale
3990450 sales are slower than i would have thought the summer makes it an unfair comparison lets see what happens in september but my gut tells me that if there is not stability in the stock market and we continue to see the types of swings and lack of traction people will be hesitant to pull the trigger unless they really have to this is why we are keeping our prices below what i would originally have put them out and have spent tons of dollars on finishes
3990451 negative press on the manhattan real estate market does not help either many people are waiting for the shoe to drop which despite a small dip i do not feel will happen
3990452 in general sales throughout the new york city marketplace are limp at best
3990453 there are a few bright spots in the manhattan market but in general traffic is way down as is sales activity and marketers are pulling out every trick in the book to try and drive traffic to the sales offices again the ability to negotiate and make deals stands out far and above as the best incentive to get people to purchase the pendulum has clearly swung in favor of the buyers and in my opinion this is actually a great time to buy if someone is looking to purchase and is qualified to do so
3990454 current buyers are not acting immediately and they often come back several times before making decisions this is a large shift in buyer mentality from several years ago when potential buyers moved quickly because they feared that units would sell quickly and prices may go up the market is there but buyers are being cautious and patient as they are looking at many units and projects before signing contracts
3990455 it is a bit different than in the past when buyers would often go out longer and execute contracts based on floor plans and renderings
3990456 as we know that buyers are being more cautious this alteration in market mentality is something that we have had to adjust to we feel though that although the impetuous buyer is no longer around there are buyers who do not have to leverage up to 90 and have the ability and desire to purchase however we are optimistic that good high end units at fair pricing will attract qualified buyers
3990457 sales in williamsburg other parts of brooklyn and queens but above the selling price of 500 000 we are just not finding that
3990458 with regard to getting a mortgage it now takes longer and requires more paperwork yes a purchaser is required to put 25 to 35 of the purchase price down so what so we are back to the way we did business for 30 years its only a shock to those too young to remember
3990459 it is important to note that while 95 end loan financing is not available anymore it has been rare that buyers have leveraged to this extent in our developments while financing is undoubtedly harder it is still available for conservatively leveraged buyers
3990460 on the positive side there are plenty of buyers out there
3990461 every week our agents tell us they have many buyers the issue is they are not buying but hoping to buy or thinking of buying or intending to buy in other words they lack an urgency to act when they get that urgency there will be a flood of buyers as they are waiting in the wings they all want a bargain so unless you can convince them that something is a bargain they dont bite
3990462 the other good news is that bottom fishers are out in force they are everywhere there is no lack of confidence to buy on their part they are relishing the prospect of buying and searching everywhere for bargains it is not a market without buyers a very critical distinction rather it is a market full of buyers who want a bargain and can wait and are waiting thus they waste a lot of time for brokers because they want to see everything and then more of everything and they put in low ball offers that require endless negotiations
3990463 i cannot speak for other projects but our sky view parc condominium development in flushing is doing extremely well we just had a grand opening of a new tower three months ahead of schedule because of popular demand we have sold 15 apartments in the past few weeks alone in the heat of summer to push our project well over 100 sales
3990464 the big question for the following months will be what is the amount of new inventory coming to the market in the fall
3990465 i can say about the current market conditions that apartments are staying longer on the market there is a lower volume of showings per apartment but the people that are out there looking are serious buyers everybody is doing more due diligence and want to see a greater amount of properties
3990466 the manhattan condo market is doing better than other segments of the market because of the great presence of foreign buyers a large number of foreign buyers have been trying for the last five years to buy in the city but they have been priced out of the market now because of the exchange rate and more negotiability they can actually buy the foreign buyers believe in our market and want to have a pied terre or an investment property here we also have new nationalities buying here now russians indians chinese
3990467 we are all exhausted by all of the foreign buyers but they are real they have the money require an adviser and counselor to help them get into the market and they are providing real support for the sales market
3990468 their enthusiasm for our market their confidence in our economy and the america can do spirit their hope in us all drives them to bet their money on people who have been the best hope for mankind in this century we should not forget that they havent and that is why they are here
3990469 i feel sorry for his family because how horrible but also dont you think he is the father of the child
3990470 would he go sneaking into a hotel in the middle of the night to see a child whos not his i dont think so
3990471 he presented himself as this family man who was devoted to his ill wife his little children his older daughter so the hypocrisy of it
3990472 i try not to judge peoples personal lives because you never know whats going on but in this case he so presented himself as something he was not and when your wifes going through cancer treatments i mean geez
3990473 i would be surprised if we can find enough in further savings to cut the rate

3990504 people will not be finding out if the work theyve done is qualified or not for quite some time
3990505 if you pour your concrete and then you walk away thats when the city is going to raise questions
3990506 theres no doubt that there are some people who rushed to get foundations in the ground and are now looking for financing
3990507 there are certainly lenders who are going to say we are not going to finance a project that does not offer a 421 a benefit
3990508 we cant determine whether they are eligible until they complete the project
3990509 if you dont know that youre taking a chance that the numbers youve worked off are not the right numbers
3990510 experienced developers will be for the most part quite capable of being certain that they have qualified
3990511 those that are not certain would be more likely to have less experience and or have legal and architectural representation that is either not of the highest quality or have simply waited too long to get into the ground

3990516 this ruling is about closure and the city and the fire department moving forward together to continue to provide the highest possible levels of public safety for our citizens
3990517 i believe by showing my willingness to move on and live with the arbitrators decision is an important step and i want to call upon everyone in this city to move on and to realize that this issue has been resolved
3990518 in a rebuke of city policy the arbitration panel unanimously agreed that there must be a modification to the citys practice of requiring all firefighters to visit the city physician
3990519 the arbitration panel inserted language to include that the fire chief will have the discretion to challenge a sick leave but must have legitimate reason to challenge it not the citys current interpretation
3990520 theyve been mistreated for such a long period of time
3990521 the city now has 30 days to docket the necessary funds to cover the jlmc award with the board of aldermen we will withhold commenting until we have a chance to the thoroughly review the ruling
3990522 if the mayor really waited 30 days it could be after the sept 2 board meeting til this issue is settled
3990523 we need a new tone with this decision its time to get over the bitterness and begin the healing process
3990524 mayor cohen wants to be certain that every current and retired firefighter receives the money to which they are entitled and until we are clear about how much we need to allocate he believes it would be unwise to docket the financing before the board
3990525 however firefighters can be certain that they will receive the retroactive pay and other benefits that this arbitration ruling calls for

3990531 every year we have a block party this year we had ponies ices clowns everything it was a real carnival
3990532 there used to be a lot of older people but now a lot of families are moving in and theyre from all over the world we have a neighbor from angola and one from argentina there are so many different languages spoken here
3990533 i moved back to new york from los angeles in august 2001 and was looking to buy something
3990534 i put an offer on it but then it was right after september 11 and i had a hard time getting appraisers to even come in and look at it it took seven months to close
3990535 we had to dig about 2 feet down to build the living room
3990536 my husband teases me that ill never be done working on this house but thats what makes it fun isnt it
3990537 you should have seen me driving home from vermont with these huge things sticking out the window
3990538 some of these things cost more than new ones would but i really wanted to keep that old look
3990539 thats the chair i used to rock my baby to sleep
3990540 we have to run around looking for the perfect shade of yellow for the shingles or brown for the steps we all get excited when weve found the right paint colors
3990541 but we have a provisional cessation of hostilities and everyone should be aware that this is considerable progress
3990542 there is no way in good conscience that we could proceed with a joint naval exercise given the state of this crisis
3990543 now that we can walk outside without getting shot youve decided to throw sand back on our heads
3990544 ive been through the emotional process of knowing that i may lose everything ive got
3990545 has the worst reputation of any shelter in the city
3990546 anyone will tell you you do not want to go there
3990547 i have seen people openly shoot heroin shoot crack smoke weed
3990548 to a facility which is so dysfunctional is totally and utterly absurd
3990549 way too much for a residential community anywhere in the city to absorb
3990550 lets fix this shelter for the men who are there now not bring all the men in new york city to a shelter thats clearly broken
3990551 going to be a nightmare from a real estate perspective
3990552 is not a very desirable thing to have to tell a client
3990553 this neighborhood is just starting to come into its own and this could negatively impact it
3990554 nostrand avenue looks like it does primarily because of the shelter
3990555 people dont think that we could support a really good commercial strip we could and were desperate for it but we have this constant onslaught of social services
3990556 i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can if i can do that ill be fine
3990557 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
3990558 and we are aware that the u s is uptight about this project
3990559 but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts
3990560 lets be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that russia and the united states have engaged in on iran or north korea
3990561 america is losing the whole region and this is the region of eastern and central europe
3990562 this is much bigger than any other place where there is american influence and this is the most natural allies of america
3990563 there will be no compromise at the expense of our territorial integrity
3990564 i never accused the united states in the first place of anything
3990565 i just said that the russians mistook some of the statements at certain levels
3990566 i dont think you can have any doubt but that the united states has from the very beginning believed that the south ossetian situation needed to be resolved and resolved peacefully as weve been working for months and months and months to do but that russia seriously overreached that russia engaged in activities that could not possibly be associated simply with the crisis in south ossetia
3990567 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country

3990578 your house isnt worth as much as it used to be the unemployment rate is going up and youre paying more for gas than youve ever paid before
3990579 a lot of crosscurrents are hitting the consumer right now and particularly the discretionary money they have to spend
3990580 there is a feeling of chill in the economic air
3990581 it is bound to be the case there will be a quarter or two of negative growth
3990582 oil prices are at the highest level in real terms at any point in the post war period apart from the late 1970s and weve also seen the biggest financial dislocation since the second world war what is unique is that both shocks have happened at the same time and the combination has meant that life is extremely difficult and will be for the uk economy over the next year
3990583 the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high energy and food prices we know the impact that this is having and will continue to support families and business through these tougher times
3990584 i think its very simple weve been devastated by injuries
3990585 no team ive ever seen in baseball has been decimated like this it would kill any team imagine the red sox without josh beckett and jon lester pitching is 70 of the game chien ming wang won 19 games two straight years chamberlain became the most dominating pitcher in baseball you cant lose two guys like that
3990586 i always said that every tournament counts for me that i enter

3990590 the 1 500 gold medal would be amazing thats the one ive been dreaming about since 2005
3990591 it would mean my career has been really successful and i would be very satisfied
3990592 the 5 000 is not my event and theres too many laps there for me
3990593 the 1 500 is my priority and i want to treat that one as if its the only hard race im doing
3990594 when the american national anthem is played i feel enormous pride the same way i felt when the kenyan anthem was played
3990595 my loyalty is for the country im representing right now and that is the united states i dont feel any shame i dont feel any regrets im just really happy to see the flag being raised for something i have done
3990596 the ibaf has been advised of a possible anti doping rule violation by a player from the taiwan team
3990597 as a result the player chang tai shan has been provisionally suspended pending the analysis of the b sample and a formal hearing
3990598 we learned about the news yesterday afternoon and it is very regrettable
3990599 i have already notified all the players on our team and told them that since now we only have 23 players we should give an even better performance during the games
3990600 i feel today they did their job and did a good job
3990601 the medications are not illegal but theyre banned for olympics athletes
3990602 im not clear on what happened im not a doctor
3990603 last week we didnt have a track and we didnt have a field but now everything is in place
3990604 this is one of the hottest 100s in history there hasnt been as much hype about it for a long time
3990605 everyone was disappointed but we came into this game with the right mentality but it was just too difficult and we had some tough luck
3990606 we were very close three days ago to putting our stamp on international soccer
3990607 even tonight we were very close again even we play with 10 men we never give up we still play good soccer

3990611 obviously theyre world class players and we expect nothing less they step on the court and every open opportunity they had they executed we set up shots great we had the rallies going we couldnt convert
3990612 we were just playing a game and they just didnt make any mistake you know i mean everybody makes mistakes and it takes them a while
3990613 we just had confidence that we can hang with these guys and its just too bad that the score didnt show
3990614 i wouldnt call it bad sportsmanship but they just wanted everything and wouldnt give anything
3990615 at least they didnt know how to speak english it was just chinese they couldnt bad mouth us
3990616 i really wanted him to come and watch me play because he missed out on athens and this might be my last olympics sorry dad

3990633 i am excited about this chance to showcase some of the initiatives we launched here in virginia and the results we achieved in our effort to help people compete in a changing economy
3990634 barack obamas natural base is not the business community yet probably there is no democrat more respected by american business leadership than mark warner

3990637 there are a lot of exciting things happening in this space
3990638 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
3990639 the us stands with the democratically elected government of georgia insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3990640 we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3990641 very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
3990642 any civilised country would act same way i may remind you that on september 11 2001 the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction

3990651 ironically while the seldom voters were the most likely to be mobilized by campaign communication they were the least likely to be contacted

3990657 the number of new restaurants in dallas county also increased by 22 percent definitely an indicator of healthy growth
3990658 as with any business restaurants that are able to adapt quickly to changing economic and business trends are better able to weather difficult times those who are able to do so without passing large increased costs onto the customer will survive this economic wave as well
3990659 while it is devastating to see some who have had to close their doors the greater dallas restaurant association texas restaurant association and national restaurant association are working together to bolster and support the restaurant industry from lobbying congress to instituting policies that do not force our needs for food and fuel to compete against each other to implementing educational and marketing initiatives at the local restaurant level their goal is to do whatever they can to assist restaurants in successfully managing the economic and business challenges during this time

3990662 with violence escalating the troubled state of jammu and kashmir is again at the brink of catastrophe

3990672 if the senate does conduct an additional review it is essential its terms of reference are broad ranging to achieve real outcomes for indigenous australians
3990673 we have to take the politics out of this debate
3990674 in order to achieve a lasting impact a review by the senate would need to consider historical funding arrangements for indigenous services since 1978
3990675 it would need to assess the backlog in health education housing and infrastructure and determine whether commonwealth funding support is adequate

3990679 maar 7 procent van de 29 000 werklozen in de bouw volgen een voor hen georganiseerde opleiding
3990680 daarom moet de werkloosheidsvergoeding in de eerste maanden hoog zijn en nadien een duidelijke terugval kennen
3990681 our worldwide presence means we are already able to compensate for fluctuating business cycles in individual markets
3990682 the growing worldwide shortage of raw materials and the resulting energy problems are actually a big opportunity for us that is precisely the target area of our resources segment we can help to exploit reserves of raw materials thanks to our new deep level drilling rigs and specialized knowledge in operations for deep mines and we can profit from the investment backlog for infrastructure projects such as the construction of power stations

3990695 with mobile phone usage growing its logical for more companies to seek mobile marketing as a way to reach their segmented targets in this direct and highly interactive medium
3990696 these findings indicate the degree to which the mobile phone is used as a marketing channel with enhanced handsets and flat rate data tariffs increasingly common it is only a matter of time before mobile internet advertising starts to rival the penetration of sms or text message marketing

3990728 were just seeing enormous traffic record levels that weve frankly never seen before
3990729 there isnt an event like the olympics in terms of offering viewer choice and we know from previous games that nothing drives red button usage the way the olympics does in 2004 the first interactive olympics we did we had more than 10 million people go interactive just on the satellite platform thats more than double the next most popular event the bbcs ever done wimbledon with about four million more than anything we can do whether its glastonbury or another sports event the olympics gets people looking on interactive tv
3990730 we are not a commercial organisation nbc are that may be why theyve chosen to hold back some of their content from the web for us its all about universal access we want universal reach were not about making money we just want more and more people to access the games in however many ways they want to there arent any limitations for us im sure they have very different considerations
3990731 the ioc are among the most stringent in sports rights when it comes to digital platforms and we have a very strict arrangement with them that our content must not leak outside the uk
3990732 thats really for the ioc thats their role to monitor and see what happens
3990733 these games are slightly antisocial happening when most people in the country are either in bed or in work the opportunities for people to just sit in front of the telly all day waiting for the action arent as obvious as athens when it was a european timezone they need to get a fix of the action wherever they are that means we need to offer them a really strong on demand service and make sure we make the live action available wherever they are

3990740 the way the geographical data is presented and the platforms it is going to connect with must be taken into consideration
3990741 companies may want to use the data for other software in areas such as customer services and renewals so integration must be carried out with caution as completely standalone outputs could create issues such as having to do manual lists and manage duplication
3990742 when companies are managing risk of crime related to a property location wrong use of data could have an adverse effect such as affecting house prices

3990834 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3990835 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3990836 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3990837 only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
3990838 the very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
3990839 the georgian leadership is a special project for the united states
3990840 at some time it will be necessary to choose between supporting this virtual project and real partnership on questions which actually require collective action
3990841 very clear eyed about his relationship with the russian leaders
3990842 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
3990843 it is simply not a requirement of this mission and it is not something we are seeking to do

3990845 contrary to their previous reports european election observers said voting fraud took place during georgias recent election that returned president saakashvili to power opposition groups plan to continue protests the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce which sent election observers to georgia initially said the jan 5 presidential vote met international standards but problems with the election continue to surface
3990846 they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights
3990847 but facing this brutal invading army whose violence was ripping georgia apart our government decided to withdraw from south ossetia declare a cease fire and seek negotiations yet moscow ignored our appeal for peace our repeated attempts to contact senior russian leaders were rebuffed russias foreign ministry even denied receiving our notice of cease fire hours after it was officially and very publicly delivered this was just one of many cynical ploys to deceive the world and justify further attacks

3990854 the first defendant and the second defendant were notified of the listing today
3990855 it would appear at this stage there is no appearance
3990856 i definitely wasnt going to make the same mistake i made four years ago where i took the preliminaries too easy its been eating at me for a long time so to go out and accomplish a medal is really exciting it doesnt top the relay medal but its something ive been pushing for for years
3990857 so thats what im going to be focusing on over the next three days
3990858 the next few days will be all about getting as much rest as i can thats going to be the key
3990859 i feel better than last night i had 24 hours to recover but i feel good the race was a bit tiring but thats what i train for i feel a lot better compared with the 400 im physically
3990860 well it was really fortunate to be in the first heat with britta steffen germany and libby trickett australia and have such a good heat to judge myself off of

3990862 he mendis is a bit different and the batsmen need some time to settle in we have to be positive but ultimately it comes down to how we play him in the middle
3990863 its tough to say anything right now but we know what he have to do we know our abilities and are quite confident
3990864 after a long time we have two match winning spinners we now have more attacking options
3990865 murali has now got the support he needs and there is also support for vaas its quite a relief for a captain to have such an option in mendis for us it is always a team game
3990866 we are not complacent because we know the one dayers are a very different game we are confident with the way we are playing and have to make sure we execute our plans as we did in the tests
3990867 it is always difficult to replace him tendulkar as he contributes not only with his batting and bowling but also comes out with brilliant suggestions

3990873 hes coming into his own hes a stud im glad hes on our team i wouldnt want to face him you just look at those six inning starts alone and you see that consistency thats a stud
3990874 hes been just outstanding for us and he was again tonight
3990875 honestly to me its just going out there and doing my job
3990876 its not about having a breakout season or anything i put the pressure on myself to be successful
3990877 well my goal is to pitch better than the night before
3990878 hopefully everyone will pick it up and outdo me nothing would be better than that
3990879 the left side of their infield is really alert because hes throwing sinkers and changeups
3990880 hes been great lately but he got some defensive help and they turned some double plays
3990881 i really just wanted to go deeper in the game and the strikeouts get my pitch count up
3990882 i think its just a matter of mixing pitches and letting the defense make the plays i went right after them and stayed ahead the home runs those happen i just kept pitching
3990883 my power is to center and thats where youre going to see me hit here
3990884 i know this park is great for lefties who pull but thats not my game

3990887 hes the greatest olympian in the world and hell be able to earn money everywhere as hes an international brand
3990888 hes a billion dollar man he wont have to get a job ever he can live off this for 50 years
3990889 in the heat and intensity of this event it may seem that his earning power is limitless but you have to pull back and look at someone like tiger woods who has performed at a top level for years and years in front of the world
3990890 the olympics is only held once every four years after a year to so americans forget about the olympics and move to stars they see more kids want someone else on their weetabix box
3990891 you need to be out there early and establish your affiliation with the property michael phelps
3990892 his performance here will benefit us as it will add to the visibility we will get through this affiliation and his earning ability will increase theres no question of that
3990893 in the short term he is a gold mine because he represents everything that is pure young strong and visionary about america we havent had anyone of this significance since mark spitz
3990894 guaranteed there will be marketers wanting a piece of him that make no sense and it will interesting to see how his handlers cope with this and if they get greedy because the olympics has a narrow avenue of marketability
3990895 all happy people are grateful ungrateful people cannot be happy we tend to think that being unhappy leads people to complain but it is truer to say that complaining leads to people becoming unhappy

3990956 people need to be waking up to the realities of the world and that the days of easy money have come to a pretty sudden end
3990957 there is an awful lot of talk about big transfers and major demands of players but you will find throughout the uk and europe that money is not quite as easy to obtain as it used to be
3990958 were expecting the levels of transfer fees this summer to still to be quite high but probably not as high as the record that was set last summer
3990959 euro 2008 happened towards the start of the summer transfer window
3990960 the level of transfer activity at the start of a window sometimes decreases when there is a major tournament taking place
3990961 another factor is that the 2008 09 season is the second year of a three year broadcast deal and the level of broadcasting revenues to clubs this year will be broadly similar to what they received last year
3990962 so were not seeing a step change in the amount of revenues that clubs are getting year on year
3990963 another point is weve not seen anything like the number of changes in club ownership in the last 12 months compared to the previous 12 months
3990964 there arent several new owners of premier league clubs for whom this window is their first opportunity to buy and sell players so i think thats another factor

3990973 i am not but a pilgrim headed for the holy city of jerusalem
3990974 ah a fellow pilgrim i should have guessed when i saw that look in your eye
3990975 they are my companions on my road we too are headed to jerusalem by way of constantinople then by ship to the coast and then inland by what road do you go
3990976 tell me is this your first time to the city
3990977 it is but from what i have heard tell there is trouble on my heals i have heard that the crusaders are on the move again and the templar knights are swelling their ranks i hear even ahura is on the move again
3990978 indeed i have heard of the templars but to hear tell of ahura that is an omen indeed
3990979 since this is your first time and my second i offer to act as guide to you and all in your company as a fellow pilgrim there is no charge or course
3990980 before i answer what kind of pilgrim are you one who seeks to aid such troubles or one who would avert them
3990981 i am a pilgrim of peace as i have always been and always will be
3990982 in that case i am alone and help would be much appreciated which vessel is yours
3990983 do not worry master sam we are simple pilgrims to this fellow as long as we keep your brothers quiet to the truth we will be nothing more
3990984 it is all that they say it is perhaps more it will be a shame to see trouble come to it again
3990985 i at least will answer the call if it is offered me
3990986 i am but even those who seek peace may need to take up the sword every now and again it seems to be the way of things these days

3990991 the digitalism is a movement towards the future with a powerful memory of the past as we approach the new millennium we are filled with the anticipation of a new global awareness we do firmly believe and so strongly state that the new art dwells not so much in the artifact that hosts it but in the concept that molds it thanks to technology our art all art can be universally enjoyed and eternally preserved art as ever springs from the mind and the heart of the artist whatever their subject matter whatever their means to the end it remains an expansive personal experience for both the creator and the viewer
3990992 i apologized to him and i apologized to my teammates
3990993 i told him that hes one of our leaders here and theres no reason for that
3990994 weve got pitchers who can do that to the other team too
3990995 they do that to us why cant we do that to them
3990996 you have to live with that stuff its been around since the beginning of the game
3990997 it was either incorporate or be swallowed up by streamwood and forever lose their identity

3990999 i look at this as a new beginning a celebration of who we are and what we represent
3991000 this must be an age of restoration restoring the natural resources of this country so that the younger generation will not inherit a country in which the air is filled with smog the water is polluted and our parks are desolate because we didnt do the right planning
3991001 for many years people looked at us as a bedroom community but were continuing to build and improve
3991002 weve evolved into a community of great diversity a place where people can afford to bring their families
3991003 i think the cost is justified to bring some pride to our community
3991004 it was unlike anything the village has experienced in recent history
3991005 karl was a truly unique individual who willingly shared with me his knowledge of the chicago dental society and provided counsel and guidance whenever needed

3991010 i do not think either one of the craigs like the way things in the village are going
3991011 shes been a model of dedication and leadership and caring thats what i see
3991012 never forget that you are here to meet the needs of the people of hanover park
3991013 i expect there will be no need for anyone to call me sir so you might as well get used to calling me by my first name sam
3991014 and it is well for you to come in such haste
3991015 so your mother still lives i had hoped it was so
3991016 rise my dear friend and teacher and please call me by my first name
3991017 of course master sam you have grown into a strong young man since last we met now tell me why have you sent for me
3991018 no need for that sir ill send for one of the servants to retrieve them
3991019 come master ahura sit next to me sam told everything truly
3991020 it is but i have to take it in such large amounts now that it is almost not worth doing things have been going steadily downhill ever since i lost the use of my legs
3991021 but paul is unwilling to learn he knows of no reason to learn such skills as i have to teach besides if you dont mind me saying so he has become what your father feared a brat
3991022 we are old friends master you know well that you can tell me anything
3991023 there is always a calm before the storm it is no different with war and i doubt that it shall ever change i just wish i had seen it coming
3991024 peaceful times call for such things i suppose all a warrior like me can do is wait and hope for something to do pity there are no battles to fight or uprisings to put down so the tides of war ebb and i must ebb with them
3991025 i understand that elizabeth is now of age and two years older than the marrying age still i do not like this one remember not all suitors are as fair as they seem
3991026 but he is a colannas and the only heir designate
3991027 i never said we shouldnt i merely suggest that we should not go with the first one
3991028 we know of one of your errands pray tell us the other
3991029 now then you say you wish my daughters hand in marriage i say that you are bold in this perhaps too bold i propose a test if you pass then you may court my daughter if you wish if you dont then you may not
3991030 you think your reputation will scare me i tell you it wont you are old youve lived your glory days now you will be discarded like the useless thing you are
3991031 perhaps he is not as incapable as i thought still that was a lucky shot
3991032 mother you know master is toying with the poor boy right
3991033 we worship the spirit divine all wisdom and goodness possessing surrounded by holy immortals the givers of bounty and blessing we joy in the works of his hands his truth and his power confessing we praise all the things that are pure for these are his only creation the thoughts that are true and the words and deeds that have won approbation these are supported by him and for these we make adoration
3991034 i am not one to make guesses to the reason
3991035 id wager that a large group of mohammedans has been moving closer to one of the major cities out there you were asked to act as an emissary however you met with more resistance than expected and were forced to return home
3991036 how else would you have acquired that yataghan of yours
3991037 this isnt some idle whim of fredricks mothers sisters aunts second cousin twice removed
3991038 he must go with us you know hes the only one here who has been beyond the manor as lord of this manor you must go and since i am being called directly elizabeth must also go
3991039 he must continue his training i will be responsible for him besides it is high time he took a pilgrimage anyway
3991040 if the lemonbalm is barely working then she is far beyond my abilities ive seen some horrific cases recently but this is by far the worst i recommend that you get yourselves to the citeaux monastery as soon as possible
3991041 my god that thing is no monastery its a castle
3991042 it is a perfect example of a self contained monastery
3991043 ah so you must be the weapons master master sam was talking about
3991044 as im sure you are aware she cant move her legs and can barely move her arms
3991045 ah she hasnt been able to move her legs for quite some time now and now the disease seems to be moving up her body
3991046 ive been praying master i get no answer why doesnt he answer me
3991047 i know that but it is just so hard to lose the only parent youve ever known
3991048 its just that ever since that episode youve changed so i hope that doesnt mean that youve lost your faith
3991049 dont worry my dear abbot id never turn my back completely on those who raised me but some of the other monks believe otherwise
3991050 i thought you said that you never knew my parents
3991051 it is good that all you have come it gladdens me to see so many familiar faces as i am sure you all have guessed i have called you together to discuss the increasing mohammedan problems before we begin id like master ahura to recount the taking of antioch during the first crusade
3991052 my name is pier della vigne i am a minister to caesar fredrick ii it seems to me that now that the work of claiming jerusalem is finished it is only a matter of dealing with the people who are causing the problem may i suggest that we send a small force to jerusalem and remove the mohammedans
3991053 this council hears you master della vigne and your suggestion shall be taken under advisement
3991054 it is time for the afternoon meal let us adjourn for now and take this question up after we have eaten
3991055 my friends it is obvious that we must do something i say while the mohammedans are a problem we cannot just go there and kill every single one of them as one of the veterans who fought against them before and survived i say that we send a small party to act as ambassadors and if that does not work we can just do what we did before we were able to drive them before us once we can probably do it again
3991056 but master how many times have you said that violence should be the last resort
3991057 they have not openly done any act of violence to any christian yet
3991058 then as my vassal i say desist in these attempts and try to find another way
3991059 and as your teacher and weapons master i say that to find another way i go to jerusalem
3991060 i pope innocent iii say that the result of this assize at mounte casino is hereby ended do not listen to any pope in rome
3991061 i agree that the mohammedans are a problem but i shall only give aide if the patriarchs of constantinople antioch and jerusalem request it
3991062 tell my sister that i give her complete rule over the manor until i return
3991063 weve needed food and we did ask politely you know that
3991064 i also know that once one settlement is attacked word travels and others will turn the aggressor away besides we have enough food if we ration it
3991065 you must be willing to set an example for the lower classes if you want them to do anything
3991066 i cannot believe that you are willing to lower yourself like that it just goes to show that your family isnt from a noble line
3991067 my mother was willing to spare your life but after such an insult i may not be willing to do the same
3991068 none of you have any justifiable reason to claim it
3991069 i wager bernard hasnt even been in a real fight
3991070 all we can do now is avoid bernards company whenever possible
3991071 tell me are there any living on that cart of yours
3991072 sorry sir i was just sayin that it isnt up to you to finish the task but you arent free to desist from it either
3991073 damn my reputation really does precede me even all the way out here i really have got to go into retirement or something maybe a quiet hermitage or something
3991074 perhaps ill do that but i wouldnt be so fast to call yourself an idiot if i were you
3991075 avoid the company of deluded people when you can when you cannot keep your own council
3991076 it is not yours to finish a task nor are you free to desist from it
3991077 victory creates hatred defeat creates suffering those who are wise strive for nether victory no defeat
3991078 ik heb vijftien jaar bij de gemeente roosendaal gewerkt daar was ik onder meer verantwoordelijk voor de organisatie van de kermissen in de gemeente op een gegeven moment werd ik gedetacheerd bij de gemeente helmond om ook daar de kermis te regelen zo is het balletje gaan rollen
3991079 de autoscooters bijvoorbeeld een draaimolen nogakraam en touwtrekspel dat zijn vaste waarden oosterhout heeft zelf karakteristieke attracties die hier niet kunnen ontbreken de hobbelende geit bijvoorbeeld de golvende draaimolen waarbij je kwastje kunt trekken voor een gratis ritje red dat hoort echt bij oosterhout
3991080 omdat oosterhout zich profileert als familiestad proberen we ook een echte familiekermis neer te zetten we willen graag veel attracties waar niet alleen de kinderen in kunnen maar waar gezinnen samen in kunnen stappen papa en mama moeten mee de attractie in kunnen dat is trouwens niet alleen leuker voor de ouders maar ook gunstig voor kermisexploitanten met een attractie waarbij meer gezinsleden mee kunnen doen verkoopt die ook meer kaartjes
3991081 ook spectaculaire attracties zijn belangrijk die heb je nodig voor de beeldvorming attracties die over kop gaan die alle kanten op draaien behalve de goede groot hoog spektakel springt er uit ook dat hoort bij de kermis
3991082 want wij leggen dan wel de basis voor de kermis de bezoekers moeten er een succes van maken
3991083 vaak probeer ik in de zomermaanden al attracties vast te leggen voor de kermissen van het jaar daarna
3991084 dan ga ik bijvoorbeeld in tilburg vast kijken naar bijzondere attracties voor de oosterhoutse kermis van het jaar erop er moeten elk jaar dingen zijn die er niet eerder waren
3991085 we leggen de inschrijvingen en de wensen van de gemeente daarna naast elkaar om een selectie te kunnen maken we proberen voor ieder wat wils weg te zetten
3991086 deze week zijn we puur bezig met de uitvoering op straat met witte hoekjes uitzetten wie precies waar moet komen te staan volgens de gemaakte tekeningen zorgen dat de stroomvoorziening in orde is de camping voor de exploitanten in orde maken verlichting plaatsen wegen afzetten borden plaatsen
3991087 dat varieert van wethouders die toestemming moeten geven voor bepaalde zaken tot mensen van de buitendienst communicatiemedewerkers en de mannen van de elektriciteit
3991088 het zal raar zijn om straks pieter niet meer bij iedere training in het bad te zien
3991089 maar hij moet nog aftrainen dus we komen elkaar nog vaak tegen pas als de meiden hem voorbij gaan zwemmen is hij echt klaar
3991090 ik ben hier niet om te jammeren nu ga ik door ook
3991091 ik ben teleurgesteld ja we hadden een ander scenario in gedachten
3991092 er vloog van alles in het rond dus ik ben de eerste tien minuten maar een beetje uit de buurt gebleven
3991093 dat is terecht hij wilde maar n ding en dat is niet gelukt dat moet er dan even uit en dat siert hem als sportman
3991094 onze droom was drie keer goud halen op de 100 meter vrij dat werd de laatste tijd moeilijker en moeilijker maar we zijn er toch voor gegaan en kwamen er dicht bij tegelijkertijd waren we ook ver weg
3991095 the kind of language he uses and the kind of behavior he exhibits in the public domain toward women objectifies them and
3991096 christ matthews helped to destroy delicate hillary clintons fragile shot at the presidency
3991097 hillary clinton bugs a lot of guys i mean really bugs people
3991098 shes looking down on me what do you think howie shes looking down on me that woman she thinks shes better than me
3991099 this way i see progress so i dont mess up the part ive done
3991100 keep records and spreadsheets that are easily updated and make sure to back this info up on cds or flash drives
3991101 bathrooms are high traffic areas with lots of visibility when working with a small space a little money goes a long way
3991102 river rock ceramic glass stone clay recycled materials and metals in metallic pastel earth tones tiles with lots of facial activity mosaic designs square and rectangle
3991103 a fabulous way to use tile is as an accent
3991104 surrounding a mirror with tile offers just enough interest to be sophisticated without being overdone
3991105 people personalize this space like a tattoo creating a custom look
3991106 this is a fantastic option to incorporate tile in a chic way
3991107 use black and white tiles at the top bottom or through the middle of the wall to create a checkerboard look
3991108 with small penny tiles be generous with the grout and use a contrasting color think black grout with white tiles or white grout with black tiles
3991109 overuse can result in a room that is busy and overdone
3991110 if the bathroom is small stay light or dark keep the colors all the same in a really small space
3991111 its best to keep trendy colors as accents so you dont have to re do if the colors become dated or out of style
3991112 ceramic is cost effective comes in a wide range of sizes shapes colors and finishes and its the most durable
3991113 when done all over this look comes off too industrial but when used as an accent or border around a tub or as a countertop it can be really pretty
3991114 certainly the setup of the kitchen has a lot to do with the quality of the food if its a difficult kitchen to work in so much so that it stresses you out to cook you might make some compromises about what youre doing
3991115 everyone knows the kitchen triangle our kitchen sink should be close to our refrigerator and our stove should be close to our sink
3991116 the biggest thing is being able to access your refrigerator and your cabinets if your food storage is open and easy to reach you will minimize time and frustration if your ingredients are hard to get to and it takes more time clearing a space to cook then it will be all too easy to grab something that is not as healthy
3991117 every time i look at a bridal registry i see the same thing some really high end pots and pans that are aluminum lined and copper core
3991118 really how often does the home cook need to deglaze
3991119 get yourself a set of high end non stick cookware one the cleanup is much easier so you are more apt to cook two you dont need as much fat to keep things from sticking
3991120 a pressure cooker significantly cuts down on the amount of time it takes to cook whole grains which have more nutrients
3991121 at first people are really intimidated but once they realize how quickly they can get meals together they really embrace it
3991122 there is nothing easier to make than a smoothie and with great ingredients your recipe choices are endless
3991123 a lot of people stay away from buying fruits and vegetables because they go bad so quickly and they end up throwing them out
3991124 everyone has crispers in refrigerators but they differ depending on the unit some preserve fruits and vegetable better than others
3991125 keeping non refrigerated counter safe fresh fruits and vegetables on the counter will instantly sway your appetite toward healthier food choices as you walk into your kitchen if you see them you will use them
3991126 people are creatures of habit if they see them they will appreciate them and use them more often
3991127 when it comes to cooking healthy it comes down to one truth your kitchen must be convenient
3991128 i have been in some kitchens that i felt i needed a ph d just to turn anything on
3991129 you spend a fortune redoing your kitchen and then dont use it because you dont want to clean up the messy pots and pans
3991130 you have to understand them rather than ask them to understand you you need to understand what kind of situation they are in and what you can ask of them
3991131 you start with the easy things and make it more difficult and repeat and repeat thats another kind of patience you have to have otherwise you cant do it
3991132 the biggest reason i did that is my eye capacity when you get old you cannot judge the distance at high speed and your riding gets slower and slower
3991133 i wasnt qualified as a rider because of my age
3991134 if that makes me a little bit more famous than the others then thats not so bad
3991135 if somebody hears what i am doing or if what i am doing helps to motivate him or her that will be nice
3991136 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3991137 i dont think john mccain has really made his case to hunters and anglers
3991138 things were very different in 2004 everybody knew that george w bush was from texas he was a rancher and that he went hunting we havent seen that from mccain the unknown he really needs to come out as a sportsman
3991139 neither candidate has talked a lot about the issues that are important to us
3991140 there was a verbal agreement of 7 000 cash for the bobcat and the customer showed up with the cash and found out it was actually a robbery ambush
3991141 he was in fear for his life he felt that he was going to be shot and killed and he actually did pull his gun and shot several times at the robber
3991142 elevate these criminals to a level of sophistication they very likely do not possess
3991143 that means that youll sync less and get the data you care about faster than before this will be a plus for everyone but will especially benefit edge users and those with spotty connections

3991148 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3991149 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
3991150 political stability in my view can only be brought through a reconciliation approach as opposed to confrontation
3991151 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3991152 all our fruit went down the jhelum valley into west punjab which is now in pakistan that was always the natural road and river route and low transport costs meant that our fruit farmers got a good price but now we have been cut off from our natural trade routes and consumers instead we have been forced to cross the pir panjal range into jammu and the gangetic plain this route is fraught with logistical difficulties high costs and longer distances so kashmiri fruit growers get a lower price for their produce
3991153 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3991154 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3991155 we are deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation which is resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people we call for immediate steps to end violence against innocent kashmiris
3991156 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3991157 my address will be incomplete if i dont speak about what is happening in srinagar or indian held kashmir i know and all of you know as well that in the past few days 22 innocent civilians have died including sheikh abdul aziz i condemn this act of human rights violation there is no doubt that every pakistani is with their brothers and sisters in kashmir on this occasion i have no doubt that kashmir beats in the heart of every pakistani and that kashmir runs through pakistans veins therefore every pakistani is with the people of kashmir

3991160 intel and jajah have a common objective to deploy technology building blocks that deliver a richer communication experience for consumers

3991165 hace mucho tiempo que la gente en m xico ha padecido las penurias de las costosas llamadas de larga distancia debido a que los mexicanos viajan y van a vivir a otros lugares del mundo mucha gente tiene conocidos viviendo en otros pa ses todos quieren estar en contacto con sus amigos y parientes pero hasta ahora no todos pod an darse el lujo de hacerlo
3991166 jajah direct es una soluci n que funciona para todos no s lo para los versados en tecnolog a cualquier persona sabe c mo usar un tel fono y ahora sabe que los tel fonos se pueden usar para llamadas de larga distancia a bajo costo
3991167 for too long people in mexico have suffered under the strain of costly long distance calls as mexicans travel and relocate around the world most people now know people living in other countries everyone wants to keep in touch with these friends and family but until now not everyone could afford it
3991168 jajah direct is a solution that works for everyone not just the techy people everyone knows how to use a phone and now that phone can be used to make low cost long distance calls

3991181 maccas going to take over the record this week and im more than happy to hand it over
3991182 he has been a great player for the adelaide football club and hopefully therell be more indigenous guys to reach the 300 game milestone in years to come because lets face it its a pretty hard achievement
3991183 hopefully its just one of those years where theyve had to find out who can play and who cant play
3991184 the young guys probably dropped off the pace a little bit this year a few injuries didnt help
3991185 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3991186 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating
3991187 now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3991188 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3991189 i feel for sure ive made 100 per cent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3991190 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3991191 i find it a little bit ridiculous that were playing maybe 11 matches in seven days to be honest
3991192 i know it rained the first day but quite honestly i dont understand why we dont play such a big tournament over 10 days maybe
3991193 thats the only regret i have at the moment because i think this is asking just a little bit too much and too much trouble
3991194 theyve made it very hard on us players and i wish there were extra days for us to play
3991195 i know the difficulty of trying to win a medal here
3991196 its a difficult forum winning six matches in seven days plus five doubles matches if you want to win gold there as well
3991197 except in dubai in practice i never have to towel off basically after every point i play
3991198 the racquet gets wet grip gets wet slippery that makes it hard just having the proper feeling on the grip

3991201 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3991202 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3991203 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3991204 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3991205 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3991206 unfortunately lukes knee blew up afterwards was worse again this morning and the scan has then revealed the bad news
3991207 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3991208 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3991209 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3991210 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3991211 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3991212 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3991213 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3991214 although we learnt a lot during the operation we have not yet found the exact cause of the pansteatitis that has caused the deaths of so many crocodiles in this river system
3991215 just sort of playing the odds one of the common things that we see in ontario in the summertime particularly with water birds is botulism
3991216 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3991217 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3991228 does he do all the hard yakka and then finds himself handing the side over to a higher profile coach in 2011 that would be grossly unfair
3991229 he is an outstanding young bloke and i sincerely hope he has the chance to coach an afl side
3991230 he understands the game and he understands people and i believe some really good player struggle to impart their knowledge to people who may not be as skilled and i say that because they really dont understand what natural ability is
3991231 but guy is a bloke that understands the game but can impart how to get that across to a young player as opposed to saying he should automatically have it

3991237 the ibm hci study clearly calls for the same rigor in talent analytics and management that ceos and cios require to make the strategic decisions their companies depend on
3991238 the challenge laid out for ibms clients is to treat their most valuable asset their people as their most competitive edge
3991239 the long term payoffs of strong talent management far outweigh the costs and complexities associated with upfront investments
3991240 this research proves that in todays increasingly globalized technology driven economy a strategic and integrated focus on talent can in fact help your organization prepare for corporate adolescence and financially outperform competitors no matter the size or industry

3991254 the agricultural teachers own pet rabbit wilma was kept in the yard and she had her unborn babies cut out of her belly i cant believe there are such sickos living in our community
3991255 for these animals to have suffered and been tortured and dismembered it is like something out of a horror movie
3991256 they were basically mutilated and spread around in the compound where the animals are
3991257 obviously the college community is disgusted and disappointed at whats happened anybody who can take advantage of defenceless animals that are being cared for by our students is quite disappointing

3991270 the central theme of this years summer privacy symposium is privacy in transition after four decades of privacy balances organizational policies and legal regulatory systems geared to successive waves of computer and telecommunication applications by businesses and government and then the net 1 0 environment many observers believe we have entered a dramatic new information environment this arises from a combination of developments such as net 2 0 technology personal mobile communication devices the social networking and online self revelation revolution an increasingly voyeuristic media and blogger world continuous data breaches and a global identity theft enterprise the shrinkage of public places anonymity adoption of online behavioral marketing and concerns over various homeland security surveillance measures how these developments are unfolding whether they can be handled effectively by adaptations of the 1970 2004 privacy systems or whether democratic nations will need to develop a new privacy framework will be the symposiums key issues

3991291 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks
3991292 the relationship between russia and the west is long and complicated there have been many turning points for good and ill this is another turning point let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past

3991311 this is another significant contract win and augments our order book which at the end of june was already 32 per cent ahead of 12 months ago
3991312 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3991313 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3991314 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3991315 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3991316 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3991317 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3991321 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3991322 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3991323 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3991324 the seven americans were sent back to los angeles and should be arriving shortly
3991325 oh wii are you going to go home to play with yourself
3991326 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3991327 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3991328 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3991329 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3991330 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3991331 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3991332 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3991333 they were ambushed and murdered at 10 30 in the morning by numerous armed gunmen and it was very very fast
3991334 they were absolutely committed passionate caring and highly effective workers and they were purely on a humanitarian mission

3991337 there were no signs of trauma and no readily apparent marks or injuries that would lead us to make any assumptions as to the cause of her death
3991338 i think its mainly the pain she was in and the lack of mobility as to why she didnt get out of the house much
3991339 apparently nichi likes to visit watery areas we just wanted to eliminate the possibility she could have fallen back there or is laying down back there
3991340 yet many of the aspects of why a shotgun is utilized in standard defense do not apply to the undead which is why the shotgun should not be the preferred method of anti zombie weaponry
3991341 top 5 reasons you should not use a shotgun for zombie defense
3991342 secondly a shotgun does not need to be precisely on target to hit the target since it throws out a number of projectiles
3991343 your first order of business is to escape not fight especially if you are on your own firing your weapon should be your last resort and only if spotted since the report of the weapon will draw more
3991344 second if this is based on the average person they cant aim the spread of a shot gun makes aiming obsolete
3991345 just point at the head and pull the trigger baby
3991346 the only way to defeat is to band together and you need to use all sorts of tools to let your human presence be known as well as seeking out other humans barricading yourself in your room is in hopes that some group will eventually defeat the zombies and youll be safe a real american will be part of the group that hunts and defeats the zombies
3991347 i have always wondered if a flame thorougher may be more effective than any gun a garden sprayer filled with kerosene and a lighter may work better at least if your outside with nothing to burn but zombies and you can get them in any country
3991348 one should always carry a samurai sword for quick beheadings
3991349 i would want a 9mm because thats what all the gangstas use
3991350 the only weapon guaranteed to put a permanent hurt on the zombies is a full auto aa 12
3991351 you ladies ought to consider that when our ancestors faced the rise of the living dead they had no firearms whatsoever

3991353 im very happy i performed so well in my first olympic final sullivan said
3991354 unfortunately it wasnt good enough i probably used a little more energy than i should have in the first 50 meters i gave 100 percent and it wasnt good enough
3991355 it was out of my hands one of those things i couldnt control so i dont worry about it
3991356 then all of a sudden the tables turn so you cant really go off that i have no regrets
3991357 he bush is an incredible athlete and i wish him the best
3991358 i try to block that out of my mind as far as thinking how close i was to being a texan
3991359 thats two years in the past i dont think about that im focused on bigger and better things right now

3991361 he has a long career ahead of him all the best to him
3991362 i know im far from it i know theres a lot of hard work focus determination and patience involved
3991363 its a learning experience any time youre a rookie coming into this league and youre a first round draft pick you have a lot of pressure on your shoulders its not an easy job
3991364 those first two years i didnt have a lot of highlight plays i had a few but theyre hard to come by in this league those guys on the other side of the football are as good as you are so theyre harder to come by
3991365 its a totally different level from college you start at rock bottom once you get in the league some people are able to come into this league and have great careers right off the bat some people have to learn everybodys different
3991366 the way i am stuff like that doesnt affect me much
3991367 whether its good or bad i appreciate it but you cant buy into it
3991368 i realized that what i did before wasnt good enough
3991369 i dont really care what other people have to say the biggest thing for me is trying to get better for my team and help us get where we want to be thats the only thing that motivates me

3991380 i think the lower price has attracted buyers into the market given the extreme volatility of the gold price in recent days i think picking the near term direction is very difficult
3991381 i think gold has been principally driven by investor activity and the us dollar movement has been an important influence on gold
3991382 definitely theres a bit of bargain hunting but i dont think we are out of golds decline yet resistance should be around 836 and then 845 the downside of course will still be around the 800s

3991398 this year i really learned how to plan out my races well
3991399 i dont feel pressure i feel like i should be here no one can count me out anymore
3991400 i have so many supporters here that make me so motivated and theyve given me a lot of mental support
3991401 some may not be familiar with the requirements of tennis
3991402 sometimes they may cheer too early which will interfere with the players i hope that next time maybe they can pay attention to that
3991403 they go ooh theyre quite sad you didnt make the ball over the net
3991404 sometimes they get quite excited during the point which is quite distracting for us
3991405 but its very difficult to explain to them in chinese during the point we are really fighting hard to play each ball and you hear such loud applause you kind of get confused
3991406 i noticed that in the long rallies they were living and dying with each point i thought it was kind of funny
3991407 it actually makes me get excited theyre so into the point its actually kind of cool i like it
3991408 they get excited for different reasons here in china it seems
3991409 sometimes before the point is over sometimes on a double fault theyre like oh no how bad for the other guy or something like that
3991410 so its actually quite a unique experience its a different cultural experience in a way

3991414 telstra has had a quite dramatic turnaround in fortune since 2005 with significant investments in their ip and mobile networks
3991415 its going to need all of this revenue growth and all of the projected cost savings in order to hit its profitability targets
3991416 in order to reach those margins it also needs to maintain the revenue rates its seen and improve the wholesale situation and take a lot of cost out of its base
3991417 all the transformation benefits really need to start showing up in their account in 2009 or else theres going to be a lot of scepticism around whether or not they can reach this target
3991418 the fibre to the node will push up ebitda margins perhaps a percent or so but it certainly wont be enough to deliver the numbers telstra says it will achieve
3991419 and keep in mind as well that the build wouldnt really start until 2009 and wouldnt be seriously underway until financial year 2010 so its not going to help them that much by 2010

3991428 it could be that telstra hasnt found a buyer for it at the right price so has decided to hold onto kaz for now its hard to tell from this what telstra really wants from kaz theres no committed strategy other than milking it

3991437 they like to do that but its part of the game
3991438 nothing we can do about it weve got pitchers who can throw to hitters too

3991485 i find it a little bit ridiculous that were playing maybe 11 matches in seven days to be honest
3991486 you know i know it rained the first day but quite honestly i dont understand why we dont play such a big tournament over 10 days maybe thats the only regret i have at the moment because i think this is asking just a little bit too much and too much trouble
3991487 theyve made it very hard on us players and i wish there were extra days for us to play
3991488 everybody feels sympathy for me but you dont leave me alone

3991491 it is too early to predict whether lagori will be a success or not i did have a random idea of releasing my film along with suris new one just like before but i dont think the same day release was the reason for our films success as a director i have to be confident of my film and hope that it does well in the box office and impresses the audience
3991492 i dont hesitate to take up projects early and finish them quickly as far as my next film is concerned i have plans of releasing it sometime in january next year however if at that time the situation is different and i want to release it with yogis film then definitely no one can stop me thats how i am

3991496 we were pleased with achievements in the first phase of our support to the agricultural sector this grant comes to enhance and consolidate capacity and ensure continuity of what was achieved
3991497 if we record good growth in agriculture and keep our good growth figures in services and industry then our economy will certainly grow within the range that we set
3991498 there is just no institution in china like ours serving the lower sector
3991499 although the laws on secured transactions are not well defined in cambodia and recovery is not guaranteed this might call into question the banks ability to enforce claims and magnify its exposure to structural weakness in the economy

3991501 my business has plummeted because of all these blocked roads
3991502 the situation is very bad the whole city centre is clogged and full of checkpoints
3991503 after the police blocked the roads we lost all of our business
3991504 weve complained many times to the government and asked them to allow potential customers through
3991505 but they dont care the government doesnt care about this nation
3991506 if terrorists bomb everywhere in the city does that mean the government will close all of the roads so that we cant go anywhere
3991507 the government is only blocking roads to protect themselves not the people
3991508 i feel that i could die at any moment if im at the wrong place at the wrong time
3991509 kabul is becoming a garrison city as it prepares for each attack
3991510 there were far more suicide attacks in kabul in 2007 than in 2008 this year the number has fallen dramatically and the police presence might be a factor in this
3991511 the majority of the violence is occurring in specific districts of the country
3991512 when afghans read about violent incidents elsewhere they tend to feel insecure about their own situation even if they are not in danger
3991513 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3991514 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3991515 a magnificent tribute to the athletes and the olympic spirit
3991516 it would have been prohibitive to have tried to film it live we could not put the helicopter pilot at risk by making him try to follow the firework route

3991520 our total keeps going up and up i would like to sincerely thank everyone for their amazing generosity
3991521 please keep donating and fundraising if we could raise 1million before christmas that would be absolutely amazing
3991522 my cats are my babies they are part of my family she has a really pretty little face and i cannot believe anyone would ever do this
3991523 the pellet had gone through the ribcage and though an operation was able to take a piece of bone out they couldnt remove the pellet the vets just said it would be better to leave it i have to admit that i did fear the worst but i am just so grateful she is still alive
3991524 she went out friday night but she never ventures far from the back garden she is always in calling distance so she can quickly come back in
3991525 but this time she had to drag herself in and you could tell there was something wrong with her leg which she then folded inwards as if she was in a lot of pain
3991526 we thought she might have been in a fight but she is a real coward she would normally run a mile if another cat came towards her she started making some awful noises and there was lot of dry blood i was hysterical when i found out she had been shot
3991527 you kind of feel forgotten people back home are getting on with their lives and doing normal things and you cant really talk about whats been going on anyway so you feel a bit neglected i find that quite hard
3991528 people are quite na ve they pretend its not happening they should read more into the media and discover what is going on out here because it does concern everybody
3991529 somewhere along the line they will know somebody out here so i think people should take more of an interest and appreciate what is going on
3991530 they were the first losses for the battalion as well out here and as you can imagine the atmosphere in the fob was incredibly sombre and upset
3991531 but what was amazing though was how quickly people dealt with it either as individuals or groups
3991532 it is amazing how just allowing people to talk amongst themselves really helps them
3991533 the amount of welfare parcels that we have been sent from people that we have never heard of nor have any connection with the armed forces is touching like when we get a parcel with a small note from a small church somewhere saying we just wanted to say how much we are supporting you
3991534 the guys are doing an amazing job in incredibly challenging conditions and they do it really well suffolk homes
3991535 we have noticed living so close people have twigged there is not one there and scuttling through at a rapid rate of knots above what the speed limit is
3991536 it is disappointing to hear they are not thinking of replacing it until next year
3991537 so much damage was caused to it we were not able to replace the gatso yellow box in its current form
3991538 we are also looking to replace all the gatsos with digital technology instead of the wet film used at the minute
3991539 we do plan to replace it we still undertake mobile enforcement at that spot we do the a140 as a route because of the number of crashes
3991540 we want to bring the wall back because of the fascinating history connected to the pub
3991541 we also want to bring it back 10 years after the last time we had the wall in boxford for the villagers tornado was always looking to make his act different and was a great suffolk eccentric
3991542 for us boxford is a place of pilgrimage with special significance
3991543 we have many connections to tornado my son rides the indian scout bike he used and i have toured with tornados wall so it will be lovely to take it home
3991544 for anybody who is interested in the wall of death boxford is fascinating because it was where one of the early pioneers and innovators grew up and performed in
3991545 you cant put a lot of sand on a beach and expect it to stay in the same position it will shift naturally
3991546 we can only flatten it out in a slope we cant create the curve which is normal for beaches and the sea is doing that what is happening is exactly what we expected the sand is not being washed away

3991554 we scaled down the number of units for more green space and a pond instead of squeezing in as much as we could

3991558 i was trying to concentrate on shooting i wasnt thinking about making history i mean i was two points behind at one stage i was just trying to concentrate i just wanted to shoot well i just wanted to shoot aggressively and thats what i did
3991559 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3991560 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3991561 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
3991562 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
3991563 i should imagine that we should have some sort of indication by early next week what the situation is
3991564 the crews elected to be involved in some passive work rather than be stood down
3991565 the audience will understand that its in the national interest

3991568 has not been able to devote the resources needed to maintain the comets tradition of success
3991569 its a sparsely populated area so it does not affect many people
3991570 the properties are cattle properties so the wind farm wont change the use of the land and the landowners will get some money
3991571 we had overwhelming support for the project from the community and the local council with really no objections
3991572 the wind farm will cover between six and 10 properties
3991573 i dont think it would be too much of a leap to say that you have the same sorts of problems with violence in pregnancy in australia
3991574 three quarters of the women who experienced violence during the pregnancy had also experienced violence from the partner prior to the pregnancy as well
3991575 it could be that if you are in a violent situation you are less likely to be sure that you want to have a baby
3991576 asian women report rates of abortion that are about three times the rate for pakeha people of european descent that is a consistent finding it confirms other studies

3991579 agriculture and the dairy industry at times havent been employers of choice people have been looking elsewhere and also weve seen people moving out of country areas moving towards the city
3991580 our peaceful action highlighted the rudd and bligh governments plans to rapidly expand coal exports when the world is trying to cut global emissions
3991581 the government has failed to control the situation causing the people to panic
3991582 my first instinct was to put my hand out because the adrenalin is going like crazy
3991583 the second i caught the ball i was jumping around
3991584 i would really love to get david ortiz to sign the ball
3991585 this ruling is about closure and the city and the fire department moving forward together to continue to provide the highest possible levels of public safety for our citizens
3991586 i believe by showing my willingness to move on and live with the arbitrators decision is an important step and i want to call upon everyone in this city to move on and to realize that this issue has been resolved
3991587 in a rebuke of city policy the arbitration panel unanimously agreed that there must be a modification to the citys practice of requiring all firefighters to visit the city physician
3991588 the arbitration panel inserted language to include that the fire chief will have the discretion to challenge a sick leave but must have legitimate reason to challenge it not the citys current interpretation
3991589 theyve been mistreated for such a long period of time
3991590 the city now has 30 days to docket the necessary funds to cover the jlmc award with the board of aldermen we will withhold commenting until we have a chance to the thoroughly review the ruling
3991591 if the mayor really waited 30 days it could be after the sept 2 board meeting til this issue is settled
3991592 we need a new tone with this decision its time to get over the bitterness and begin the healing process
3991593 mayor cohen wants to be certain that every current and retired firefighter receives the money to which they are entitled and until we are clear about how much we need to allocate he believes it would be unwise to docket the financing before the board
3991594 however firefighters can be certain that they will receive the retroactive pay and other benefits that this arbitration ruling calls for
3991595 weve got some wonderfully generous donors who are really committed to this project

3991697 its difficult to imagine a circumstance where the government could directly control interest rates without a whole range of adverse consequences occurring a whole range of other things
3991698 weve seen it in the past for example where we had a cap on interest rates
3991699 what that meant was that people ended up with cocktail loans for their homes where they borrowed a proportion of their mortgage at the official interest rate and had to borrow the rest at a really high interest rate much much higher than the official rate
3991700 now i wouldnt speculate about what they might be and of course its not my direct responsibility
3991701 well cross that bridge if and when we come to it if we believe that the banks are not doing the right thing then clearly we will be examining the options to put greater pressure on
3991702 but the banks will carry a very heavy onus to explain any variation from any reduction by the reserve bank in the rates as compared with what they actually do

3991714 i was having a weekend get together with some friends once a year and i wanted to make it something really cool and special
3991715 eventually it got to the point where i started building whole fake rooms inside of a hotel suite just to increase the fun for my friends
3991716 he said youve got to check out what this guys done it was amazing
3991717 its such a rush when you play im just pumped up for hours afterwards
3991718 we wanted to make it as visceral and real as we could while still keeping it safe
3991719 we try to make everything a real world challenge instead of rolling dice for combat
3991720 there was lots of role playing involved and i played it to the hilt i got to be vicious and bitchy but also have fun with it

3991729 the push for back to school shopping is so relentless in our society
3991730 we decided this would be the perfect time to do a swap
3991731 we are hoping to alleviate the pressure on families to spend money they might not have and to buy things they dont need or want
3991732 there is definitely pressure applied to consume to over extend and it is our hope that we can help people realize that its way more fun and creative to share what is already out there and for each person to define their own style thereby making the idea of hand me downs and clothes swapping cool in the eyes of the kids and green in the eyes of our planet
3991733 i think austin has a lot of creative and environmentally minded people people who are now having children of their own

3991855 they repelled wave after wave of assaulting suicidal attacks and not one of the enemy got inside our position thanks to them

3991859 the rupee is weaker mainly because of higher oil prices while lower stocks are also hurting sentiment
3991860 however there are some state run banks selling dollars at around 42 87 88 levels so rupee should stay in a band of 42 75 42 88 at least in initial trade
3991861 i think the lower price has attracted buyers into the market given the extreme volatility of the gold price in recent days i think picking the near term direction is very difficult
3991862 i think gold has been principally driven by investor activity and the u s dollar movement has been an important influence on gold
3991863 definitely theres a bit of bargain hunting but i dont think we are out of golds decline yet resistance should be around 836 and then 845 the downside of course will still be around the 800s

3991949 en el primer tiempo jugamos bien y logramos sacar una ventaja en el marcador pero aunque luchamos los cuarenta minutos no pudimos llevarnos la victoria ante un gran rival
3991950 antes de pensar en ese choque primero tenemos que recuperar a algunos jugadores con molestias f sicas como ricky rubio juan carlos navarro y carlos jim nez que no pudo ser tenido en cuenta por una dolencia en la espalda

3991976 inspired a wave of political enthusiasm like nothing seen in this country for decades
3991977 t here have been troubling signs that you are moving away from the core commitments shared by many who have supported your campaign toward a more cautious and centrist stance
3991978 if you win in november we will work to support your stands when we agree with you and to challenge them when we dont we look forward to an ongoing and constructive dialogue with you when you are elected president
3991979 look let me talk about the broader issue this whole notion that i am shifting to the center
3991980 the people who say this apparently havent been listening to me i believe in a whole lot of things that make me progressive and put me squarely in the democratic camp i believe in personal responsibility i also believe in faith thats not something new ive been talking about that for years so the notion that this is me trying to look centrist is not true
3991981 t he speech is actually directed at what obama calls my friends on the left i cant remember a presidential nominee specifically courting left wing voters and activists before honestly i really cant this is a sign of increased respect and being taken more seriously
3991982 we intend to join and engage with our brothers and sisters in the vast rainbow of social movements to come together in support of obamas unprecedented campaign and candidacy even though it is candidate centered there is no doubt that the campaign is a social movement one greater than the candidate himself ever imagined
3991983 formation of a progressive force within his coalition anything less could allow his eventual drift towards the right as the general election approaches it was the industrial strikes and radical organizers in the 1930s who pushed roosevelt to support the new deal and it will be the obama movement that makes it necessary and possible to end the war in iraq renew our economy with a populist emphasis and confront the challenge of global warming
3991984 to allow obama to pass for what he is not a progressive
3991985 seek green support against the claim of some that there are no real differences between obama and mccain
3991986 unions are the single most powerful threat to neoliberalisms exercise of unchecked power which explains the constant barrage of anti union propaganda in the media often emanating from reports issued by seemingly objective watchdog organizations or commissions
3991987 membership growth parallels activism when the membership is involved in industrial or political campaigns recruitment is strongest
3991988 we must not think we will be able to do this alone we have to build a massive coalition with the whole civil society including the labor movement in order to challenge the privatization of key public services just like we did in south africa the onslaught of privatization of public services formed by the neoliberal agenda needs a collective response

3991993 the origins of the conflagration in june in kashmir on forest land allocation for construction of facilities for the amarnath yatra lie in open state promotion of the pilgrimage the yatra has caused considerable damage to the economy and ecology of the area the high handed actions of the shri amarnath shrine board only aggravated the situation
3991994 the sasb runs a virtually parallel administration and acts as a sovereign body promoting hindu interests increasing the number of pilgrims from 12 000 in 1989 to over 400 000 in 2007 and extending the period of the pilgrimage from 15 days to two and half months
3991995 such a conflagration undermines the unity and integrity of india
3991996 the unforgettable tour gave me an opportunity to perform with amitabh bachchan aishwarya rai and abhishek on the same stage
3991997 los angeles and san francisco shows have been overwhelming and i am looking forward to visiting other cities and reaching out to my fans i have worked with aishwarya and preity before and that has been great also there is a great comfort level in our team and this has been an unforgettable experience

3992001 my film has grossed rs 46 48 crore rupees over the first weekend thats more than om shanti om and welcome which had the highest openings so far so obviously the film has been liked i cant please every single sikh who are these agitators this is nothing but a shortcut to fame the boys of the sikh youth federation mustve thought that when the delhi gurudwara parbandhak committee protested akshay rushed to delhi in amritsar they mustve thought this is their way of getting akshay into amritsar surely therere easier ways of getting stars attention and akshay couldnt spend one year moving from city to city appeasing the imagined hurt of self appointed champions of the sikh community these are people who dont respect the opinion the highest authorities of their community whove said theres nothing objectionable in singh is kinng all the important and powerful bodies of the sikh community cleared the film what were these boys on friday protesting about they said they hadnt even seen the film they just said it was an insult to sikhism but in what way
3992002 they feel somehow their culture will be threatened when on the contrary culture specific films like jodhaa akbar and singh is kinng pay a homage to the people and culture of a community
3992003 the labour market should be completely opened up and by 457 programs right across the board or certainly if not right across the board down to areas that i would call semi skilled such as truck drivers
3992004 let me say today that all the work that council has done to date indicate that the straight through option has firstly the lowest impacts in fact almost minimal impacts on the local community
3992005 secondly it also has the highest benefit to cost ratio and thirdly it has the best business case
3992006 i am not particularly happy with the ramps for that connected option
3992007 as a state were not aware of the full details yet as a matter of fact i think the council is still forming its own views in that and when they have a proposal to put before us well give it due consideration
3992008 but i can assure you well work very closely with the brisbane city council to get good outcomes for the motoring public of brisbane
3992009 the hale street outcome is one thats been worked through

3992011 reuters is deeply disturbed by a conclusion that would severely curtail the freedom of the media to cover the conflict by effectively giving soldiers a free hand to kill without being sure that they were not firing on journalists
3992012 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analyzed clearly
3992013 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3992014 these findings mean that a journalist with a camera is at risk of coming under fire and theres not that much that can be done
3992015 thats unacceptable its difficult to believe that the idf took the necessary precautions to avoid causing harm to civilians as it is obliged to do under international law
3992016 i see it as a family show it just happens to be a very fractured f cked up family and it just seemed very germane to hank as a character
3992017 from the beginnings its always been about a guy who came out to la almost as a sense of fulfilling some kind of manifest destiny he wanted to come out here and seek his fortune it could not be set in any other state as well
3992018 i think his only problem is hes committed to telling the truth at all costs and thats what hes ultimately gotten into his way its a very noble thing but i think it gets exhausting for the people around him i think thats maybe contributed to his crisis
3992019 actually i had first heard of it as it was oregon actually apparently in the 70s there were bumper stickers that said dont californicate oregon because californians were coming up there and i just thought it was a great great title for this show
3992020 i always saw hank as a guy who is probably not updating his record collection a whole lot so the music that we used in the pilot was reflective of what was going through his head on a daily basis so yeah it was very much important to us to get those songs and i would love to repeat that as much as humanly possible given the showtime budget theyve actually been very kind in paying for that stuff for us
3992021 wedding bells are breaking up that old gang of mine

3992023 you can almost hear her mind whirring shes amazed at how easy it was to snatch denver away from the obama saps like taking candy from a baby except beanpole guy doesnt eat candy in just a couple of weeks bill and hill were able to drag no drama obama into a swamp of cinton drama
3992024 now theyve made barrys convention all about them their dissatisfaction and revisionism and barely disguised desire to see him fail whatever insincere words of support the clintons muster their primal scream gets louder he cant win he cant close the deal we told you so
3992025 prison medical care receiver j clark kelso filed a motion today to order the state to give him 8 billion to fully fund his long term care plan for 10 500 inmates
3992026 kelso asked for 6 billion to construct new prison health care facilities and now wants an additional 2 billion to complete the improvements to existing facilities this court order if granted would add 3 1 billion to the states budget deficit during the current fiscal year
3992027 in a study published in the july 2008 issue of geophysical research letters drs david s nolan and eric d rappin from the university of miamis rosenstiel school of marine and atmospheric science describe a new method for evaluating the frequency of hurricane formation in present and future tropical climates
3992028 while current thinking about changes in hurricane frequency comes mostly from computer simulations of global climate the computer models used for these studies can only represent the coarsest features of hurricanes thus casting doubt in their predictions of hurricane activity
3992029 the new approach by nolan and rappin developed in collaboration with dr
3992030 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear
3992031 instead we got exactly the opposite result emphasis ours as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater
3992032 the whispered allegations about john edwards were an open secret that was debated in every newsroom and reported by almost none
3992033 now they want to tax me for driving back in i dont like the idea of government sticking their hands in our pockets every time they need a solution to a problem caused by poor planning
3992034 ccw licenses will be issued to persons of good and upstanding character who possess credible significant and substantiated cause to fear for their safety ccw licenses will not be issued for political social or other reasons
3992035 many people were ecstatic during the early primaries as each states voters heard his glittering generalities for the first time
3992036 the media loved the novelty of a black candidate with a real chance to become president and his left wing vision of the world was largely their vision as well
3992037 there was outrage in the mainstream media when abc anchor man charles gibson asked obama a serious question about the economic effects of a capital gains tax
3992038 the fact that senator obama did not have a very coherent answer made things worse for charles gibson since obama can do no wrong in the eyes of many of his supporters they resented gibsons having asked him such a question
3992039 the question incidentally was why senator obama was advocating a higher capital gains tax rate when experience had shown that the government typically collected more revenue from a lower capital gains tax rate than from a higher rate
3992040 senator obama acted as if he had never thought about it that way

3992047 i really didnt expect it im really excited people always used to call me either cute or pretty but no one ever called me sexy i take it as a compliment
3992048 there is nothing wrong in being called sexy i think the term itself has been misunderstood people think that a person is sexy only if she is wearing tiny clothes but for me being sexy is about being mysterious and having your own personality and certainly has nothing to do with a persons fashion sense
3992049 stardom has not changed me i believe i am the same person i am too new in the industry i like being in front of the camera and i love acting

3992051 gayatri is an independent girl who knows what she wants she is focussed she is modern as well as traditional in her thoughts the role is very similar to the person i am
3992052 right now we are focussing on our careers and what we are doing in front of the camera at the end of the day we are both actors one plays a certain character in a film and so we cannot let possessiveness come in between we have to understand each other
3992053 i want to focus on commercial cinema as of now but if i find any offbeat film or a small production house with a good role i would love to go for it

3992057 looking at the network traffic overall where malware is being hosted i think its almost certainly a cause and effect

3992132 thats the key were going to find something that works and we are working on that
3992133 what ive seen so far is the commissioner taking the position that because north forest has a previous history because youve fought us on some issues you should be removed
3992134 that doesnt meet the smell test i dont think under the voting rights act
3992135 the board has a right to representation according to the law
3992136 i dont understand i cant get inside the head of tea
3992137 my history tells me though that tea when it comes to students of color boards of color is not well thought of
3992138 we should all sit down as grown ups and do whats best for the students
3992139 the bottom line is they have no money and it breaks your heart when you travel up the road and see what deer park and crosby and humble and even hisd have these students are getting inferior educations
3992140 i am sad that were again not going to have our reports out before the start of the school year
3992141 theyre not getting a year off its just a bit late
3992142 how do you explain that to a 10 year old
3992143 because the test scores will arrive in the fall crucial decisions had to be made without this one piece of information
3992144 weve probably done the standard setting exercise more quickly than we ever have in the past because were trying to get those designations out as quickly as we can
3992145 im surprised we pushed the calendar as quickly as we have
3992146 the physical evidence the bus the tire tell a story
3992147 its going to tell us what happened in the crash
3992148 we need the prayers from everybody to help all the families who went through this tragedy to have the strength to pull through
3992149 you can tell the jury that this never happened cant you
3992150 im going to let the jury decide what would be fair
3992151 she said i hit her and pushed her against a wall
3992152 i was not going to apologize for something that i didnt do wrong
3992153 working in a bookstore was like a candy shop for her
3992154 at least three times a year id get a book with a note saying she thought id find it interesting she did that with everybody
3992155 shed get them set up with doctors shed work with other charitable groups to obtain food lodging and counseling

3992171 everybody feels sympathy for me but you dont leave me alone cant you understand that im under stress
3992172 categorical opinion that if the child is born it would suffer from serious handicaps
3992173 we are prima facie of the view that the plea of loss of confi
3992174 i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can if i can do that ill be fine
3992175 the most important thing is being able to separate the two events and just move on ive trained for it im used to it the biggest part for me in the psychological part
3992176 what a great way to finish with a gold medal and a world record
3992177 for us to break the record by so far is amazing i really look back to sitting back and cheering for the aussies
3992178 i did my best and ran out of room at the end
3992179 it definitely gives me more motivation im a little bit tired and i have a full day to recover
3992180 i cant believe it after the relay i could have sunk but i told myself that after all these years of hard work i cant let myself go down my legs were shaking at the start i was really tense just like the other seven guys
3992181 its a new generation and its now time to step aside they did a great job im from the previous generation
3992182 i was so calm that i think i could have seen each face in this venue
3992183 so to go out there and accomplish a medal is really exciting it doesnt top the relay medal but its something ive been pushing for for years
3992184 theres no way i can choose among them i shared a great relationship with all of them and we had a great time during the shoot
3992185 i was a little apprehensive at the thought of performing dads number but i eventually did it and the result is for you to judge
3992186 we have all had our share of relationships we have been through the first crush mere attractions and mature love this film is a romantic comedy which looks at these relationships through my eyes and what they teach me about love and life
3992187 i couldnt even name my grandfathers film in the same sentence as bah that was a classic it was autobiographical this ones just a romantic comedy there can be no comparison
3992188 yes when we started there was a fourth chapter in rajs life but it had to be eventually dropped because we were exceeding the length we wanted to keep the movie to
3992189 its not because saawariya didnt do well my performance was liked and i dont want to let that go in saawariya sanjay handheld me through the entire film but i have grown up with sid bah director siddharth anand i have given a lot to this film in terms of look feel and creative inputs unlike my first where i was following sanjay all through the experience is richer now
3992190 no i may be worried because its my film but never on the account of yash raj they have always made great movies they are passionate about filmmaking have been the top notch filmmakers and will always remain so its me who needs to prove things here
3992191 its hard to think of a dressing room without bhaichung
3992192 our expectation is that any action will be consistent with the rule of law and the pakistani constitution
3992193 it is a tough job as i have to mug up all the lengthy dialogues and need to have the correct diction and pronounciation
3992194 driving up and down very steep grades with giant trucks and high speed locals hindering you left and right
3992195 no services on this road for the next 106 miles
3992196 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3992197 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3992198 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3992199 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3992200 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3992201 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3992202 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3992203 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3992204 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3992205 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3992206 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3992207 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3992208 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3992209 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3992210 much has been made about the poor air quality in china and the effect it is having on our athletes
3992211 but we have a serious home grown pollution problem right here and canadians ranging from the very young to the very old are paying the price
3992212 both of which rise during pollution episodes and in the few days afterwards and explain in significant part the number of acute deaths due to air pollution
3992213 canada gets a fair bit of pollution from the american midwest which drifts north comes across through ontario and continues right on through to quebec
3992214 sometimes people in rural areas think theyre escaping very nicely because they dont live in downtown wherever the fact is these masses of air pollution move across the countryside and some of our worst air pollution occurs in rural areas because it just happens to be downwind
3992215 this report shows for the first time the tragic effects of the toxic air that we breathe whether it is in my hometown of vancouver or across the country in st johns
3992216 honestly i was just taking it one elimination at a time
3992217 if someone would have said id be here id have said no way
3992218 i think you have to be pretty grounded in the idea that i have my friends and family at home and they know who i am
3992219 i just want to say a huge thanks to medicine hat and area and everyone who supported me and voted me
3992220 before the show i had an idea of the kind of music i wanted to make and that hasnt changed
3992221 but in terms of performance and confidence and learning little tricks to use on stage those are not things you can pay for
3992222 there were times i didnt notice the nerves until i was done singing then id be holding the mike and notice im shaking i must have been nervous
3992223 i dont think i would have expected to make such good friends
3992224 there have been low key talks in the last day or two

3992230 i need a little bit of competition to get going make it meaningful instead of just a normal round
3992231 ill kind of just bear down and focus a little more you just grind it out a little bit harder if things arent quite going your way
3992232 its always fun to play with all the guys and everybody always gets ready for it
3992233 he left the world not having an enemy he never bothered anybody and a lot of people still talk about him
3992234 he knew everybody and liked everybody it was hard to get rid of him sometimes and hed show up in some unusual places i was at a tournament across the line the u s border and dooley showed up the sports world in prince george hasnt been the same since he left
3992235 it was time to do something for him and give him an honour he should have had when he was here
3992236 for us to do this tournament as a way to remember him i think hell be looking down and thanking everybody
3992237 its a big step ive never done anything like that before the furthest ive ever gone was smithers but its something ive been working towards
3992238 going down to vancouver is a big step because ill be going against kids that get to practice all year round they have more of a chance because it gets cold here i just hope i do my best usually i try not to look at my placing just my scores thats all that really matters if i get a good score
3992239 i was really pleased with my horse at the prince george show
3992240 when i got her she was showing at the fourth level but im not ready for that yet
3992241 next year my coach and i will try to get up to second level and maybe third level by the end of the year

3992248 masyarakat diharap tenang dan tidak terpengaruh oleh pesan singkat itu itu sengaja dibuat untuk membuat masyarakat resah
3992249 kalo ada telepon yang nomornya berwarna merah jangan diangkat karena bisa menelan jiwa hari ini sudah disiarkan di berita terjadi di jakarta dan duri dan sudah terbukti sekarang masih diusut oleh pihak kepolisian dugaan sementara adalah kasus pembunuhan jarak jauh melalui telepon genggam hp oleh dukun ilmu hitam si penelepon adalah roh gentayangan yang mencari mangsa harap dimengerti dan kirim ke teman atau saudara semua harap saling membantu sesama umat manusia
3992250 informasi kalau ada nomor hp yang 0866 atau 0666 masuk berwarna merah mohon jangan diangkat karena ada virus kematian soalnya di jakarta dan di sumatera sudah ada yang meninggal gara gara masalah ini orang bilang lagi uji ilmu hitam
3992251 tolong diperhatikan serius jika menerima telp masuk dari hp dengan kepala no 0866 atau 066 dengan warna tulisannya merah mohon dengan sangat jangan diterima sama sekali jangan memencet tombol apa pun karena telah memakan korban 1 orang di medan dan 3 orang di pekanbaru yang hangus karena hp nya meledak mohon beritahu teman teman lain
3992252 saya bisa pastikan dari sisi teknologi hal itu tidak mungkin apalagi sampai ada keterangan bahwa nomor yang muncul ada 666 dan berwarna merah itu tidak mungkin bisa membuat nyawa seseorang melayang
3992253 saya bukan ahli santet tapi kalau ponsel jadi perantara santet itu mungkin saja itu kan sama halnya dengan santet lewat perantaraan batu pisau sendok garpu atau benda lainnya
3992254 selama ini testimoni yang muncul baik di riau jambi atau kota lain cuma katanya katanya saja sampai saat ini tidak ada bukti konkret
3992255 soal radiasi itu memang sudah ada sejak ponsel diciptakan tapi kan sudah ada badan yang mengawasi soal itu kalau di tingkat dunia ada federal communication comission fcc yang mengawasi mereka punya standar sehingga orang tidak celaka karena hal itu
3992256 saya berani menjadi orang pertama yang menyelidiki ini kalau memang betul ada korban karena santet lewat ponsel kecuali ada orang yang disantet ketika sedang terima panggilan lewat ponsel ini hal lain kalau memang seperti itu bukan salah ponselnya memang kebetulan saja si korban misalnya kena santet saat pegang ponsel
3992257 saya menengarai penonaktifan ponsel itu berpotensi pada tindakan kriminal karena akan membuat pemilik ponsel sulit dihubungi dan ujung ujungnya menjadi korban penipuan misalnya dengan modus transfer uang dalam jumlah tertentu
3992258 ini bagian dari permainan orang orang tertentu tujuannya agar masyarakat resah dan kacau lalu mencari bantuan kepada sekelompok orang yang akhirnya dipercaya menjadi pemimpin
3992259 masyarakat yang menerima teror sms itu jangan percaya serahkan semuanya kepada allah
3992260 dalam alquran dijelaskan santet adalah sihir dengan mengirimkan setan melalui angin sms itu dikirimkan melalui sinyal ini sebenarnya bagian dari angin jadi bisa saja setan dikirimkan melalui sms
3992261 orang yang dalam keadaan pikiran kosong atau mengambang akan mudah dimasuki sihir
3992262 agar orang selalu sadar dan ingat kepada tuhan maka perbanyaklah zikir dan membaca ayat alquran
3992263 semakin lama kita membiarkan pikiran kita kosong maka akan semakin mudah dimasuki setan
3992264 kebanyakan dukun akan menggunakan jin atau setan juga untuk mengusir jin atau setan yang merasuki seseorang

3992267 the west is not a place its a state of mind
3992268 colorado will miss him dearly but thanks watch this denver post video of jack weil shortly after his 106th birthday in 2007 watch this jack weil video produced by the denver metro convention amp visitors bureau view a gallery of photos of jack weils life to his family and rockmounts unique western fashions his legacy will live on for at least another 107 years
3992269 through his influence for over 100 years we learned the importance of hard work and balancing careers with humor and compassion
3992270 he was proud of his family proud of his community and proud of the longevity of his business
3992271 he represented western values he always greeted you by standing up giving a firm handshake and looking you in the eye and thats part of western culture and a big part of who jack was
3992272 hes someone who is part of defining what denver is all about
3992273 all of his values are the values we talked about for the democratic national convention

3992279 the memory the drives the processors and the heatsinks are the things that take up the space in a server
3992280 we stripped off the things customers tell us they dont value we stripped off the hot pluggable storage we stripped off the storage redundancy we reduced the memory footprint and we have a smaller number of dimm sockets when a customer looks at the 220c they may think its underspecified but on the connectivity side weve enhanced things we can add infiniband or high speed ethernet its a balance if i already boot from network attached storage if im running an app where four dimms are sufficient if i can compromise on local storage and the memory footprint then i get the processor density
3992281 you have to balance the amount of processing per square foot and the power requirements you can either drive towards ultimate density or the ultimate in efficiency but with the 220c you get three times the density of a 1u rack
3992282 we use the same power supplies the same fans and the same chassis but we double up the density and hopefully get 60 better performance per watt
3992283 there are only so many things you can flex in the x86 architecture
3992284 you can flex the i o the processing the number of sockets and cores the memory these are the core technologies were flexing the same number of things but the way we deliver the balance is slightly different to the way ibm delivers idataplex
3992285 intel has had a performance advantage since may last year so the majority demand is for intel processors
3992286 if barcelona delivers and i think it probably will i expect customer demand to split between the two again
3992287 there will be small business customers who look at this and say were already using a small storage network and these are ideal to use as file and print servers web servers and application servers
3992288 specifically hp claims a 60 performance per watt advantage over a cluster of dell poweredge 1955 servers
3992289 my feeling is that blades are usually a generation of technology behind as well

3992302 what is he like as a family man how he is able to capture the audience and what is the rock star persona that he has been able to create
3992303 this young audience all of which had grown up essentially with one president all of a sudden was paying attention to politics and to the world in a way that i thought was galvanizing
3992304 youd have to be quite a writer to do justice to this mans story and if you read
3992305 i think we will end up being just fine roll call or no roll call

3992480 im going to pitch to my strengths 99 percent of the time and especially in that situation
3992481 im not going to get beat with my third best pitch
3992482 putting a guy on base to face a guy tied for the lead in home runs thats a classic confrontation there
3992483 i hit the 3 2 pitch good but i beat it in the dirt
3992484 i dont get many hits when i hit it on the ground
3992485 adam hit the ball right on the screws but they were playing him up the middle
3992486 we had our opportunity the big out was the strikeout of chris young
3992487 i know in the past theyve tried to beat me with fastballs up and in
3992488 i started off really good again but the things ive been working on mechanically i got away from in the fifth sixth inning
3992489 no one really did anything wrong i just wish i could have gotten that pitch to vernon down a little more
3992490 this is dangerous because were doing just enough to lose right now
3992491 thats not good we have to start doing the things that it takes to win
3992492 i didnt throw enough strikes early but i started to relax about the fourth inning thats when i started making the pitches i wanted
3992493 you get a walk an aggravating bunt and then a double play grounder that takes a bad hop
3992494 kenny did very well tonight but weve been getting bad hops lately
3992495 he just has to work on getting first pitch strikes and getting ahead of hitters
3992496 i didnt want to go out there and see a bone sticking out of his leg
3992497 hell be reassessed in a couple days but if he cant pitch it will be a big loss for the team
3992498 it was definitely wild but well take it giants pitcher barry zito was doing really well unfortunately for him at the end things went bad and we just kind of got in the way of some balls
3992499 ive never seen anything like it but ill take it
3992500 thats the sign of a good team taking advantage of your opportunities
3992501 then we cant hit two batters with the bases loaded
3992502 im most upset with the walk to loretta and hitting quintero
3992503 those were the difference makers its my job to come back and attack loretta you cant do anything about bloop hits and sacrifice flies its on me for walking loretta thats the difference maker

3992562 consumers were happy to embrace standard dvd when that format arrived because the improvement in quality over vhs videotapes was dramatic standard dvd didnt require the purchase of a new tv either in contrast while half of the respondents to our survey rated quality as much better than standard dvd another 40 termed it only somewhat better and most are very satisfied with the performance of their current dvd players

3992567 the continued strong growth of the home theater market necessitates that we cater to the needs of each particular segment
3992568 uei is the partner with the broadest portfolio of control technology and the deepest experience in building around the customer experience their remote control units are the perfect complement to our entire lineup of a v products
3992569 onkyo is known for having an unsurpassed love of sound and for being perfectionists in the pursuit of providing the best components possible
3992570 we approached this relationship as one that warranted time and effort in the design of completely new remote devices that seamlessly blended with their attractive existing products our new partnership will further extend ueis reach into the mainstream high end and custom installation market all at once
3992571 sunfire is known for its ability to project big sound from small places and we proudly continue in that tradition with our new cherry hrs satellite speaker system we believe we have achieved the kind of bookshelf speaker that everyone else has been trying to build and when combined with an hrs sub this system is in a class all by itself
3992572 clearly we are not saying the powervault or any rgpc product is green
3992573 however if an rgpc dealer can sell a 25 000 power management device like powervault because the homeowner offsets a percentage of that cost with rebates or tax credits earned by installing a renewable energy system everyone benefits the dealer the homeowner and the planet
3992574 the digital transition in cable broadcasting is poised to accelerate as the mandatory cutover time nears many viewers need a device to keep their analog tvs from going obsolete
3992575 the major cable systems are all looking at dta converters to solve this problem and they need a reliable and highly compatible remote to control the converter delta provides a cost effective and reliable way to address their needs
3992576 stereo 3d is still in its infancy in many ways
3992577 we have been making impressive 3d movies but live transmissions bring their own unique challenges like every live show theres less time to make corrections and no room for error one of the big challenges has also been how to keep the parallel signals in perfect synchronisation thats a special challenge over satellite links where atmospheric conditions can be problematic to do this we have developed a solution where we multiplex the 3d signals into a single 2d signal for transmission at the receiving end we then un wrap the 2d signal back into a 3d picture we have done this before but not over such a long link and internationally we have also developed the twin camera systems that will be capturing the images in this case we will be using two camera rigs to show that 3d pictures can be cut and mixed live
3992578 this is a natural progression from last years live hd interview with robert zemeckis we are working with a group of technology partners who are at the cutting edge of 3d imaging and transmission
3992579 arqiva is delighted to have been asked to provide the communications technology and expertise behind this important and high profile 3d event our interest and experience in the digital cinema market means we are very happy to use our global assets to showcase the exciting opportunities that new technology is bringing to live event organisers and exhibitors
3992580 as the manufacturer of the worlds most widely used digital cinema projectors the cp2000 series christie has always recognized the importance of the ibc d cinema program and supported the event and screenings each year the d cinema sessions look to enliven debate amongst those shaping our industry and the first ever live transatlantic broadcast in stereo 3d is sure to do just that were delighted to be working with 3ality digital arqiva real d and the team at dreamworks to help create another first for ibc
3992581 we manage the separate images with a special adapter that fits on the projector which then transmits the left and right eye images through the glasses to the viewer said real ds president joshua greer
3992582 the vast majority of 3d equipped theatres around the world are using real d because its not only simple to install but easy to operate with our very low cost glasses that users can keep it avoids a lot of staff intensive handling and the picture quality is truly awesome
3992583 but setting the pace is what we do each year at ibc the technology we are using is exciting enough but to have jeffrey katzenberg addressing our delegates in conversation with our good friend elizabeth daley is a real treat and unique privilege this really is the genesis of a new age in immersive cinema and broadcasting it will be a very special night for everyone
3992584 it is an honor to be selected by my peers to help bring to light the importance of acoustics in everyday living
3992585 ncac member firms are working hard to find better ways of communicating solutions that serve society by controlling and managing noise vibration and the acoustical environment
3992586 russ is a very active participant within ncac and the industry as a whole so taking on a leadership role is a great fit for him
3992587 with his extensive knowledge base along with his commitment to education were excited to have him help to further the message of ncac over the next two years
3992588 i am particularly excited about building on the excellent relationship ncac member firms enjoy with higher education and expanding our commitment to supporting meaningful academic programs in acoustics architecture engineering and design
3992589 i think its obvious what our weakness is our weakness is on the mound
3992590 we have a burning desire to win just as bad as anyone youve got to have pitching to do it theres no doubt about it youve got to have pitching to do it
3992591 when you take a young pitching staff and you put it against the boston red sox and they know how to make you work and make you pay when you make a mistake this is what happens
3992592 i thought he had power on his two seamer and his cutter its a shame you looked up at the end and the inherited runners score
3992593 i really thought he pitched really really well we set out to get a win and we did that we made it a little more interesting than we needed to but i thought his stuff was really good we scored early and we added on we talk about it so much when you do that a mistake doesnt beat you
3992594 nothing flashy from youk he just gets the job done every night
3992595 he comes to play every night he comes to play hard
3992596 he comes up with big hits hes a winning player youk sometimes holds that little grudge on his shoulders about not being a five tool player but in his mind he says im going to win games for this club and be one of the best players in baseball
3992597 study from arturo bris a finance professor at imd business school in lausanne switzerland found that even controlling for short selling market efficiency had deteriorated more for the 19 stocks affected by the rule than for other comparable u s financial stocks

3992603 you have a way of making an imprint or changing peoples perspective you dont lose your focus by knowing what you want and why you are heading in a particular direction home and family continue to be high priorities but learning when to say no could be very important you understand others well but do they understand you

3992612 i cannot hear very well please look at me when you speak
3992613 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3992614 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3992615 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3992616 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3992617 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3992618 we think a lot of bad things that happen to the cardiovascular system are because the lining of the vessels cracks and becomes inflamed setting the stage for plaques to form and rupture

3992625 we all possess some intuitive sense we know our convictions from our mere hunches
3992626 this sense of confidence or lack thereof is critical to our success but how it arises in the brain has long been a mystery
3992627 these neurons seem to have been registering after the rat made its decision how uncertain the animal was that it was about to receive its desired reward
3992628 we tested several alternative explanations but the best explanation for the neural activity we observed was that these neurons were signaling the confidence of the animal about its decisions
3992629 although previous work had suggested that confidence estimates might be a complex process restricted to humans and perhaps other primates
3992630 our results to the contrary show that for the brain to estimate confidence in a choice is no more complex than calculating the choice itself
3992631 this new option to abort and restart constitutes a decision that should be made based on the level of confidence about getting a reward
3992632 ultimately confidence about getting a reward is a direct function of the animals confidence about the decision they have just made in this way we sought to measure a variable internal to the animals how confident they were about whether they made the right choice or not by observing how it influenced their behavior
3992633 that confidence estimation is not a complex function specific to humans but a core component of the process of decision making probably found throughout the animal kingdom
3992634 future studies of this kind may illuminate the question of how we form an intuitive sense of the solidity of a belief how we distinguish fact from fiction itself
3992635 my name is becky and since youve interrupted my dinner may i ask what you are doing
3992636 were on a quest to find the most talented lizard in the land
3992637 but weve already run into some trouble in this forest

3992639 there are mutant caterpillars in this marsh be careful what you say they might hear you
3992640 no duh chris youre such an idiot get me out of here
3992641 with this study we looked at a very large population to determine how each individual could be stratified based on his or her dna
3992642 we want to see if the snps tied to a specific ancestry hold any biological significance to populations of different origins we want to see if the snps that we isolated are related to natural selection and adaptation for example to the weather conditions of different regions
3992643 because this method is purely computational and leverages linear algebraic methods such as principal components analysis without the use of information on self reported ancestry we were able to treat the data as a black box
3992644 much of the genetic variation was found to stretch between two points what we speculate is the northern european to southern european ancestry axis
3992645 there is no remedy for love but to love more
3992646 the most eloquent silence that of two mouths meeting in a kiss
3992647 you come to love not by finding the perfect person but by seeing an imperfect person perfectly
3992648 the best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched they must be felt with the heart
3992649 i love you not only for what you are but for what i am when i am with you
3992650 in real love you want the other persons good in romantic love you want the other person
3992651 a kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop words when speech becomes superfluous

3992653 this possibility is accepted then so must the possibility of total market demand being temporarily at least below actual productive capacity general market oversupply leading to idle productive capacity becomes a theoritical possibility
3992654 the ship would be pushed by the spatial bubble and the bubble would be traveling faster than the speed of light
3992655 the dark energy is simultaneously decreased just in front of the ship to decrease and bring to a stop the expansion rate of the universe in front of the ship
3992656 if the dark energy can be made negative directly in front of the ship then space in front of the ship would locally contract
3992657 we are still a very long ways off before we could create something to harness that type of energy
3992658 i just poked her a little bit with a knife

3992661 crowds at olympic tennis have been larger and livelier at night but for most any match they can be unpredictable even something as routine as a first serve into the net might trigger a buzz from the stands
3992662 theyre quite sad you didnt make the ball over the net
3992663 but theyre like oh no how bad for the guy so its actually quite a unique experience its a different cultural experience in a way honestly i enjoy it
3992664 the longer the point went you know the happier they were
3992665 sometimes they get quite excited during the point which is quite distracting for us
3992666 but its very difficult to explain to them in chinese during the point we are really fighting hard to play each ball and you hear such loud applause during it and you kind of get confused
3992667 i just wanted to win my heat i guess its going to be me and ryan in the middle tomorrow its fine its all i wanted to do
3992668 i wanted to set up for a middle lane tomorrow and then tomorrow is going to be the real battle
3992669 i feel fine i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can if i can do that ill be fine
3992670 those races are tiring but this is what i train for i feel a lot better just mentally and physically tomorrow morning will be a good one
3992671 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3992672 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3992673 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3992674 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3992675 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3992676 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3992677 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3992678 one those vegetarians that avoids leather at all costs in fact he refuses to buy leather shoes and even asked for the leather interior in his lexus car to be swapped for cloth

3992680 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3992681 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3992682 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3992683 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3992684 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3992685 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3992686 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3992688 the deceleration in export growth was the main reason for the slowdown in industrial output

3992693 el respeto del derecho de los cubanos que viven en el exterior a venir a cuba por parte del gobierno del pa s donde vivan no debe condicionarse a los cambios en cuba pues esto ser a redoblar el castigo a la misma v ctima pero los propios cubanos que viven fuera de cuba deben ser solidarios con sus hermanos y reclamar todos los derechos de los cubanos que vivimos aqu pues as est n reclamando los derechos propios
3992694 si el miedo les alcanza hasta all afuera y creen que deben pagar con el precio del silencio si no el de la complacencia simulada para que les permitan entrar como visitantes a su propio pa s entonces s lo contribuir n a la prolongaci n de la humillaci n de todos
3992695 si no lo consideran as a adi miren el pasaporte con que salieron de cuba y expl quense por qu dice salida definitiva
3992696 la condici n indiscutible de cubanos de todos los exiliados cubanos o emigrantes por cualquier causa y de sus hijos y por tanto todos sus derechos como ciudadanos cubanos
3992697 la ley proclama el fin de la categor a de castigo salida definitiva el fin de las confiscaciones o despojos de las propiedades de los cubanos que emigren a partir de ese momento esa ley liquida tambi n todas las humillantes discriminaciones que sufrimos los cubanos en nuestro propio pa s
3992698 nosotros continuaremos desde aqu luchando por los derechos de todos tambi n los de nuestra querida e inseparable familia de cubanos de la di spora que es la misma familia cubana

3992701 el proyecto pretende aportar a la zona un mbito natural de gran espiritualidad mariana para desarrollar actividades culturales retiros misas de sanaci n y un espacio para la meditaci n la lectio divina y la oraci n
3992702 quiz en nuestros d as el escenario ha cambiado lo mismo que las dimensiones del lago y de la misma barca la iglesia en donde estamos m s de mil millones de seguidores de cristo pero las tormentas son las mismas y las decisiones a tomar tambi n deben ser las mismas
3992703 es cierto que en el anuncio del evangelio debemos poner tanto entusiasmo como si todo dependiera de nuestro esfuerzo y de nuestras capacidades pero sin olvidar nunca que sin l nada podemos hacer con la firme convicci n de que no es nuestra barca sino su barca
3992704 siempre que va a iniciar algo importante en su vida jes s se concentra en la oraci n
3992705 si recorremos la historia podemos constatar que siempre ha habido dificultades y que nunca han faltado tormentas a la iglesia sin embargo la traves a ya lleva dos mil a os sin que hasta ahora se haya hundido la nave
3992706 besa tu crucifijo y ver s que la vida no es tr gica
3992707 donde pude ver una multitud alegre piadosa con una fe en que el se or escucha su oraci n y de recibir con gran alegr a la bendici n de dios
3992708 bendita gente bendito pueblo el nuestro que tiene ese amor a la cruz esa fe a sus obispos y esa confianza que jes s nos ha dejado esas huellas en esta religiosidad del pueblo la cruz de motupe
3992709 hay que vencer una grave tentaci n de la cual nos advert a el recordado juan pablo ii
3992710 si queremos amar no tengamos miedo al dolor la cruz es entregar la vida a nuestro hermano la cruz es m s fuerte que el odio y que la venganza la cruz nos dice que no hay fracaso sino esperanza la cruz nos dice que el amor no tiene fronteras que dios siempre es m s grande incluso cuando has fracasado el dolor en cristo en la cruz nos sigue diciendo que todo lo que tiene valor cuesta
3992711 esa cruz es de amor y la encontramos d a a d a en lugar de hacer las cosas por quedar bien o por evitar una discusi n hag moslas por amor a cristo y por eso que buena costumbre es tener un crucifijo siempre a la mano en nuestra habitaci n y acordarnos que desde esa cruz el se or nos ama nos llama nos consuela y nos anima
3992712 la lucha contra el sida y la iglesia cat lica
3992713 la enfermedad ha alcanzado cifras alarmantes m s de 33 millones de contagiados han muerto m s de 2 millones de personas en 2007 y en ese mismo a o lo han contra do de nuevo 2 5 millones de personas
3992714 no puede decirse recuerda que la iglesia cat lica se desentiende del tema como en tantas otras enfermedades incluso contagiosas el amor de cristo ha llevado a atender con riesgo de la propia vida a las personas afectadas
3992715 la postura m s frecuente es la de propiciar el sexo seguro mediante el uso del preservativo la iglesia cat lica sin embargo propone otros caminos m s positivos y eso le lleva a situarse contracorriente buscando el bien integral de las personas el preservativo es un tap n no siempre eficaz la propuesta debe llevar a educar en el amor verdadero
3992716 en este campo del sida como en todos los que incluyen el recto uso de la sexualidad la iglesia presenta la propuesta del amor verdadero que lleva consigo una buena educaci n en la virtud de la castidad
3992717 no se puede proponer a los adolescentes y j venes el uso sin freno de su propia sexualidad en aras de una mayor libertad eso de entrada gusta a los o dos pero por este camino el hombre se hace esclavo de sus propios ego smos y no aprender nunca a amar de verdad
3992718 curiosamente las cifras de contagio del sida se disparan con estas propuestas por este camino vamos a la ruina moral
3992719 experiencias concretas como la de uganda donde a trav s de los hospitales cat licos se ha puesto en pr ctica esta propuesta han reducido las cifras del sida del 80 al 10 ning n otro programa ha conseguido una reducci n tan dr stica
3992720 la soluci n de sida vendr por atenerse al plan de dios
3992721 no vemos que la pena de muerte inhiba absolutamente a nadie de cometer delito habr a que analizar el tema de la cadena perpetua si no es un tema que vulnere podr amos aceptarla
3992722 los cr menes y la violencia siguen siendo estratosf ricos pues ni os de 14 a os de edad han masacrado a sus compa eros
3992723 la pena de muerte es la pena sobre la pena misma es decir estar amos acudiendo a lo que es la venganza y cu ndo vamos a terminar si t matas a un criminal va a haber un sentido de odio y de venganza y va a ser una cadena de nunca acabar
3992724 la pr xima semana la apa podr a adoptar un nuevo informe sobre la relaci n entre el aborto y los problemas de salud como la depresi n el nuevo estudio de noruega reconfirma lo que las mujeres en estados unidos ya saben bastante bien el aborto no termina con los problemas genera otros nuevos la apa necesita ignorar la presi n pol tica y debe informar sobre el resultado final y doloroso del aborto
3992725 el aborto no solo termina la vida del beb sino que altera la de la madre la apa no puede seguir ignorando estudio tras estudio y pretender que la eliminaci n de un ni o de tu vida est libre de consecuencias ser a interesante ver si es que los abortistas siguen rechazando estas realidades cuando los psic logos se re nan la pr xima semana

3992747 medical blogs have the opportunity to be such a benefit to patients
3992748 by revealing the struggles we have they can really open patients eyes to how to interact with doctors they can connect patients and nurses who can be isolated from each other and they can be an important source of information for doctors as well as patients

3992793 that its not the same its not the person i thought
3992794 i think we should design campaigns that appeal not to 51 percent of the people
3992795 do my part in fixing fissures that i may have been part of
3992796 everyone is going to reflect on the good and the bad and everything in between in their own way

3992912 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings
3992913 its like an egg toss if you move your hand backward as you catch the egg and increase the time of contact over which the impact occurs the impact will be less forceful and the egg will not break it is the same phenomenon experienced in catching a baseball
3992914 our studies with carbon nanotubes have been ongoing for quite some time each step along the way has led to the next breakthrough and each time weve learned more about how they grow and what their applications could be we believe that carbon nanotubes have tremendous potential for the lives of each one of us

3992919 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3992920 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3992921 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3992922 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3992923 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3992924 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3992925 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3992926 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3992927 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3992928 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3992929 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3992930 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3992931 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3992932 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3992948 the wind farm will cover between six and 10 properties
3992949 the area has really good internal wind speed is near a transmission network a network that distributes power and from the fauna and flora perspective its quite benign theres no flora or fauna of great significance its cattle grazing land

3992995 hes not suitable for breaststroke hes more of a freestyle guy
3992996 kitajima is the breaststroke guy the japanese swimmer became the first man to sweep both breaststroke events at consecutive olympics with a resounding victory in the 200 meters thursday
3992997 i was not thinking about winning two gold medals at two consecutive olympics
3992998 i was focusing on these games i wanted to show my best performance here in beijing and i knew if i could do that the rest would come with it
3992999 i wanted to improve my world record that why i had some mixed feelings but i won and thats what is most important
3993000 my race was the first one of the day if this event was held later on i had the chance to set a better time
3993001 i was going to set the record if id had the race at about 11 00 i was so calm i think i could have seen each face in this venue
3993002 the breaststroke is phelps weakest and he usually only swims it in the individual medley kitajima invited duboscq to train with him earlier this year and he said the frenchman deserved a bow for pushing him to new heights
3993003 we spent two weeks training together in japan and thats one of the big reasons for my improvement i became a more patient and focused swimmer

3993011 no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
3993012 while the so called religious issue is necessarily and properly the chief topic here tonight i want to emphasize from the outset that i believe that we have far more critical issues in the 1960 campaign the spread of communist influence until it now festers only 90 miles from the coast of florida the humiliating treatment of our president and vice president by those who no longer respect our power the hungry children i saw in west virginia the old people who cannot pay their doctors bills the families forced to give up their farms an america with too many slums with too few schools and too late to the moon and outer space
3993013 well i hurt like hell and im annoyed that lord scimitar tried to sidetrack us for absolutely nothing but i guess i am ok
3993014 oh yeah and the cruel gorthaurists basically suggested that we were fools if we were one hundred percent certain that their leader was dead
3993015 that is the last thing we need to have that lunatic roaming around this castle looking for a piece of you
3993016 im in no mood right now to be playing any of his sick games
3993017 like it or not i think they are slowly forcing us to play their game
3993018 first we have sovereign flat out telling us to watch out because we never know if even our friends could be him in disguise now we have lavos hinting at the second coming of gorthaur or maybe it is still the first because he also cast doubt on whether he really died in the first place let me tell you what i am thinking right now the more that i stay in this place the more that i hate it i dont like what is going through my mind i dont like the fact that we are racing against the clock and i dont like the fact that there are some idiots upstairs that are probably watching all of this and getting a good laugh out of it
3993019 come on shoe get a grip on yourself before you lose it again
3993020 this is the point where we need to start blocking out all of the crap they are trying to put into our heads to throw us off our game we really need to start moving again and i didnt bow down before lord scimitar so that i could spend a half hour talking with you no offense but if i didnt do it for him it doesnt mean that i want to shoot the breeze with you either dont let my sacrifice be for nothing
3993021 lets go i dont think anything is broken and those three dudes hit like girls anyway
3993022 i didnt want to say that to their faces because they were very apt to turn me into a girl with all of the powers that they possess
3993023 im guessing that we need to go through the way that they busted into the room now
3993024 i find it kind of weird though they came through that way but they didnt leave that way
3993025 i would say that they have something cooking through that path and whatever it is they want it to be left untouched and also for us to be the first to discover it
3993026 or i could be completely wrong and that path leads right into a trap door with a pit of spikes waiting at the bottom
3993027 expect the worst and hope for the best that seems to be the way to go in this hell hole
3993028 shoe you have the honors of leading us through that nice new path that was opened up for us
3993029 why is it that you are suddenly deferring to me
3993030 well since everything so far is either jumping out at you or pointing their weapons at you the instant that they get you in their sights then we need to use that to our advantage
3993031 if you are flushing them out then i need to follow right behind and put a serious hurting on them think of it as a football game shoe you are the lead blocker now and i am the running back that is planning on running over the unsuspecting foes that are coming after us
3993032 tell me you just didnt throw a football analogy in my face right after i just got my ass kicked and we are racing against the clock
3993033 some people wonder how i know you are the one and only maverick this is one of the reasons why i dont doubt my instincts
3993034 a coward dies a thousand deaths but a hero dies only once
3993035 now i understand the meaning of that saying but what the hell is it doing here of all places
3993036 i dont understand why someone would take the time to do this and then to do it with blood
3993037 dont wonder too much because i see more blood on that door straight ahead
3993038 to continue from here you must be prepared to sacrifice a life
3993039 there is something about those words that is really bothering me right now
3993040 i could interpret it by saying that i am always ready to lay down my own life to save one of my friends
3993041 that is good enough for me to open that door
3993042 we dont really have a choice unless we want to stand here and let the time expire on our chance to save our friends
3993043 then take a deep breath and be ready for absolutely anything when i open this door
3993044 think quickly because you dont have much time who do you save
3993045 dont go into this half cocked with hair on fire killing aint the easiest thing in the world
3993046 what you sayin that if i kill someone that it is going to give me nightmares or somethin

3993083 i guess she wasnt looking but the car was right next to us
3993084 the wheels were crooked and the doors were jammed we had to climb out of the windows
3993085 our other friends saw what happened and pulled over obviously
3993086 you know you have your friends lives in your hands and you almost killed them
3993087 there were other cars around so were pretty lucky we didnt hit anyone else
3993088 the worst thing we can do is be in a hurry
3993089 its better to do it right than fast where more could get injured
3993090 its a complicated situation but weve determined that saving houses did not outweigh the casualty risk
3993091 im pissed off that ive been out here for 13 hours and havent got to search
3993092 but at the same time if its that bad its better to do what theyre doing
3993093 i always hear soldiers dogging the air force but they sure are quick to call in close air support from air force jets
3993094 the atmosphere at those shows is awesome just non stop dancing all night long
3993095 sometimes an entire week is devoted to following one band
3993096 if umphreys is playing a show in chicago one night and then in milwaukee the next why not make a road trip out of it
3993097 why do you think there are so many drugs being taken at these shows
3993098 hippies are just people who think they can do a lot of drugs and have no responsibilities
3993099 most of them dont even have values of a true hippie they just create everything they claim to hate
3993100 i consider my son a complete hippie but thats just because he listens to the same music i did in the 60s and chooses to shower only once a week he doesnt give a hoot about trees or slaughtered animals
3993101 i cant blame the icy road or even god for what happened to my brother
3993102 i can only blame him for making a horrible decision
3993103 i was only 15 years old when i lost jeff im now older than he was when he died
3993104 thats what i want these kids to realize is how they still have an entire life to live
3993105 i wish people knew that when they kill themselves they kill everyone that loves them too
3993106 i also wish ryan would have told someone he was sad because there were a lot of people there to help him
3993107 its great that the school is trying to help us
3993108 but although i can say that i will listen for some kids it might just go in one ear and out the other like any other class would
3993109 the kids need a program like this so they can learn how to help one another
3993110 because most of the time theyre not talking to adults
3993111 if she would have been wearing a seatbelt she probably would have stayed in the car
3993112 its just something people have to get in the habit of i promise its not hard

3993128 the properties are cattle properties so the wind farm wont change the use of the land and the landowners will get some money
3993129 we had overwhelming support for the project from the community and the local council with really no objections
3993130 the wind farm will cover between six and 10 properties
3993131 i dont think it would be too much of a leap to say that you have the same sorts of problems with violence in pregnancy in australia
3993132 three quarters of the women who experienced violence during the pregnancy had also experienced violence from the partner prior to the pregnancy as well
3993133 it could be that if you are in a violent situation you are less likely to be sure that you want to have a baby

3993143 they were just part of that era when architecture went to extremes
3993144 it was in real bad shape when we started and we did a tremendous amount of work
3993145 it was challenging and at first we had a very good time
3993146 the neighborhood makes it really difficult to keep the house up
3993147 as happens in that neighborhood unfortunately when new ownerships are not quite as fit as the previous one its downward step by step and thats what happened here
3993148 its another for the inspections department to have the manpower to get out there and actually do it
3993149 i think it has a great chance of being sold
3993150 i hope it will appeal to a preservationist who will restore it

3993213 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks
3993214 the relationship between russia and the west is long and complicated there have been many turning points for good and ill this is another turning point let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past

3993222 gm crops are not to blame for climate change the industrialization of agriculture the spread of dysfunctional conurbations the salinization of australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the prince appears to accuse them

3993230 not a safety issue my arse these aircraft may have been flying for up to five years with missing parts
3993231 it fails to take into account that qantas as is always the case received the approval of boeing and casa for this work before it was undertaken
3993232 all modifications qantas performed on the boeing 737 aircraft were to a standard specifically approved by boeing and casa
3993233 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past regular lubrication and checking of the jack screw is vital because corrosion poses a real risk and must be eliminated to prevent this key component from seizing up
3993234 boeing issued a directive that this component needed to be checked more rigorously and more regularly
3993235 there was a maintenance issue involving the lubrication of a jack screw on a boeing 747 400 qantas found this through a routine check of our maintenance records
3993236 the jack screw had been inspected and the aircraft will operate tomorrow
3993237 there is no connection at all with any other aircraft incident
3993238 the alaska incident involved a different aircraft type and design with different safety features

3993253 australia is concerned that despite the announcement of a ceasefire agreement which commits both sides to a cessation of all hostilities and the withdrawal of troops to positions held before the conflict broke out there have been reports of ongoing military action by russian forces
3993254 australia calls on russia to honour the terms of the ceasefire respect the territorial integrity of georgia and resolve its differences with georgia through peaceful means
3993255 the military action taken by russia has been disproportionate and has resulted in widespread damage and heavy casualties
3993256 a further 500 000 has been allocated to the international committee of the red cross icrc for the immediate provision of medical supplies to hospitals and the deployment of field hospitals for critical surgery in gori and south ossetia
3993257 were asking for the publics help because as well as the cost to business its the public who are affected by disruptions to services when people steal copper in this manner
3993258 there are arrangements through the organisation austrac to follow money trails once you know what the money is being used for
3993259 i dont think we need legislation we just need authorities to pay attention and in particular we need the public to help the police identify theft at the time when its actually taking place
3993260 for 63 years i had no reason to believe i would ever find out what happened to my father
3993261 i virtually had no hope of ever knowing what happened to my dad
3993262 i wouldnt say ive processed it i think im still a little shell shocked by it all
3993263 i dont know that the military even looked for him
3993264 i guess they figured he was gone and thats about it
3993265 im just so proud of him and what he did for his country
3993266 anything i can do to see he gets the honors he deserves thats what im working for

3993268 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
3993269 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3993270 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3993271 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3993272 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
3993273 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3993274 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3993275 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3993276 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
3993277 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3993278 ich gehe davon aus dass die russen verstanden haben dass ein berspannen des bogens tiefgreifende konsequenzen f r ihre stellung im internationalen staatensystem haben wird
3993279 wir verstehen im gro en und ganzen dass die usa die f hrung des landes georgien als spezielles projekt auffasst
3993280 die lage in gori ist im gro en und ganzen ruhig

3993284 the name of his circus was victoria circus and my name is victoria it was a sign
3993285 i went to a regular school and i decided i wanted to work in the circus
3993286 were in a family environment and we try to entertain other families

3993297 i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can if i can do that ill be fine
3993298 the most important thing is being able to separate the two events and just move on ive trained for it im used to it the biggest part for me in the psychological part
3993299 what a great way to finish with a gold medal and a world record
3993300 for us to break the record by so far is amazing i really look back to sitting back and cheering for the aussies
3993301 i did my best and ran out of room at the end
3993302 it definitely gives me more motivation im a little bit tired and i have a full day to recover
3993303 i cant believe it after the relay i could have sunk but i told myself that after all these years of hard work i cant let myself go down my legs were shaking at the start i was really tense just like the other seven guys
3993304 its a new generation and its now time to step aside they did a great job im from the previous generation
3993305 i was so calm that i think i could have seen each face in this venue
3993306 so to go out there and accomplish a medal is really exciting it doesnt top the relay medal but its something ive been pushing for for years
3993307 other than that things that happened in philly happened three years ago i dont know what the deal is with me being in the news from mcnabb i am happy here i am scoring touchdowns i have scored as many touchdowns in just as many games with tony romo as i did with them i dont know what the problem is
3993308 due to recent achievement in production of graphene nanoribbon this proposal may be implementable within the present techniques
3993309 its amazing how far she has come in six years and its like shes completing the cycle coming from a reality show having a hugely successful career and now shes judging future stars
3993310 the great thing about cheryl is that she knows exactly what the contestants are going through because she has been there and done it so can offer them all really good advice and empathise with how they feel
3993311 i just love all the banter we have on the judging panel
3993312 simon and i are the two old blokes who like a particular style of music then you have dannii and cheryl who obviously have completely different music tastes so it makes for an interesting day as we are always bickering over acts and who we all prefer not to mention all the fun we have in between filming
3993313 could really help things here and in four or five other states in the midwest
3993314 with jobs and the economy on the front burner especially in michigan i cant think of a better pick
3993315 would speak volumes to us and would instantly give him all of our efforts
3993316 i think social conservatives would not only support romney but support him enthusiastically
3993317 ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice
3993318 inflation may peak in november december and slip into single digit by march 2009 going by the current price situation there may be another round of monetary tightening
3993319 the uncertain oil prices make it difficult to make short term predictions but in the next 12 months the inflation rate would return to normal levels of 5 6

3993325 the key is to create content that keeps him out there
3993326 the challenge for olympic athletes has always been to be able after the post game hype to translate that into big marketing and endorsement deal dollars
3993327 theres no question that michael is an important driver of interest in the olympics
3993328 but the olympics turn out to be more than michael phelps
3993329 if anyone can transcend the limited shelf life of olympians its phelps
3993330 its always been an impediment to these folks going on because the glory is supposed to be enough

3993332 and if someone isnt that facile with the english language like weissmuller well you just make him tarzan
3993333 the key is to create content that keeps him out there
3993334 the challenge for olympic athletes has always been to be able after the post game hype to translate that into big marketing and endorsement deal dollars
3993335 weve started conversations about it and i think in the next 30 or 60 days well be able to talk completely about that
3993336 its such a privilege to serve as president of this academy its a dynamic time for our organisation and our art form im incredibly proud to be part of it
3993337 there is at least one more chapter we ultimately want to see the characters make it back to new york
3993338 a lot of people have no idea they have diabetes
3993339 the classic symptoms are peeing too much theyre very thirsty theyre losing weight its very common to see that presentation
3993340 the key thing is the relationship of diabetes to all these other problems
3993341 weve always seen a huge proportion of patients with diabetes
3993342 thats one thing we really try to emphasize with our patients its something you can take control over if you make some lifestyle changes
3993343 these classes are not supplemental but are an integral part in their health care
3993344 of course not everyone has the time to come to an additional health education class but for our diabetic patients its essential
3993345 now i only eat one a day before i ate three or four for lunch and four or five for dinner
3993346 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3993347 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3993348 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3993349 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3993350 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3993351 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3993352 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3993353 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3993354 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3993355 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3993356 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3993357 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3993358 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3993359 we were very lucky to have got away with a draw very lucky not to have conceded goals
3993360 it was a very disappointing performance but the team know they have to improve and i did not have to say much to them in the dressing room sometimes you do not need many words
3993361 it will be different at anfield there we are expected to win and we will have our own fans behind us liege had their very noisy fans for the first leg
3993362 we were not surprised by the fine performance of the liege side we had seen enough of them to know they were a good aggressive side
3993363 the real surprise for me was the way liverpool played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
3993364 we will have to be a lot better in the second leg at anfield much better
3993365 we have been playing well in pre season looking confident and passing the ball well
3993366 but we did not do any of those things i did not want to bring steven gerrard on because the doctors had told me he was not fit enough to start the match
3993367 we waited until well into the second half before using him but we were not controlling the game and i had to bring him on
3993368 we know we can always rely on pepe to stop penalties but we have been told that the other effort may have been behind the line but these things happen
3993369 liverpool maybe came here asleep and not expecting this sort of game
3993370 maybe though we have woken them up for the second leg which will me much harder for us
3993371 we felt that if we did not lose this leg we would still be in with a chance we know though that we still have to score and that could be the problem
3993372 but i want to praise my team they attacked liverpool from the start and when their goalkeeper pulled the ball back from behind the line maybe the referee was asleep too
3993373 we were a very young team and we did not lose our nerve did not panic
3993374 in the end maybe our technical superiority allowed us to score two goals that is a massive advantage for the second leg but we will be on our toes
3993375 they imposed a very physical game on us with man marking all over the pitch they did that with a lot of belief and spirit
3993376 they have given so much in the first half they could not keep the same pace and tightness in their marking
3993377 you saw a performance of great spirit and arsenal were rattled they know they have been in a game
3993378 it just showed our inexperience in europe in key moments and key occasions that we lost this game
3993379 we have a hell of a mountain to climb now but we just need to put in another good performance
3993380 both those contracts and discussions have been put on the shelf
3993381 the season is starting and those will be re visited next year
3993382 this contract will take me to 34 and if you look around there are a lot of top professionals playing like ryan giggs players like that offering a lot to their club both on the pitch and off it
3993383 and i certainly feel that i can do that in a big way
3993384 yes the manchester united game and what they did there i sat and watched that game with my family and what they did there it was a very emotional moment
3993385 i will never forget it i cant speak highly enough of the lads and what they did john terry as a captain creates that kind of spirit among the lads and the others follow because they are all great lads
3993386 when you go to your mums funeral you dont expect all the players to go there you might expect a representative from the club i had all the lads there and thats something that goes beyond football and shows you what real men are and what real friendships are
3993387 i made my decision for frank lampard simple as that i want to do what is best for me my family and my football
3993388 all i can say is that he is one of the best managers in the world hes shown that when he was here and i have no doubts he will be successful in the future wherever he goes
3993389 hes a winner that is his future and this is my future
3993390 the continuous monitoring of what she eats and her blood levels is an incredible job
3993391 he understands that there are a lot of children that suffer from the same condition that arent as lucky as her
3993392 this new funding that starts in october is going to build on our previous research but it has more of a lifespan focus
3993393 the special olympics does screenings for thousands of people around the world and were going to be working with them to look at some of that screening data
3993394 the special olympics population is very much a convenience sample for uic
3993395 more things are brought to you by prayers than you can imagine
3993396 do see the world in red yellow and blue max lines daydream about bike boulevards and bridges while riding the streetcar want a chance to contribute to important transportation work being done in public service if so apply today to assist commissioner sam adams team at city hall as our new transportation staff associate this is a part time unpaid position is responsible for keeping up with sams transportation agenda and will work closely with sam and his transportation liaison
3993397 and in the bus service it has one that exceeds most there are many aspects that need to be improved of course but we need improvements targeted towwards real issues not supposed ones that attepmt to prove a specious argument
3993398 the purpose is to figure out how memories are actually stored in a biological brain
3993399 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spinoffs
3993400 within about 24 hours they start sending out feelers to each other and making connections
3993401 within a week we get some spontaneous firings and brain like activity
3993402 now we are looking at how best to teach it to behave in certain ways
3993403 this one is a bit boisterous and active while we know another is not going to do what we want it to
3993404 this is a simplified version of what goes on in the human brain where we can look and control the basic features in the way that we want in a human brain you cant really do that
3993405 the project gives us a unique opportunity to look at something which may exhibit complex behaviours but still remain closely tied to the activity of individual neurons
3993406 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3993407 there can be no talks with the organizers of genocide
3993408 saakashvili was crazy enough to go in the middle of the night and bomb a city
3993409 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3993410 the rocky horror phenomenon has a life of its own that has reincarnated itself in numerous ways since its birth
3993411 our hope has always been that each new endeavor and rebirth will expose the rocky horror experience to new audiences and expand the fan base
3993412 i have no view on whether it should be remade but it doesnt have my blessing
3993413 the deceleration in export growth was the main reason for the slowdown in industrial output
3993414 a rise in enterprise production costs have also impacted industrial output
3993415 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
3993416 for another two days russian troops will remain in the gori region to transfer control to georgian police and then they will leave
3993417 we still have diplomatic relations with georgia we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia
3993418 but we wont directly talk to saakashvili we wont do that we offered him peace but not friendship
3993419 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3993420 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict
3993421 the shocking plight of young children revealed by the mullighan inquiry into child sexual abuse in the apy lands demanded immediate and urgent action by the south australian and australian governments to protect children
3993422 the new complex will include office space for police officers specialising in domestic violence and sexual assault
3993423 it will also provide accommodation for specialists temporarily visiting the apy lands for investigations into abuse
3993424 the safe house will provide children and their family members who need to be removed from the community with safe accommodation and support
3993425 this facility will also be able to provide transition accommodation support and a safe return to community for children following child protection assessments and medical intervention
3993426 i have never imagined that i could win the gold in the olympic games
3993427 the last 50 metres was hard work it hurt quite a bit and the chinese girls swam an awesome race
3993428 i didnt feel pressure before the competition i tried to relax
3993429 in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about the others
3993430 we swam together and i felt like we were in training
3993431 the best moment is when i turned back and i saw the number one next to my name
3993432 its huge unbelievable at any moment i felt that i could be beaten
3993433 i was going ok until the last 50 metres and then i ran low on energy but it was a good swim and i am pleased with the time
3993434 the opportunity to get your foot in the door is so important
3993435 hes willing to back himself that he wont become a 2ic
3993436 thats going to be the biggest factor two years down the track does he become a 2ic to someone who is maybe a better name or younger after he does all the hard yakka and then finds himself handing the side over
3993437 hes an outstanding young bloke and i sincerely hope that he has the chance to coach an afl side
3993438 im sure hell do a terrific job in the next two seasons and then its up to the powers that be
3993439 we no longer collect any numbers things change too fast we dont know what to measure we do ethnographies and stuff to find out whats going on out there
3993440 you have just made this place even more monolithic and hbs is supposed to be the managers school
3993441 good lord you want me to trust the fate of the corporation to peter pan to a person who thinks its attractive to be all creative and crazy and out of touch with the world
3993442 to count beans or not to count beans that is the question
3993443 what are the cultural foundations and current trends that will shape this marketplace
3993444 its difficult to imagine a circumstance where the government could directly control interest rates without a whole range of adverse consequences occurring a whole range of other things
3993445 weve seen it in the past for example where we had a cap on interest rates
3993446 what that meant was that people ended up with cocktail loans for their homes where they borrowed a proportion of their mortgage at the official interest rate and had to borrow the rest at a really high interest rate much much higher than the official rate
3993447 now i wouldnt speculate about what they might be and of course its not my direct responsibility
3993448 well cross that bridge if and when we come to it if we believe that the banks are not doing the right thing then clearly we will be examining the options to put greater pressure on
3993449 but the banks will carry a very heavy onus to explain any variation from any reduction by the reserve bank in the rates as compared with what they actually do
3993450 they will have a very heavy onus to both the government and the community to explain that

3993458 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
3993459 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
3993460 every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around
3993461 if current trends continue we are likely to see the pass rate nudge over 97 per cent this year
3993462 in terms of a grades in 2002 it was 20 7 per cent and in 2007 it was 25 3 per cent
3993463 that means its risen by just short of 5 per cent in six years should that continue it will mean more than 26 per cent will get a grades this year
3993464 if you look at the trends there has been a big change in subjects over time if you take the ten years through to 2007 the big growth areas have been in media studies sports studies psychology and religious studies
3993465 but other subjects have been falling in popularity sharply like economics and french and german although there has been an increase in spanish
3993466 i think probably the fall in french and german is likely to continue because the numbers taking languages at gcse have been falling
3993467 there could be a number of reasons why spanish is becoming more popular spain is a popular holiday destination
3993468 all the way from the flagpole to the japanese garden

3993471 oil prices are high due to the fact of the recession in the united states and the economic crisis which has touched several countries a situation which has an effect on the devaluation of the dollar and therefore each time the dollar falls one percent the price of the barrel rises by 4 and of course vice versa

3993516 were asking for the publics help because as well as the cost to business its the public who are affected by disruptions to services when people steal copper in this manner
3993517 there are arrangements through the organisation austrac to follow money trails once you know what the money is being used for
3993518 i dont think we need legislation we just need authorities to pay attention and in particular we need the public to help the police identify theft at the time when its actually taking place
3993519 our peaceful action highlighted the rudd and bligh governments plans to rapidly expand coal exports when the world is trying to cut global emissions
3993520 it is contradictory and immoral for our political leaders to be expanding australias export coal industry whilst talking about urgent action on climate change
3993521 its a sparsely populated area so it does not affect many people
3993522 the properties are cattle properties so the wind farm wont change the use of the land and the landowners will get some money
3993523 we had overwhelming support for the project from the community and the local council with really no objections
3993524 the wind farm will cover between six and 10 properties
3993525 the area has really good internal wind speed is near a transmission network a network that distributes power and from the fauna and flora perspective its quite benign theres no flora or fauna of great significance its cattle grazing land
3993526 currently they are on track to receive their allotments by weeks end of gross payroll

3993539 im a young kid i heal relatively quick said lincecum who doesnt ice his arm after he pitches
3993540 we dont even have signs outside my intention is to spend one or two days a month down there my objective is to get close to the people who need services
3993541 ah good it will be a little quieter for a month i can catch up on all those things i never had time to do before
3993542 the new system will provide a step change in what we can predict
3993543 this more detailed modelling will help us predict with more accuracy particular types of events that could affect the public such as thunderstorms and flash floods
3993544 knowing where customers are also helps us to assist them in the event of disasters such as summer floods
3993545 we can establish the scale of the response and work to help our customers as quickly as possible
3993546 the way the geographical data is presented and the platforms it is going to connect with must be taken into consideration
3993547 companies may want to use the data for other software in areas such as customer services and renewals so integration must be carried out with caution as completely standalone outputs could create issues such as having to do manual lists and manage duplication
3993548 when companies are managing risk of crime related to a property location wrong use of data could have an adverse effect such as affecting house prices
3993549 at cfs we have a very old set of core banking technologies that were developed in the 1960s
3993550 those systems are becoming very expensive to support slow to get new products out to market on and cost us quite a lot of money when it comes to meeting regulatory requirements
3993551 we want to offer an integrated complete full service and to do that we need a more modern core platform
3993552 the way the business will manage the migration will be one of the most challenging aspects of this programme but risks will be mitigated by very detailed planning testing and having fallbacks at every stage
3993553 we will be very careful before doing a cutover to the new technology to be certain that we do not lose any data in the process
3993554 the key is to integrate the software into the environment and then migrate the business onto it
3993555 and if anything goes wrong we have an existing system that is stable to back us up
3993556 for me its all about confidence thats why i love my rosewood lipstick its super smooth super seductive and it complements my skin perfectly when i wear it i can do anything which shade makes you feel this sure

3993589 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
3993590 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle

3993606 absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3993607 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time

3993652 the john bull character was that of a drinking man hard headed down to earth averse to intellectualism fond of dogs horses ale and country sports during the napoleonic wars john bull became the national symbol of freedom of loyalty to king and country and of resistance to french aggression he was the ordinary man in the street who would fight napoleon with his bare hands if necessary by the 1800s he was seen as a more assertive figure in domestic politics as well prepared to criticise the royal family and the government giving those outside the traditional political process a voice john bull became so familiar that his name frequently appeared in books plays periodical titles and as a brand name or trademark although frequently used through world war ii john bull has been seen less often since the 1950s as uncle sam is the iconic representation of the united states so john bull is the personification of the character of the english honest generous straightforward with a zest for life and ready to stand up and fight for what he believes in

3993662 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3993663 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3993664 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make

3993695 als een stofzuiger heel stil is denken de mensen dat die niet werkt
3993696 toen de philips whirlpool wasmachines werden uitgerust met antigeluid een voorziening die door het produceren van geluid in tegenfase hinderlijk geluid kan onderdrukken kregen we veel wasmachines terug met kapot gerukte handels de machines waren zo stil geworden dat de mensen dachten dat ze het niet deden

3993702 barang siapa yang diberi petunjuk allah maka tidak ada yang dapat menyesatkannya dan barang siapa yang disesatkannya maka tidak ada seorangpun yang dapat memberinya petunjuk
3993703 ketahuilah bahwa sesungguhnya kehidupan dunia itu hanyalah permainan dan suatu yang melalaikan perhiasan dan bermegah megah antara kamu serta berbangga bangga tentang banyaknya harta dan anak seperti hujan yang tanam tanamannya mengagumkan para petani kemudian tanaman itu menjadi kering dan kamu lihat warnanya kuning kemudian menjadi hancur dan di akhirat nanti ada azab yang keras dan ampunan dari allah serta keridaan nya dan kehidupan dunia ini tidak lain hanyalah kesenangan yang menipu

3993715 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3993716 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3993717 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3993718 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3993719 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3993720 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3993721 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3993725 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3993726 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3993727 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3993728 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3993729 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3993735 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
3993736 for another two days russian troops will remain in the gori region to transfer control to georgian police and then they will leave
3993737 we still have diplomatic relations with georgia we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia
3993738 but we wont directly talk to saakashvili we wont do that we offered him peace but not friendship
3993739 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3993740 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict
3993741 i have never imagined that i could win the gold in the olympic games
3993742 the last 50 metres was hard work it hurt quite a bit and the chinese girls swam an awesome race
3993743 i didnt feel pressure before the competition i tried to relax
3993744 in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about the others
3993745 we swam together and i felt like we were in training
3993746 the best moment is when i turned back and i saw the number one next to my name
3993747 its huge unbelievable at any moment i felt that i could be beaten
3993748 i was going ok until the last 50 metres and then i ran low on energy but it was a good swim and i am pleased with the time
3993749 the shocking plight of young children revealed by the mullighan inquiry into child sexual abuse in the apy lands demanded immediate and urgent action by the south australian and australian governments to protect children
3993750 the new complex will include office space for police officers specialising in domestic violence and sexual assault
3993751 it will also provide accommodation for specialists temporarily visiting the apy lands for investigations into abuse
3993752 the safe house will provide children and their family members who need to be removed from the community with safe accommodation and support
3993753 its difficult to imagine a circumstance where the government could directly control interest rates without a whole range of adverse consequences occurring a whole range of other things
3993754 weve seen it in the past for example where we had a cap on interest rates
3993755 what that meant was that people ended up with cocktail loans for their homes where they borrowed a proportion of their mortgage at the official interest rate and had to borrow the rest at a really high interest rate much much higher than the official rate
3993756 now i wouldnt speculate about what they might be and of course its not my direct responsibility
3993757 well cross that bridge if and when we come to it if we believe that the banks are not doing the right thing then clearly we will be examining the options to put greater pressure on
3993758 but the banks will carry a very heavy onus to explain any variation from any reduction by the reserve bank in the rates as compared with what they actually do

3993768 maybe seo taiji sold his soul to the devil like myself
3993769 i also think that he is handsome he has not changed even after these years maybe its because he has also sold his soul to the devil like myself

3993778 its a huge situation for me after 35 years because ive wanted to bring one back
3993779 this whole thing unfolded about two weeks ago when these two boys came on a talk show here in the states and announced theyd found a bigfoot body
3993780 the commentator asked them if they could send someone to see the body and they said the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body is the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
3993781 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there
3993782 i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being
3993783 we trekked in for a day a half what kind of lunatic would be out here in a monkey suit i saw the thing i touched it
3993784 theyre fine guys one works for the police department in georgia and the other was a correctional officer theyre pretty credible guys
3993785 well release the dna analysis and well have the body right next to the two boys then you can see its real that its not all bullshit

3993789 we commend the cambodian government for the impressive strides it has taken to increase transparency and dialogue with the private sector
3993790 we have a very robust trade relationship building on the bilateral trade agreement as well as the us trade and investment framework agreement
3993791 a great deal of importance on strengthening and deepening our bilateral relationship
3993792 implementing wto commitments strengthening the ipr intellectual property rights regime and improving the business climate
3993793 we in the us also dialogue very closely between the government and the private sector we value transparency and the ability of the public and the private sector to provide comment on trade policy
3993794 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
3993795 political stability in my view can only be brought through a reconciliation approach as opposed to confrontation
3993796 the era of repression is over forever dictatorship has become a tale of the past
3993797 the war against extremism and terrorism is a war for our own survival
3993798 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
3993799 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
3993800 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
3993801 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3993802 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3993803 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3993804 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3993805 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
3993806 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
3993807 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
3993808 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3993809 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3993810 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3993811 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3993812 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
3993813 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
3993814 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
3993815 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
3993816 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
3993817 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours

3993819 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
3993820 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
3993821 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
3993822 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
3993823 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
3993824 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
3993825 look john kerry has been vetted he ran for president i think he would be a strong choice hed be a good choice especially in the context of foreign policy
3993826 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis

3993831 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3993832 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3993833 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3993834 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3993835 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3993836 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3993837 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3993838 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
3993839 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
3993840 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
3993841 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
3993842 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
3993843 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
3993844 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
3993845 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
3993846 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
3993847 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
3993848 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3993849 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs

3993853 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3993854 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3993855 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3993856 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3993857 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3993858 just so you all know we did set a record
3993859 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3993860 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3993861 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3993862 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3993863 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country

3993866 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs

3993871 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
3993872 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3993873 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3993874 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3993875 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3993876 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3993877 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3993878 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3993879 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3993880 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3993881 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3993882 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3993883 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3993884 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months

3993886 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3993887 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3993888 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
3993889 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
3993890 these are all small things and they all add up
3993891 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3993892 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3993893 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3993894 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3993895 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3993896 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3993897 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3993898 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3993899 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3993900 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3993901 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3993902 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3993903 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3993904 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3993905 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3993906 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3993907 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3993908 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

3993912 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3993913 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3993914 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3993915 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3993916 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3993917 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3993918 asumir el aumento del gasto social por prestaciones de desempleo y mantener el esfuerzo inversor en las actividades fundamentales para la actividad econ mica
3993919 resolver bien esta crisis y saldr de ella con una posici n m s reforzada siempre con la implicaci n de los agentes sociales

3993922 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3993923 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3993924 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3993925 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3993926 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3993927 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3993928 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3993929 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3993930 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3993931 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3993932 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3993933 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3993934 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3993935 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3993936 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3993937 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3993938 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3993939 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3993940 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3993941 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3993942 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3993943 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3993944 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3993945 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3993946 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3993947 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3993948 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3993949 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3993950 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3993951 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3993952 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3993953 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3993954 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3993955 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3993956 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3993957 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal

3993962 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
3993963 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
3993964 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
3993965 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
3993966 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
3993967 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
3993968 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3993969 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
3993970 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
3993971 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
3993972 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
3993973 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
3993974 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3993975 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
3993976 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3993977 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3993978 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3993979 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3993980 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3993981 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3993982 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3993983 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3993984 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3993985 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3993986 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3993987 our results suggest that when intimacy ebbs doubts about the relationship emerge making emerging adults aware of how romantic associations inevitably pose a threat to a persons subjective well being might help them to form more realistic romantic relationship goals
3993988 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3993989 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable

3993993 very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
3993994 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3993995 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells

3994000 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3994001 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3994002 asus is always committed to bring customers the most innovative solutions that helps to simplify usage experience while enjoying the best performance
3994003 with express gate users will enjoy instant internet access with new levels of fast speed and ease of use like never before
3994004 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3994005 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3994006 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3994007 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3994008 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3994009 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3994010 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3994011 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3994012 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3994013 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3994014 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3994015 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3994016 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3994017 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3994018 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3994019 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3994020 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3994021 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3994022 described as a cross between keith olbermann and bill maher with a black perspective
3994023 an activist for the naacp and people for the american way
3994024 will also air barack obamas speech accepting the democratic presidential nomination on aug 28 live just like its competitor tv one neither network however is airing john mccains acceptance speech
3994025 scientific study of the behavior of individuals in response to their social environment
3994026 two or more independent individuals who influence one another through social interaction
3994027 the careful exchange of information before and after a decision
3994028 as research has repeatedly shown teams are regularly in danger of being led down the wrong path because of uncritical unreflecting and unquestioning follower ship
3994029 learned predisposition to respond in a consistently favorable or unfavorable manner with respect to a particular object
3994030 incident reports quality reports route checks quality audits and flight operations data analysis programmed
3994031 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3994032 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3994033 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3994034 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3994035 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3994036 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3994037 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3994038 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3994039 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3994040 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3994041 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3994042 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3994043 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3994044 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3994045 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3994046 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3994047 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3994048 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3994049 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3994050 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3994051 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3994052 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3994053 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3994054 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3994055 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3994056 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3994057 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3994058 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3994059 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3994060 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3994061 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3994062 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3994063 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3994064 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3994065 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3994066 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3994067 the siding was the first to go then they took the fence then they broke in and took everything else
3994068 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means

3994070 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
3994071 lift the stone and drop it on ones own foot
3994072 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3994073 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3994074 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3994075 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3994076 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the citizens see it here
3994077 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3994078 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3994079 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3994080 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3994081 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3994082 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3994083 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3994084 your ambitions havent all come to fruition but that doesnt mean youve failed
3994085 what fraction of my life is spent on not bullshiting
3994086 starting the marathon deal four years ago was like starting a whole new relationship again
3994087 it gives us something in common that we can share
3994088 hes a good sport about whatever it is i get involved with
3994089 each of them is always enthusiastic motivated and has a smile on their face
3994090 it appears that they have been infected by the marathon virus and have spread it around among their friends and acquaintances we know that they serve as an inspiration to their family friends and training team members they certainly inspire us
3994091 i just could not believe he got ahead of me
3994092 its talking to the people before the race and during the race im slower than karen and dont pay as much attention to time
3994093 when we get out and do a marathon we do not feel like we are older at a time when many of our friends our own age have retired either on or off the job we are meeting and out there interacting with persons a lot younger
3994094 we cant imagine looking forward to 30 more years of resting and retirement
3994095 it is important to take stock of situation there will be options out there that suits their personal and career plan
3994096 i sit here now and look at my life and how lost i really am no one else would see the depth of my confusion well confusion isnt quite the word i cant place it right now
3994097 im sad without her even though i dont even know who she is ill try to look but i really dont think ill even know her for years

3994102 you dont see that very often where theres some walks and a lot of hit batters but i think at that point in the game we definitely would take it
3994103 that was big for us because i think zito was doing real well today he was changing speeds and doing great we kind of got in the way of some balls
3994104 at the time i didnt really feel like it was that crazy
3994105 now looking back on it when you think about it it does seem a little odd i didnt realize we had three hit batsmen
3994106 we scored a bunch of runs and didnt hardly have any hits
3994107 i told your mother you were going to be ok i just knew
3994108 i think this is about something we have no personal choice in i think its about fate
3994109 where you innovate how you innovate and what you innovate are design problems

3994111 mo has the ability to space the floor hes shown himself to be a good shooter
3994112 i like him hes a competitive player that can make big shots and one of those guys that is capable of rising to important times and obviously we want to be playing in those times
3994113 all these guys are very excited they respect mo as a player and theyre looking forward to playing with him
3994114 i think this is a move to be able to get a talented young 25 year old point guard that can be part of the future

3994116 they are dragging their feet in forcing these banks to reserve realistically some of these banks could have been shut two or three quarters earlier

3994161 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
3994162 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive

3994367 most of our skill guys are back mostly at the running back and wideout positions so its nice to have kids that understand the schemes we put alot of plays in and its just the first day of practice its been a good summer for us we did alot of 7 on 7 and we had good participation in the weight room alot of these kids have friday night experience
3994368 were going to play some teams early on that are non district non conference so it should help in the long run its alot of travelling for us we go to popular bluff in week three and we have to play harrisonville in week two the schedule is very tough but thats good because it prepares us for conference and district play

3994371 alot of people already have our expectations of being very high and that we have alot of experience coming back but in my opinion we dont have a whole lot coming back youve got a hole at center youve got a hole at quarterback and ryan spohrs the only back coming back with whole lot of experience and at receiver you dont have a whole lot of experience and defensively you only have two starters coming back in my opinion as head coach weve got alot of holes to fill but i gotta believe weve got some guys that are willing to step in and play
3994372 our underclassmen coaches do a great job of preparing these guys and we rotate them around theyre in their individual positions daily for 20 30 minutes with the varsity coaching staff we start preparing them as freshman to become seniors because in a very short amount of time those guys are going to be in your varsity games to us at notre dame our underclass is just as important as our varsity because one day those guys grow up and theyre the ones that represent you on friday nights there is pressure here the expectations are to win and theyre expected to represent our school in a positive manner

3994376 its getting tough alot of colleges are wanting an answer real quick but i just try to tell them i dont know what decision i want to make yet because its going to be one of the toughest decisions im going to have to make in my life
3994377 the transition has been an easy one for me considering i have spent the last 10 years with the same program the move has also been easy on my players because they know what i expect from them and vice a versa
3994378 our experience is not that great after all we graduated 19 players we have returners in key spots on defense and another returner in our qb jonathon nutt nutt earned all state honors last season while throwing over 2 500 yards
3994379 week 1 will be a good measuring stick to see how i have prepared my team in my first year as head coach the rivalry that has built up between macon and palmyra has grown a lot macons got a good coaching staff

3994441 i have to let him know this is not a game to see him pitch this is a game to win
3994442 we need the best outing from him because its about winning now its not the same situation when he was pitching last year
3994443 if carrasco starts then we lose him for four or five days
3994444 i think its important that the seventh and eighth innings before we get to bobby jenks to have those guys ready
3994445 i hope im michael young i hope i get to that level

3994449 i love them because i like to tell myself im more awake than everyone else
3994450 i wake up so excited to play and eager we basically have had two days off in between matches which is enough to give me a heart attack ive been dreaming of these norweigans for two nights it was great to finally see them
3994451 theres a reason they havent lost a match in more than a year
3994452 aside from passing i think we played ok but you have to pass
3994453 they aced me at least five times and that cant happen
3994454 well give him a shot next spring at least to be on the ballclub i like the way he plays i like the way he does stuff
3994455 i like those kids who fight all the way through the minor league system
3994456 line drive hitter i feel like i use some speed to my advantage i like hitting behind runners with a man at first
3994457 if i get caught up in that stuff it probably would get a little overbearing
3994458 im going to go out and hustle and put some good at bats together play some defense and hopefully i can make some sort of positive influence on the team hopefully i can stick around

3994461 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3994462 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3994463 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3994464 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3994465 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3994466 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3994467 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3994468 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3994469 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3994470 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3994471 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3994472 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3994473 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3994474 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3994475 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3994476 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3994477 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3994478 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3994479 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3994480 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3994481 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3994482 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3994483 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3994484 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3994485 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3994486 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3994487 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3994488 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3994489 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3994490 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3994491 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3994492 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3994493 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3994494 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3994495 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3994496 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3994497 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3994498 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3994499 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3994500 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3994501 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3994502 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3994503 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3994504 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3994505 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3994506 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3994507 and in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about others
3994508 and in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about others
3994509 we swam together and i felt like we were training
3994510 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3994511 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3994512 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3994513 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3994514 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3994515 he came back in about 6 30 p m friday armed and robbed the cashier
3994516 he left the scene driving a chevrolet ava lanche pickup truck
3994517 while the investigation was going on we received in formation that another store was hit in shorter right now we feel he is a suspect in that robbery as well
3994518 we had units on i 85 looking for him and he was never spotted
3994519 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3994520 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3994521 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3994522 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3994523 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3994524 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3994525 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3994526 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3994527 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3994528 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3994529 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3994530 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3994531 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3994532 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3994533 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3994534 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3994535 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3994536 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3994537 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3994538 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3994539 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3994540 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3994541 who are open to doing something on the production side
3994542 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3994543 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3994544 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3994545 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3994546 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3994547 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3994548 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3994549 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3994550 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3994551 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3994552 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3994553 i am beautiful even if i dont look like the woman next to me
3994554 conditions within rural and regional australia remain generally better than 12 months ago and agricultural markets remain strong
3994555 our assumption that markets will move from pools to cash is likely to prove correct
3994556 farmers have simply too much capital tied up in the cost of fertiliser chemicals diesel and labour to sustain an investment in a grain pool
3994557 we do not see fixed assets such as ports and storage as essential to be competitive

3994609 there are arrangements through the organisation austrac to follow money trails once you know what the money is being used for
3994610 i dont think we need legislation we just need authorities to pay attention and in particular we need the public to help the police identify theft at the time when its actually taking place
3994611 they feel they just need to take a course for the sake of a course we would utter a word of caution just try not to make hasty decisions
3994612 the president should emphasize that a normative prohibition on targeting non combatants and increased cooperation with other states in the international system are the goals of us counterterrorism strategy

3994622 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
3994623 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
3994624 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
3994625 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
3994626 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
3994627 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
3994628 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
3994629 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
3994630 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
3994631 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
3994632 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
3994633 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
3994634 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
3994635 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
3994636 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
3994637 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
3994638 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
3994639 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
3994640 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
3994641 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
3994642 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
3994643 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
3994644 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
3994645 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
3994646 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
3994647 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
3994648 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
3994649 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
3994650 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
3994651 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
3994652 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
3994653 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make

3994676 there is an agreement dating back to 1994 on the football mens olympic tournament this agreement ensures a qualitative strong football tournament with three players above 23 the ioc is unaware of any official request by fifa to change this agreement

3994680 an inquiry has been instituted to look into the issue immediately retired chief election commissioner t s krishnamurthy will go into all aspects of this matter to bring out the truth and submit report to the government at the earliest
3994681 i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting
3994682 the referees have to be in unison but there was a lot of doubt about a lot of the shots out there
3994683 i am glad it wasnt for a gold medal because that is all that this games would have been remembered for unfortunately
3994684 id hate to think that but you get the feeling out there when someone clearly misses all the shooters out there can tell if he missed or hit it
3994685 the crowd were yelling and calling shots in and out it was like a circus it would have been a brave chinese judge that would have put his hand up to signify a miss
3994686 my real age is 16 i dont care what other people say it is none of my business

3994690 i have played a few times against sa and even lost a singles against him at wimbledon some years ago i have never won against him but i didnt want to think about it i had expected that tomas berdych and radek stepanek would come through but they got beaten that shows anything can happen here

3994736 to see such a significant drop in june when people are typically on vacation speaks volumes as to how high gasoline prices are affecting many americans across the country

3994738 the level of excess capacity has shrunk down in the last few years to a level barely within the planning toleration of the industry
3994739 were to the point where we need every possible resource renewables demand response and energy efficiency nuclear clean coal you name it we need it
3994740 and we especially need the transmission lines that will bring the power generated by these new resources to consumers
3994741 if you dont have generation and transmission something has to give
3994742 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
3994743 i think there are too many negatives and the negatives are too large for a gasoline price decline to change the story significantly
3994744 no one is going to buy a car company like this in the market that its in
3994745 one could argue is it worth as much as they paid for it initially based on todays market

3994751 i put in charge of jerusalem my brother hanani along with hananiah the commander of the citadel because he was a man of integrity and feared god more than most men do
3994752 obviously the fight is predicated on sergio beating forrest again on sept 13 but i think we would have our deal firmly in place next week weve agreed on the initial figures for the fight the rest of the deal will be whatever oscar and golden boy promotions ceo richard schaefer think is fair the upside on the pay per view etc i trust them to be fair with me as they have been in the past but theres a minimum dollar figure that ive agreed on and so has sergio
3994753 the main goal for a fighter is to be respected and admired for what hes done
3994754 i got that in some ways with the contender it definitely changed my life winning a world championship was the next step and let me know i really was a good fighter now that im a world champion the next goal is to make money in order to make money you have to fight the biggest names the biggest name is oscar de la hoya and people will expect me to lose which i like but i know i can win
3994755 im taking this fight if i dont take this fight ill start my own web site and cuss myself out
3994756 i know vernon will be better prepared and in better shape than he was for our first fight
3994757 so i dont want to think too much about a de la hoya fight
3994758 i know that the talk about me fighting de la hoya will put an even hotter fire under vernons expletive to beat me but i will not overlook him i promise you that
3994759 ive been talking to richard for weeks and saying that if the pacquiao fight couldnt be made that i would love for oscar to fight sergio
3994760 we have a strong relationship between golden boy and tournament of contenders weve done several fights together
3994761 its been a great relationship with oscar and richard and their whole team
3994762 ive always felt from day 1 that oscars coming of age was when he beat julio cesar chavez
3994763 and oscars initial fame came from exposure on prime network television in the 1992 olympics sergio mora is the only other guy out there like that right now he spent 16 weeks on prime time on nbc on the contender he has a following

3994771 participating government shall maintain contact and consult through regular channels on matters connected with the implementation of the guidelines taking into account relevant international commitments and bilateral agreements with india
3994772 this is a much weaker formulation than the already weak march 2006 us draft proposal
3994773 participating governments may transfer trigger list items and or related technology to the safeguarded civil nuclear facilities in india as long as the participating government intending to make the transfer is satisfied that india continues to fully meet all of the aforementioned non proliferation and safeguards commitments and all other requirements of the nsg guidelines
3994774 participation of india in the decisions regarding proposed amendments will facilitate their implementation by india
3994775 a non proliferation disaster that could effectively end the nsg as a meaningful entity
3994776 the current us proposal should be flatly rejected by other nsg member states as unsound and irresponsible
3994777 shes been such a good dog i knew that if she was there she was doing her best to take care of jake
3994778 at least we know its over now wed been looking for my husband for six weeks and this isnt how we wanted it to end at least we can close this
3994779 it was a relief to know that theres an end and that we still have a part of jake
3994780 at times it may seem that we are not doing well in the sub continent but if you see our performances we have done well you could say we have lost a few crucial games we lost the tri series final in bangladesh and the asia cup finals but overall we have done consistently well in the sub continent
3994781 physically i was always ready it was never an injury issue or any fitness aspect i wasnt giving 100 per cent during the practice sessions which would have sent the wrong message if i had continued for some more time i would have got injured i think i am physically more conditioned now the break was important for me
3994782 hopefully everybody will get a chance in the five match one day series
3994783 badrinath and kohli are talented cricketers and have done well in the domestic circuit and in the india a tours they have been consistent and thus have been rewarded hopefully they will get a chance they are in a positive frame of mind
3994784 personally i feel sri lanka is one of the toughest venues to keep wickets last time when i came here i did not have a great time with the gloves i wont really blame dinesh and parthiv

3994787 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3994788 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3994789 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3994790 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3994791 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3994792 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3994793 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3994794 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3994795 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3994796 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3994797 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3994798 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3994799 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3994800 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3994801 once we step out on the field with texas the only ones who can help us is ourselves texas always has a very polished team that has great talent but they arent tough they arent a physically tough team
3994802 my defense will get to a point where they will be mean nasty and ornery bastards and thats what you need for texas texas will move the ball with tit for tat screens and options but well make them pay a price whenever they catch one of those dinky passes well put three hats on them and make them not want to get up thats the way to beat texas
3994803 the whole lineup changes the whole mentality just goes in the trash
3994804 i think maybe the referee rushed the decision to show michael the red card
3994805 i cant turn back i just got to keep going forward
3994806 it was difficult with the way they attacked us so hard wynne said
3994807 down a man and defending the whole time it was hard to get anything going offensively
3994808 the whole lineup changes the whole mentality just goes in the trash
3994809 i think maybe the referee rushed the decision to show michael the red card
3994810 i cant turn back i just got to keep going forward

3994815 these things have a way of nagging well let him get treatment and hopefully its quicker rather than not
3994816 doesnt really bother me ive played there all my life
3994817 youll always miss mike lowell every player is valuable on this team but its going to be tough not having your everyday third baseman in the lineup hes going to be here supporting the team and we have sean casey to step in not a bad hitter to have

3994823 die deutsche regierung unter f hrung von angela merkel ist dringend gefordert eine einheitliche linie zu finden abwarten hilft nicht die regierung erscheint in teilen befangen vorsicht nicht dass man nachher noch sagen kann sie sei gefangen in kameraderie dabei versucht russland die sowjetunion wieder zu errichten

3994828 the deceaseds wife later told us that mounting debts must have driven her husband to suicide we are however probing other angles too
3994829 earlier too he had tried to commit suicide but then timely intervention prevented anything untoward from happening this time there was nobody to stop him
3994830 the suicide note that has been left behind by mohanty is dated july 8 however he had spoken on telephone to one of his friends vinay mahajan on july 10 and had planned for a dinner on monday evening the suicide note and the telephone conversation prove that mohanty had been thinking about this extreme step for some days
3994831 but when vinay called him on monday he did not pick up his phone on tuesday morning vinay called up his institute and learnt that mohanty had not turned up to work this made him suspicious when there was no response at his home mohanty took the help of a neighbour and opened his door with a duplicate key they found mohanty hanging by a nylon rope in his bedroom

3994838 ontario and quebec residents are the worst hit canadians with 70 percent of the premature deaths occurring in central canada even though these two provinces comprise only 62 percent of canadas population

3994840 this tool represents a clear methodology shift the demise of the block level analog layout engineer why first as i said earlier the layout automation piece is very intuitive and friendly plus the smaller technology geometries that analog design is pushing into less than 90nm is forcing simulation earlier using cadence to account for device parasitics lod so the analog engineer is already doing a fair amount of the placement and letting the layout guy clean up the work but this tool is correct by construction and so the layout is clean from the get go so involving a layout person to clean it up isnt necessary
3994841 utilizing the high ft of sub micron cmos has opened a new paradigm in circuit design and to reduce the product cycle time there is a need to understand the parasitics early in development process analog rails has taken a critical step in this direction
3994842 what analog rails is developing is a tool that will enable circuit designers to extend their deliverable from annotated schematics to finished and polished layout without outside layout or cad involvement furthermore having a tight coupling of schematics and layout design will result in better design practices with fewer extraction iterations

3994849 work choices is a thing of australias past not its future
3994850 we have already ended the making of australian workplace agreements because they did so much harm to australian working families
3994851 the workplace ombudsman will certainly respond if a complaint is made
3994852 the leaked documents show the company is determined to defy the rudd government on its industrial relations policy
3994853 the documents show telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer

3994859 all australians will enjoy the cultural benefits which will flow from the projects that receive these funds the dance festivals music television and radio productions the arts and crafts and the revival and strengthening of our indigenous languages

3994861 obviously in terms of value of money i want to look at the whole lecturing profile i want to make sure that the senior people in our universities who are the most professional who have the greatest experience and who can make a valuable contribution to students are actually in the classroom from time to time
3994862 they the colleges and universities are saying that they do not have adequate funds but i am looking at exactly what funds we have put into the third level sector
3994863 we have already increased funding by 25pc in three years that is an outstanding achievement but people have been critical of the hse and the amount of funding that has been put into the hse and have questioned exactly what has been attained from that funding
3994864 i as minister want to carry out an audit on the third level sector and i am going to have a look at a number of the institutions and to see how they are performing how the money is targeted and if we are getting the benefits from it
3994865 i also want to see that money is targeted towards students student services and social inclusion
3994866 people have got to understand what we are at here i want a national debate on the entire third level sector this sector is the fulcrum for the future growth of our economy for the production of jobs and innovation
3994867 any investment outside china needs regulatory approval from the state the addition of ireland will increase the awarness of of investment opportunities here for chinese investors the irish market is in the final stages of concluding its qdii status via the financial regulator

3994869 non performing loans is the key to future credit charges
3994870 the irish residential development sector has continued to deteriorate due to more restricted mortgage availability particularly in the last quarter
3994871 we continue to take a low conviction stance on the sector
3994872 overall we are cautious in the short term but remain positive on a longer term horizon
3994873 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them

3994880 brit and lee spent so much time together that one thing led to another and their relationship became physical
3994881 who wouldnt be flattered that a celebrity is interested in them
3994882 they dont judge criticise or compete they nurture even famous men like to be nutured
3994883 to be married to another famous person was a huge pressure one i didnt enjoy

3994892 sir are we going to have an incident do we need to call security for suspicion of terrorism just pay the extra fee or i cant let you take the extra baggage
3994893 i guess i have to pay the fee it is like you have us at gunpoint
3994894 es ist zu fr h um von einem befreiungsschlag zu sprechen aber wir haben uns gute chancen auf das viertelfinale erhalten und das ist ein gutes gef hl
3994895 die mannschaft ist mehr als intakt wir k mpfen uns durch
3994896 im spielverlauf war es nicht gut f rs selbstvertrauen im nachhinein ja
3994897 wir waren abgekl rter und diszipliniert und haben ein vern nftiges spiel abgeliefert ich hoffe dass wir auf dem weg weitermachen
3994898 i have never imagined that i could win the gold in the olympic games
3994899 my first thought after i touched the wall was wow ive won an olympic final
3994900 its a new generation and now its time to step aside
3994901 the best moment is when i turned back and i saw the number one next to my name
3994902 its huge unbelievable at any moment i felt that i could be beaten
3994903 i think medals mean more than times so thats what im going to be focusing on over the next three days
3994904 i cant believe it i know i was feeling down after the relay but i didnt want to get beaten
3994905 today it was not about the silver medal or the world record it was about touching the wall
3994906 im very happy i performed so well in my first olympic final unfortunately it was not good enough for the day
3994907 this town would turn upside down i couldnt even begin to fathom this city if that would happen i couldnt i couldnt even tell you how unbelievably rocking this city would be if thats what it came down to
3994908 you know what it would be like you know what it would be like like varsity blues that movie where the town shuts down thats exactly what it would be every bar every sports bar every pub would be absolutely packed you couldnt move
3994909 with the help of god watch out for my return
3994910 di ko lang kayo miss love ko kayong lahat i not only miss you but i love all of you too
3994911 i think we should give it to our soldiers to die with dignity
3994912 we would like to remember our soldiers for their heroism not their suffering
3994913 once upon a time i was a soldier and i wouldnt want it to happen to me or to anyone
3994914 we would just like to appeal for sensitivity because at times even if the nature of our jobs dictate we have to temper it in order to guard some sensitivities or some feelings that may be hurt
3994915 i think the position of the afp here is for the members of the media to police their own ranks maybe to guard each others coverage maybe to caution each other if one is going out of bounds
3994916 i think that is not up for me to say maybe the members of the media can talk among themselves
3994917 when i gave her vidal the copy there was no rollo involved and no official receipt meaning it was unofficial
3994918 she being a nice lady you cannot refuse her but you told her to sign it
3994919 i only gave her vidal an hour or two to read the decision and i had to get it back immediately
3994920 looking worried and asked if i signed it the document
3994921 he looked relaxed when i told him that i had signed it which made me believe that it was the final decision now i know he is weaving a set of lies
3994922 the officer was using the baton as he was taught to
3994923 but we very much keep in mind what recordings cant do they only show part of the story
3994924 one of the most aggressive police departments in the country
3994925 its hard to believe that these incidents arent happening a great deal more than the ones actually ending up on video
3994926 using force is ugly but if you dont do that youll have a violent felon running around
3994927 we do things people in an office or store or hospital dont have to do
3994928 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
3994929 hey im going to be shoving stubs in this block kthxbai
3994930 i have someone who needs me who wants me i am beautiful i am wanted i am worthy i am no longer alone
3994931 after all the effort that we put in to get somebody a fair trial and then to say no matter what we did it didnt matter i dont see that as a positive step
3994932 spray and pray charge everybody lets go speed speed speed
3994933 the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
3994934 to show to russia that we can come to the aid of a european ally and that we can do it at will whenever and wherever we want
3994935 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3994936 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3994937 we were unhappy with the initial actions of the american officials but this one was very strong
3994938 we wont be protecting the airport or seaport but well certainly protect our assets if we need to
3994939 to continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
3994940 it brought me comfort and i thought about it a lot
3994941 he was the master of the word and wisdom the symbol who expressed our national feeling our human constitution our declaration of independence
3994942 russians should see that this is not a demoralized you know nervous panicking capital that is just scared
3994943 shops are open there are no lines for gas stations prices are not up
3994944 we will fight to the end until the last russian soldier leaves georgian soil and this country is not going to be brought to the knees anymore we are not surrendering no matter what
3994945 we already saw the u s air force landing in georgia despite russians controlling the airspace
3994946 and we will see u s military ships entering georgian ports despite russians blocking it that we will see
3994947 what do i need a country that kills its citizens for
3994948 now the situation is that the people are strongly supporting the government the solidarity in georgian society is quite high
3994949 he has always tried to put a good face on what has happened
3994950 but yesterday when i saw him he looked frightened like he was waiting for france to come in and solve his problems
3994951 they were ambushed and murdered at 10 30 in the morning by numerous armed gunmen and it was very very fast
3994952 they were absolutely committed passionate caring and highly effective workers and they were purely on a humanitarian mission
3994953 i walked over and found a disaster bodies on the ground some mangled some wounded it was awful
3994954 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3994955 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3994956 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3994957 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3994958 you know one day everyones going to finally get tired of hire a cops and itll be them put u
3994959 ice 9 was the death of the world by freezing
3994960 never mind kip an exercise for one and all look at the image look this is the man really driving
3994961 thats not a terrorist looks more like a starling to me
3994962 he said i told the nursing department im in pain but they dont believe me
3994963 you know one day everyones going to finally get tired of hire a cops and itll be them put u
3994964 ice 9 was the death of the world by freezing
3994965 never mind kip an exercise for one and all look at the image look this is the man really driving
3994966 thats not a terrorist looks more like a starling to me
3994967 there are other people here others like me but they arent as civilized as me so leave before the others wake up
3994968 how could so many many smart people elected to lead our nation take us down the forsaken path which has led to so much unnecessary suffering and misdirected energy in our classrooms with high stakes testing
3994969 nearly half of the states showed little or no improvement despite huge increases in funding and instructional time
3994970 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
3994971 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
3994972 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
3994973 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
3994974 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
3994975 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
3994976 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
3994977 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
3994978 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
3994979 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
3994980 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
3994981 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
3994982 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
3994983 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
3994984 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
3994985 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
3994986 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
3994987 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
3994988 but it came with a note that said win one for the little guy will you here he is sending that to a super late model guy when everyone thinks he hates them
3994989 the mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell and a hell of heaven
3994990 take what you learn and make a difference with it

3995166 i was going to set the record if id had the race at about 11 00 i was so calm i think i could have seen each face in this venue
3995167 we spent two weeks training together in japan and thats one of the big reasons for my improvement i became a more patient and focused swimmer
3995168 four years ago was a disappointment that will stay with me for a long time but at the same time it makes it all worthwhile when you can come back four years later and get the silver medal
3995169 for a player its not the greatest feeling sitting in the stands watching the team play in a must win game

3995184 i dont think it would be too much of a leap to say that you have the same sorts of problems with violence in pregnancy in australia
3995185 three quarters of the women who experienced violence during the pregnancy had also experienced violence from the partner prior to the pregnancy as well
3995186 it could be that if you are in a violent situation you are less likely to be sure that you want to have a baby
3995187 asian women report rates of abortion that are about three times the rate for pakeha people of european descent that is a consistent finding it confirms other studies

3995224 in a classic business strategy of divide and conquer the documents show telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3995225 workers that do not accept the companys offer could be punished by a 12 month wages freeze
3995226 this plan by telstra human resources to deceive and trick workers has been in operation since february the documents show that telstras human resources managers have had no intention of genuinely consulting with staff or taking into account their concerns over pay and conditions
3995227 telstra management has already determined what it will offer staff when their current enterprise agreement expires next month
3995228 it is clear proof that telstra management never intended to follow through with discussions it started in may with unions over a new collective agreement for its workers
3995229 it also shows telstra management misled its 32 000 staff and the australian public about the reasons it broke off talks with unions in july
3995230 telstra management has no respect for the rights of its workers to be represented by their union
3995231 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour under our current ir laws
3995232 oh we were just kidding that was like satire you libruls just cant take a joke
3995233 i also noticed something when i was reading thru your blogs many times you say god bless you all and even in jordans blog you ask god to bless her but in your profile you say you are an agnostic how can you blindly follow something you dont even know if you believe in but yet you wait until you can handle the outcome of a fictional character that you believe in fantasy to exsist in a realm past our own would the real ashley please stand up you know they say if you dont stand for something you will fall for anything

3995265 conditions within rural and regional australia remain generally better than 12 months ago and agricultural markets remain strong
3995266 our assumption that markets will move from pools to cash is likely to prove correct
3995267 farmers have simply too much capital tied up in the cost of fertiliser chemicals diesel and labour to sustain an investment in a grain pool
3995268 we do not see fixed assets such as ports and storage as essential to be competitive
3995269 unless the assailed decision is enjoined there is a great likelihood of said petition being rendered moot and academic by mere passage of time without actually being heard and decided on the merits a decidedly unjust situation for the petitioner who in the event of a favorable decision in the instant petition would find the same ineffectual

3995291 you and your family and your ancestors have been the keepers of this sacred tomb for all these years and it isnt fitting that i should ignore that
3995292 its a careful choice of the right materials and the right structuring to get this effect for the first time at these wavelengths

3995295 these metamaterials have opened a new chapter in electromagnetism weve opened the door into the secret garden
3995296 this cloak guides electromagnetic waves around a central region so that any object at all can be placed in that region and will not disturb the electromagnetic fields
3995297 there is reduced reflection from the object and there is also reduced shadow
3995298 as an application its not clear that youre going to get the invisibility that everyone thinks about as in harry potters cloak or the star trek cloaking device
3995299 theres a rule about the internal structure of the metamaterial it has to be smaller than the wavelength of radiation so for radar waves thats 3cm you can easily engineer something a few millimeters across
3995300 you go up to optical radiation visible light and the wavelength is less than a micron so your microstructure has to be a few tens of nanometers across and were only just learning how to do nanotechnology maybe in five or 10 years time you could do this but not today
3995301 you mustnt demand that the cloak be too thin despite the hype around harry potter this isnt anything that flaps around in the breeze its more like a shed

3995372 i didnt feel pressure before the competition i tried to relax
3995373 in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about the others
3995374 we swam together and i felt like we were in training
3995375 the best moment is when i turned back and i saw the number one next to my name
3995376 its huge unbelievable at any moment i felt that i could be beaten
3995377 i was going ok until the last 50 metres and then i ran low on energy but it was a good swim and i am pleased with the time

3995379 einige der auftr ge von denen wir erwartet hatten dass sie im laufe des quartals abgeschlossen werden sind aufgrund fehlender essentieller hardware komponenten in das dritte quartal gerutscht wir haben jedoch einen rekord gesamtauftragsbestand von ber 30 mio us dollar f r mam und grafikprodukte aufgebaut daher sind wir weiterhin zuversichtlich die zum jahresanfang genannte prognose zu erf llen
3995380 mit blick auf mam bersteigt die nachfrage unsere aktuellen lieferkapazit ten wir unternehmen schritte zur erweiterung des personals um von dieser starken nachfrage zu profitieren die anforderungen unserer kunden in diesem sektor sind f r uns noch h ufig eine herausforderung und sehr arbeitsintensiv aber wir erzielen gute fortschritte beim verbessern unserer internen betrieblichen abl ufe und steigern dadurch unsere effizienz ltere komplexe und ressourcen stark beanspruchende projekte befinden sich kurz vor dem abschluss womit sich spielr ume f r die annahme und bearbeitung rentablerer projekte erschlie en
3995381 im bereich der grafiksoftware gibt es obwohl wir das vorgegebene ziel einer wachstumsrate von 20 im quartal bisher nicht erreicht haben keine sichtbaren zeichen f r eine verlangsamung des gesch fts unsere prognose bezog sich auf das gesamte gesch ftsjahr und der existierende auftragsbestand rechtfertigt die annahme dass wir dieses ziel erreichen werden
3995382 die escenic transaktion ist nun abgeschlossen und wir werden sofort mit dem sondieren des vollst ndigen potenzials eines zusammengef hrten angebots beginnen start ist auf der messe ibc mitte september hier werden wir die erste generation integrierter produkte vorstellen die tatsache dass sich einige mediengruppen mit sinkenden werbeeinahmen konfrontiert sehen wird h chstwahrscheinlich den bedarf an intelligenten investitionen verst rken der einsatz von workflow l sungen die einen mehrfachen bearbeitungsaufwand vermeiden wird ein kritischer faktor bei der kontrolle der kosten sein unsere vereinten und kombinierten produkte welche werkzeuge f r grafiken liefern traditionelles vizrt f r content management ardendo und publishing escenic bieten hierf r ein perfektes angebot
3995383 some of the orders we expected to complete this quarter have slipped into q3 due to lack of supply of essential hardware components however we have built up a record backlog of over usd 30 million for mam and graphics combined and we are confident we should be able to achieve what we provided as our outlook at the beginning of the year
3995384 looking at mam demand is exceeding our current capacity to supply we are taking steps to increase staff in order to benefit from the strong demand mam requests from customers are still challenging and labor intensive but we are making good progress in improving our internal operational work flow and thereby increasing efficiency older complex and resource intensive projects are about to be completed which leaves room for more lucrative deals to be finalized and pursued
3995385 on the graphics side there are no visible signs of a slowdown even if so far we have not reached the projected 20 growth quarter on quarter
3995386 the escenic deal has now been completed and we will immediately start exploring the full potential of the combined businesses beginning at ibc mid september where we will present the first generation of integrated products the fact that some media houses see a decrease in advertising revenues will most likely trigger the making of smarter investments in workflow solutions that avoid a duplication of efforts which will be crucial to control costs our combined and integrated products delivering tools for graphics traditional vizrt content management ardendo and publishing escenic are therefore a perfect match

3995409 knowing where customers are also helps us to assist them in the event of disasters such as summer floods
3995410 we can establish the scale of the response and work to help our customers as quickly as possible
3995411 the way the geographical data is presented and the platforms it is going to connect with must be taken into consideration
3995412 companies may want to use the data for other software in areas such as customer services and renewals so integration must be carried out with caution as completely standalone outputs could create issues such as having to do manual lists and manage duplication
3995413 when companies are managing risk of crime related to a property location wrong use of data could have an adverse effect such as affecting house prices

3995417 i think the bursting is a function of sensory deprivation
3995418 with no structured sensory input the hypothesis is that you get arbitrarily random and quite often detrimental activity because all these cells are asking for some kind of direction

3995424 i dont think it would be too much of a leap to say that you have the same sorts of problems with violence in pregnancy in australia
3995425 three quarters of the women who experienced violence during the pregnancy had also experienced violence from the partner prior to the pregnancy as well
3995426 it could be that if you are in a violent situation you are less likely to be sure that you want to have a baby
3995427 asian women report rates of abortion that are about three times the rate for pakeha people of european descent that is a consistent finding it confirms other studies
3995428 it may be anything from different cultural perceptions about abortion it may be about differential knowledge about contraception or about different access to contraception there is a whole range of things
3995429 i dont think it would be too much of a leap to say that you have the same sorts of problems with violence in pregnancy in australia
3995430 after reading your blog and the comments others have left on your blog i have to admit that most men are exactly as you describe them it almost makes me ashamed to be a man the men you describe totally disgust me i hope you dont think that were all like that im certainly not like that

3995453 you let everyone walk all over you and you dont do a thing about it
3995454 when are you going to quit letting everyone take advantage of you
3995455 this has got to stop now ive had it im done i just cant take anymore what the hell am i doing
3995456 its really good to practice against somebody else you see different defenses they see different offenses just different things going on i think you get almost a better look at your young players because its not against the same old guys everyday so we are really enjoying it
3995457 it starts at the top the discipline is instilled and we are professionals i cant figure that one out or understand that i think thats kind of ridiculous honestly but we are all professionals and we are just out here trying to get better its about a common respect for the men across from you were at war and its football but at the end of the day we are playing a game
3995458 there is a lot of respect coaches that know each other a lot of the players know each other i think our work habits are the same how we practice with shoulder pads on or without the pads i think thats all under control we got a lot of respect and we just work good and we are trying to get better
3995459 new orleans and houston have so much in common and so many people in houston go to new orleans to do business and people in new orleans come to houston on a regular basis
3995460 so it is an opportunity to develop a rivalry that i think can be meaningful over time i hope that well play in preseason every year
3995461 i remember it well what it came down to was as a team if you improve your offense by having bush are you a stronger team if you just put him out on the team do you have a better chance of winning with him on the houston texans or by improving your defense by taking mario williams our coaches felt that we had a better chance to win by improving our defense and that even if we had a bush our offense would not be better than say indianapolis so the way for us to win in our division was to strengthen our defense and that was the decision that was made
3995462 how often do you see a physical specimen like mario williams hes 6 6 6 7 290 pounds he can run and jump like a running back
3995463 no i dont because when i look back on it not just myself i get other guys to critique me there was a lot of things that were left on the field that could have been better and that could have helped me out and could have helped the team out you know there is always room for improvement
3995464 i realized that what i did before wasnt good enough i see it like that and i want my teammates to see it the same way we all push each other
3995465 when i looked at last year after i critiqued myself and had my coaches critique myself there was a lot of things where i was like that could have been another one that could have been another one and thats how youve got have to see it you are only dissatisfied whenever you look at the film and you know that you didnt miss any of them and that number could be tremendous thats the thing about football the guys throughout the season they dont get them all but if you can get them all or try to get as many as you can the number can be outstanding

3995471 dit leeft nu vooral bij kleinere en middelgrote ondernemingen maar ook grotere ondernemingen beginnen de voordelen van hosted security te ontdekken
3995472 security vergt voor de meeste bedrijven gewoon te veel deskundigheid we gaan naar deskundigen voor onze gezondheid omdat het teveel tijd vergt om het zelf te leren bovendien zijn we niet altijd ziek zo moet je hosted security ook zien
3995473 maar als je plastic bekers vervaardigt is een virus in je bedrijfsnetwerk pijnlijk te noemen voor zulke ondernemingen wordt security een onderscheidende factor en dan kan uitbesteden de beste optie zijn
3995474 als jij je e mail laat scannen door een derderangs bedrijfje dan is er natuurlijk grote kans dat die club niet veel redundantie heeft ook kan de gebruikte apparatuur niet modern genoeg zijn wat prestatieproblemen kan opleveren

3995476 je bent af van toekomstige investeringen in hardware software en manuren veel hosted security providers bieden continu de nieuwste updates en technologische vernieuwingen zonder dat je daar extra voor hoeft te betalen
3995477 daarnaast werkt hosted security vaak op afstand en houdt het malware dus ver weg van het bedrijfsnetwerk dat is een ontlasting van je infrastructuur
3995478 verder is het een voordeel dat de aanbieder is gespecialiseerd in security die ziet nieuwe virussen en vormen van spam eerder aankomen en kan ze beter bestrijden

3995494 you see every person smells different has a different essence if you locked an alcoholic in a room full of stale beer hed gladly drink it but he could resist if he wished to if he were a recovering alcoholic now lets say you placed in that room a glass of hundred year old brandy the rarest finest cognac and filled the room with its warm aroma how do you think he would fare then
3995495 maybe that not the right comparison maybe it would be too easy to turn down the brandy perhaps i should have made our alcoholic a heroin addict instead

3995509 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3995510 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3995511 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3995512 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
3995513 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3995514 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3995515 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3995516 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
3995517 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field

3995534 russia has jeopardized its relationship with the west by invading a sovereign state and such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3995535 direct dialogue with the leaders of states around which certain problems accumulate is always more productive and is the shortest path to success than a policy of threats sanctions and a resolution to use force
3995536 is your governments objective regime change in the democratically elected government of georgia
3995537 regime change is an american expression we do not use such an expression but sometimes there are occasions that there are different leaders who come to power either democratically or semi democratically and they become an obstacle
3995538 they of course had to hang saddam hussein but the current georgian ruler who in one hour simply wiped 10 ossetian villages from the face of the earth who used tanks to run over children and the elderly who threw civilians into cellars and burnt them this georgian leader is a player that has to be protected by the west

3995541 we were tortured by officials in nasaka and the officials also urged us to oppress the local people we do not want to oppress people so we deserted from nasaka
3995542 we are preparing to seek safety as refugees with unhcr if we have the chance because we are worried about our security here
3995543 the monthly salary is only 21 000 kyat for a nasaka man but in maungdaw the price of ordinary rice is 25 000 kyat a 50 kilogram sack all private nasaka men are facing hunger due to their salary being inadequate for their daily survival
3995544 hunger is also another reason for us to desert from the law enforcement of nasaka

3995562 if current trends continue we are likely to see the pass rate nudge over 97 per cent this year
3995563 in terms of a grades in 2002 it was 20 7 per cent and in 2007 it was 25 3 per cent
3995564 that means its risen by just short of 5 per cent in six years should that continue it will mean more than 26 per cent will get a grades this year
3995565 if you look at the trends there has been a big change in subjects over time if you take the ten years through to 2007 the big growth areas have been in media studies sports studies psychology and religious studies
3995566 but other subjects have been falling in popularity sharply like economics and french and german although there has been an increase in spanish
3995567 i think probably the fall in french and german is likely to continue because the numbers taking languages at gcse have been falling
3995568 there could be a number of reasons why spanish is becoming more popular spain is a popular holiday destination david beckham and other footballers have increased the interest and more people are aware that spanish is one of the four major languages of the world

3995583 the forum is not about conversion per se as the bar council endorses the absolute right of individuals to embrace islam instead the forum will address the ancillary issues that arise from such situations and will emphasise the need for laws and a judicial system that protects everyone equally
3995584 when i realised that other muslims would be attending the forum including pas and other islamic ngos i joined in however my attendance was to ensure that pas supporters did not become unruly and cause any problems
3995585 fy08 was a year of strong financial performance for the asx group and a very demanding one for asxs supervisory operational and risk management functions profit growth slowed during the second half of fy08 compared to the first half in keeping with volatile financial markets globally and initial listing activity reduced sharply consistent with tighter domestic credit conditions and lower business confidence a trend mirrored in other developed financial economy exchange markets trade execution volumes in the cash equities market continued to grow at a staggering pace post merger cost savings in equipment occupancy and administration expenses also contributed to the strong financial result importantly record fee rebates were paid to market participants the performance of asx during the difficult market conditions of fy08 underlines the resilience and diversity of the groups business model and the enormous market efficiency it delivers to the australian capital market everyday that performance is also a credit to the professionalism and competence of asxs workforce two years on from the creation of the integrated australian securities exchange revenues have risen and operating costs have reduced from what they were at the time of the asx sfe merger despite additional investment in supervisory resources asxs commitment to market supervision continued to match market conditions with full time equivalent staff numbers for asx markets supervision rising from 84 in fy07 to 103 in fy08 asx also completed the integration of the operational and technology environments of both exchanges during the second half of fy08 with no material disruption to user service levels the availability and performance of asxs core applications across the company announcements trade execution risk management and clearing and settlement systems continue to achieve global best practice levels although global equity and credit markets continue to be more fragile and volatile than in recent years i remain cautiously optimistic about the prospects for asx over the medium term
3995586 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings
3995587 its like an egg toss if you move your hand backward as you catch the egg and increase the time of contact over which the impact occurs the impact will be less forceful and the egg will not break it is the same phenomenon experienced in catching a baseball
3995588 our studies with carbon nanotubes have been ongoing for quite some time each step along the way has led to the next breakthrough and each time weve learned more about how they grow and what their applications could be we believe that carbon nanotubes have tremendous potential for the lives of each one of us

3995631 we are not going to shoot we are not going to kill
3995632 we came here simply to restore order and now it is secure here see i can drive around unarmed
3995633 the russians came first then the ossetians who shot at anyone they saw
3995634 the ossetians walk into homes take any valuables they want and then burn the rest
3995635 the russians are looting everything in sight the whole city is full of marauders
3995636 who in the world is going to help us nobody cares
3995637 there were only two or three cars of ossetians that came down i personally confiscated their assault rifles kicked them in their behinds and told them that i will have them executed if they come again

3995646 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3995647 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3995648 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3995649 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3995650 he is not from another planet he is from the future

3995652 the whitebait spawn where grasses clump together and form a dense root mat where there is almost 100 percent humidity its not uncommon for different generations of fish to choose the same clump of grass for egg laying
3995653 the west coast famous for whitebait has seen massive dairying conversions in the last few years too frequently this has been to the detriment of the local environment as some farmers choose to put profit ahead of all else
3995654 the whitebait tradition is dear to most new zealanders as is the delicious whitebait fritter but this tradition is increasingly more difficult to secure as we experienced during last years meagre season

3995666 its demoralising to see that the teachers scarcity allowance which the government has been working on hasnt come through
3995667 given the dire difficulties in attracting recruiting and retaining good teachers in the system its absolutely necessary that teachers be compensated adequately for the work they do in educating our children
3995668 teaching is a full time job in the sense that theres hardly a difference between the public and private life of a teacher
3995669 we took up the case as soon as the new government was formed and the government has asked the ministry to work out a package of incentives and compensation for teachers

3995691 i use the bottle and just refill it from the tap

3995701 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3995702 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3995703 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3995704 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3995705 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3995707 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3995708 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3995709 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3995710 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3995711 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3995712 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3995713 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3995714 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3995715 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3995716 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

3995718 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3995719 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3995720 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3995721 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3995722 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3995723 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3995724 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
3995725 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

3995727 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
3995728 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3995729 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3995730 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3995731 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3995732 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3995733 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3995734 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3995735 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3995736 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3995737 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3995738 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3995739 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

3995750 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3995751 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3995752 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial

3995754 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3995755 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3995756 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3995757 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3995758 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3995759 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3995760 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3995761 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3995762 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

3995768 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3995769 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3995770 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3995771 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3995772 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3995773 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3995774 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3995775 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3995776 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3995777 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3995778 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

3995784 the price of gasoline was reduced because of many factors and the most important factor is the decline of world crude oil prices
3995785 with the current world crude oil price so low and the newly adjusted domestic gasoline price the fuel trading companies are no longer losing money

3995790 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3995791 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3995792 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3995793 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3995794 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3995795 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3995796 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3995797 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3995798 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3995799 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3995800 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3995801 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3995803 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3995804 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3995805 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3995806 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3995807 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3995808 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3995809 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3995810 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3995811 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3995812 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3995813 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3995814 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3995815 i knew it was going to be a tough match
3995816 i made a lot of mistakes in the first set
3995817 when the second set began i decided i had to change up i started hitting a lot of heavy balls and lobs and i saw she didnt know what to do with those sometimes you have to win ugly
3995818 after i broke her to go up 2 1 and 4 1 she seemed to lose her confidence
3995819 i knew i still had to be at the top of my game and not give her any easy games what i liked about today was i was able to keep the pressure on to ensure my level of play and not give her any easy points
3995820 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3995821 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

3995832 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3995833 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3995834 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3995835 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3995836 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3995837 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3995838 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3995839 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3995840 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3995841 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3995842 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3995843 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3995844 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3995845 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3995846 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3995847 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

3995851 mccain has a good record on that issue abortion and he must show that he will continue it as president
3995852 for mccain the aim will be to solidify evangelicals as a key constituency
3995853 for obama it is significant that he will be participating as an equal on the same stage as mccain in an this signals the shift in the evangelical political landscape since 2004
3995854 this has a lot less to do with what is going on in california and more to do with what is going on in ohio pennsylvania and florida the

3995880 one million iraqis are dead five thousand americans are dead you have destroyed the first second fourth fifth and eighth amendments
3995881 i take an oath of office to uphold the constitution of the united states and dont tell me that i dont do that
3995882 why dont you go picket the republicans in congress that will not allow us to have a vote on the war this is not very effective not very effective
3995883 as speaker of the house the third highest office first is the president then vice president and then speaker i take my responsibilities deadly seriously
3995884 i try to promote bipartisanship but thats not what the other side wants
3995885 this election is like death for life on this planet as we know it today
3995886 it was a point guard to point guard matchup in the first half it was threes to threes
3995887 weve got kids that have played well for us off of the bench consistently all year
3995888 im basically getting 10 kids time thats been one of our strengths
3995889 but really basically what it came down to was that we lost concentration and when we lost concentration we didnt box out we had some bad mismatches and bad errors so really the lack of concentration is much needed in big games and unfortunately that didnt happen
3995890 i just think we needed to be a tougher team
3995891 i said dont get frustrated because they were scoring so much
3995892 i dont know we just kind of were relentless and they kind of missed a few shots and then we kind of kept going
3995893 there wasnt a doubt in my mind or a doubt in my players minds and i was really pleased that they left it all on the court
3995894 we beat an awfully good team tonight and im pretty proud of our effort
3995895 well i dont think that anybody thought that portland state would come out and have a year like this
3995896 people are going to know about us now nobodys going to walk into a gym expecting a win against us anymore we were one step closer this year and i think thatll definitely fuel the fire im excited to see what we can do in another six months
3995897 can i just say one thing i think that portland state should get a nit bid print that for me
3995898 im really excited to play them montana state theyre a great team and it was kind of hard to lose to them that was the first time that i had ever lost to the cats or that anyone in our program has so were really excited to play them
3995899 this game meant a lot to me you know i havent been to a championship game so all our players stepped up good today
3995900 my freshman year we went three and 24 i would say there was no intimidation factor playing portland state and thats definitely changed no one will ever walk into our place ever again and think they have the game in hand
3995901 with that recruiting class he montana coach wayne tinkle has taken care of a 1 a 3 and a 4
3995902 thats going to be the best class in the big sky
3995903 upaya pemanggilan ini untuk membungkam perbedaan pendapat ini juga tanda tanda otoriter mulai kembali kami ingatkan pimpinan polri untuk jangan kacang lupa kulit polisi bisa lepas dari tni berkat perjuangan para aktivis mahasiswa dan pemuda jenderal sutanto juga saya imbau seperti itu kembalikan fungsi polri yang sesungguhnya jangan dijadikan alat politik dan alat represif
3995904 pokoknya jangan lupa sejarah sebagai warga negara yang baik kami bersedia memenuhi panggilan polisi kami siap menghadapi risiko apapun
3995905 itu kelemahan kami kalau sudah unggul menjelang akhir suka agak kendur padahal ganda thailand ini tak bisa dilepas harus ditekan terus kalau tidak bisa berbahaya
3995906 selama kami terus mengontrol tak masalah cuma tadi kami terburu buru mau menyelesaikan pertandingan sehingga mereka bisa mengejar
3995907 dalam beberapa pertemuan terakhir kami menang namun kami tak boleh lengah serangan mereka bagus dan yu yang sangat berbahaya kalau kita bisa mematikan dia akan lebih mudah
3995908 the cynthia mckinney rosa clemente ticket is a stinging rejection and rebuke of the democratic and republican parties i
3995909 by supporting the candidacies of cynthia mckinney and rosa clemente we are supporting so much more than only candidates for political office we are supporting our commitment to the building of an uncompromising unswerving peoples movement that is unhindered by this systems republicratic party election time lines and political machine we are refusing to collaborate with this empires system of oppression rather we are working to dismantle it and build a fundamentally and systemically different system that addresses human needs not human greed
3995910 even the power to the people programs inclusion of the call for the creation of a new black led political party a reconstruction party which has touched some raw nerves among some green party loyalists who see the green party as the answer to the political crisis of our times did not meet with any overt opposition at this convention and in fact many green members and delegates are supportive of this idea and welcome the anticipated entrance of a reconstruction party into the political arena
3995911 the hearing consisted of the members of the platform committee sitting literally on a raised platform above the audience and going over their proposed platform to us section by section they would stop and allow limited time for delegates to come to the mic and give our feedback and input which they would then take under advisement and vote among themselves as to whether to accept or reject
3995912 the elected governments of palestine and israel must each declare the right of the other to exist
3995913 language that was amazing to find in platform proceedings of any party that considers itself progressive
3995914 guest worker programs are required when workers wish to work in the u s but do not want to be forced to give up their citizenship in their home countries workers who sincerely are not seeking a path to u s citizenship such programs must adequately protect the labor rights of these workers
3995915 on saturday morning after a procedural controversy concerning the right of various members of the latino caucus to speak on the platform speakers spoke to the question of the platform their lineup of speakers completely demolished the proposed 2008 platforms credibility
3995916 they were hoping to nominate cynthia under conditions that would allow them to control things and which would pressure her to compromise her power to the people platform for a more conservative platform of their own what happened was that she was nominated but their platform was defeated they now do not have a current platform for their party and have no chance of being able to create one until 2009 at the earliest
3995917 11 million members throughout the world five million in the united states polygamy officially renounced in 1890
3995918 a work that enlarges the soul of man broadens his views regarding the welfare of his fellowman and plants in his heart a love for all the children of our heavenly father there is no work equal to that in the temple for the dead in teaching a man to love his neighbor as himself
3995919 pastilah itu bisa kita penuhi tahun depan tetapi tunggu saja pidato presiden besok
3995920 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
3995921 political stability in my view can only be brought through a reconciliation approach as opposed to confrontation
3995922 the era of repression is over forever dictatorship has become a tale of the past
3995923 malaysiakini said it would reveal the identities of the commenters if it could however the cops raided and seized all their computers the only reason that may help in this case is to obtain correspondence between the commenter and rpk for example e mails as evidence for further investigation if not then the only thing rpk can give them is the internet protocol addresses and times which these addresses were logged onto his site the police can then cross reference this with the service provider for example tmnet to find out exactly which computer was logged on
3995924 this is akin to an invasion of privacy the complainant should point out specific comments for the court to decide if they are objectionable or would aid in an investigation
3995925 in any case reading an allegedly illegal article is not an offence
3995926 our lawyer recommended that the comment be removed but that the ip and time of comment be withheld unless they obtained a court order the company said it would do so but eventually we did not hear further
3995927 i have not seen anything more defamatory than what this man has written none of what he said is true
3995928 even someone with a pea sized brain would realise the preposterousness of the stories raja petra has posted on his blog
3995929 hello world heres my story read and leave comments if wish
3995930 this case is about an assault on a police officer
3995931 i know there are going to be some things that distract you in this case
3995932 the evidence is going to show that the defendant was arrested and while she was being led to a cruiser she bites a police officer and just before she was placed in the cruiser kicked him in the groin
3995933 at home in bed with her daughter at 1 in the morning
3995934 to trick her to gain entry into her home and when they couldnt intimidate her to hand the child over what they couldnt do by hook the did by crook
3995935 you will recall that for my entire political career here basically i was not the the endorsed candidate of any political organization here that i didnt go around wielding a bunch of clout that my reputation in springfield was as an independent and my reputation here was also as somebody who would to try to work with everybody there is no doubt i had friends and continue to have friends who come out of the more traditional school of chicago politics but thats not what launched my political career and thats not what ive ever depended on in order to get elected and i would challenge any chicago reporter to dispute that basic fact
3995936 but you once told emil jones that he could make you a united states senator and you exchanged endorsements with richard m daley whom your wife once worked for and your political career here was funded by tony rezko you also endorsed the organization candidate over the reformer every single time and never spoke out against the more traditional school of chicago politics by which you mean corrupt or led an independent or reform movement in fact while traveling around america as the candidate of change you recently told the tribune editorial board that you would leave criticism of chicago corruption up to others like john kass
3995937 there are more than 140 000 single parents in uniform nationwide and more and more are being asked to serve overseas or far away from their families
3995938 they put their lives on hold to defend us they shouldnt have to fear the loss of their children simply because they were called to duty
3995939 this bill would specify that military activation cannot be used as a reason to justify permanent changes in custody or visitation cases in pennsylvania
3995940 you have evaluators who really dont understand alienation and people who want to apply it in every case
3995941 its junk science used to target women and take their custody rights away
3995942 her recommendation led to me only getting my daughter for supervised visits
3995943 when i saw her she acted traumatized and seemed totally out of it
3995944 i knew that the more i tried to do something about it the more i would be accused of alienation
3995945 ninety eight percent of the time that you see abuse charges that have not been verified by police those allegations are coached
3995946 they call me a violent man they say i am aggravating
3995947 i had a bad custody evaluator and now i barely see them
3995948 standards generally accepted by the medical psychiatric legal and psychological communities
3995949 the thinking was that if you mentioned specific syndromes or disorders people who would use them in evaluations would just start calling them by a different name
3995950 it starts out strong and then it gets watered down and a lot of the great stuff gets thrown out
3995951 courts are ruling in favor of people unfairly accused of alienation and they are ruling against people who have been alienated
3995952 problems described by advocates on both sides on the issue are happening
3995953 the medicine is given orally you put it on his tongue
3995954 the mission that i have set is to guarantee that these kids have the best life they can lead
3995955 as far as a real family surrounding they didnt have one liza began running away by about eighth grade she would stay gone for 10 days a couple weeks
3995956 but more than anyone she knew if liza didnt slow down she was headed for trouble
3995957 she seemed to feel that a mother needed to be clean and having the equivalent of a high school degree might help her
3995958 i think i was a little hard on her because i wanted the best for her and i knew this wasnt it
3995959 and so they kicked her out of the whole thing thinking she was not as serious as they thought she should have been
3995960 the girls are gonna be taken care of just get yourself together
3995961 auntie ima do it i want to be just like you
3995962 shed just call and hang up to let me know she was fine
3995963 once she stopped by to bring all these gifts for the girls i thought that was nice because usually people with habits are so selfish i asked where she was getting money she said she had picked up a side job painting
3995964 right then i pledged to be the one they could always count on
3995965 its the reason ive got these babies today its the reason im making preparations for them to have a good life and go to college its the reason why some good is gonna come of this and why this daughter to daughter curse will stop here
3995966 its getting to a point where its like shes talking to me in my dreams
3995967 its a lot but im just believing i took this on myself so i do most of the work
3995968 ive been very successful with my own children and i know this is what liza wanted
3995969 in the midst of moving back and forward liza lost nearly all the pictures
3995970 during that time i prayed so hard for liza to get off those streets
3995971 i should have been more careful in asking maybe it was gods way of answering that prayer
3995972 of course the girls bring me joy but the feeling is an aching pain that never stops some things you get tired of you never think you will miss
3995973 a parent entitled to the custody of a child has a right to change the residence of the child subject to the power of the court to restrain a removal that would prejudice the rights or welfare of the child
3995974 footnote 12 of the burgess decision the court held that where there is a shared custody relationship the court would have to make a new or
3995975 in making an order for custody if the court does not consider it inappropriate the court may specify that a parent shall notify the other parent if the parent plans to change the residence of the child for more than 30 days unless there is prior written agreement to the removal the notice shall be given before the contemplated move by mail return receipt requested postage prepaid to the last known address of the parent to be notified a copy of the notice shall also be sent to that parents counsel of record to the extent feasible the notice shall be provided within a minimum of 45 days before the proposed change of residence so as to allow time for mediation of a new agreement concerning custody this section does not affect orders made before january 1 1989
3995976 aktivitas ini berlangsung kurang lebih dua pekan terakhir di areal hutan produksi lahan gambut desa pematang gadung sekitar 35 hektar hutan produktif yang akan dijadikan hutan lindung telah dirambah
3995977 desa sedang mengusulkan agar lahan gambut yang masih sangat lebat hutannya dapat dijadikan lokasi pelepasan satwa liar terutama orang utan
3995978 kita memang merencanakan menjadikan kawasan areal hutan produksi itu menjadi hutan lindung atau mungkin hutan lindung desa karena kawasan ini masih banyak menyimpan kekayaan flora dan fauna salah satunya orang utan sangat disayangkan jika rusak
3995979 kita sulit untuk bertindak tegas sebab khawatir berbenturan dengan masyarakat namun kita sudah mengingatkan mereka yang beraktivitas
3995980 masyarakat kita sering latah jika melihat orang lain aman dalam berbuat pelanggaran seperti il maka mereka pun ikut ikutan
3995981 the presence or absence of a disability doesnt predict quality of life
3995982 surely it will not be argued that the national spinal cord injury association the national down syndrome congress the disability rights education and defense fund and all the rest are now or ever have been puppets of religious conservatives
3995983 the peculiar drama of my life has placed me in a world that by and large thinks it would be better if people like me did not exist
3995984 my fight has been for accommodation the world to me and me to the world
3995985 semua pelaku il ketapang yang diproses mabes polri telah dilimpahkan seluruhnya ke kejari ketapang guna proses hukum berikutnya
3995986 keduanya sudah masuk dan dibawa langsung oleh pak farid kita masukkan di blok tahanan b 2 b bergabung dengan tahanan lainnya mereka kita perlakukan sama dan tidak ada yang diistimewakan semua sama rata apalagi kondisi ruang tahanan kita sudah melebihi kapasitas
3995987 informasi yang saya dapatkan katanya hanya dua orang ini saja sfl dan fdl red yang akan diproses lebih lanjut hingga ke pengadilan sedangkan yang lainnya tidak terbukti mungkin mereka dibebaskan tetapi saya juga belum tahu persis dan ini informasi yang saya dapat sementara yang pasti dua orang sudah kita terima
3995988 justru mantan pejabat dan aparat mendapatkan hukuman lebih meskipun bukan pelaku utama tetapi mereka yang memberikan jalan kepada pelaku dalam membalak hutan di ketapang
3995989 saya khawatir kalau tidak dikawal elemen eksekutif legislatif dan masyarakat proses hukumnya buram dan tersangka divonis ringan atau bahkan bebas
3995990 ini penting karena saya dengar sejumlah tersangka yang sekarang ditahan itu merasa iri dan diperlakukan tidak adil mereka yang pejabat polisi itu tidak ditahan di tempat yang sama padahal mereka juga mencicipi hasil kegiatan ilegal yang dilakukan bahkan mungkin nilainya lebih besar
3995991 we were keen to support the event because of what the co op and others are doing in relation to seafood policy because its bringing about a change in fishing policy
3995992 they are investing money in trying to promote fisheries which might want to apply for certification from the marine stewardship council but perhaps didnt have enough funds to do it themselves
3995993 ive been working in this area for about 17 years and in the last three years ive seen an incredibly positive change in the behaviour of fisheries in the uk
3995994 ultimately what it depends upon is fishermen changing the bad practices from the past such as throwing fish back over the side and retailers paying a premium for quality products
3995995 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
3995996 what about the united states god ordained mission to bring democracy and freedom to everyone around the globe
3995997 lha sampeyan iki piyee thoo ngapain dibeli kalo ujung2nya bikin sampeyan stress
3995998 the abuse of electronic messaging systems to indiscriminately send unsolicited bulk messages
3995999 people say that the past is history and the future is mystery but what you are now is most important thats why it is called the present

3996004 the mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell and a hell of heaven
3996005 there are many athletes like me who never get the help
3996006 we are left uneducated unable to have children and destroyed by a system that told us it would take care of us forever

3996008 pemimpin pas bertemu dengan pimpinan umno adalah restu daripada majlis syura ulama dan rundingan yang diadakan bukan untuk mendapatkan kerusi atau jawatan
3996009 tetapi apa yang kita lakukan untuk memastikan mereka menerima islam
3996010 perlukan kepemimpinan ulama hanya mengutamakan pandangan aspek politik semata mata dan meninggalkan perkara sebenar dalam dakwah
3996011 sayangilah jemaah dengan panduan al quran dan bukan sahaja dengan kepentingan politik
3996012 pastikan segala langkah yang diambil oleh ahli mestilah berdasarkan panduan dari al quran
3996013 oh shes quarter eskimo one eighth brazilian a sixth turkish a twenty fourth djiboutian and a fifth adopted by madonna
3996014 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
3996015 everyone has been very eager to help everyone except mary kate
3996016 did it come from a dealer from a friend if he had a bottle from a friend was it taken by someone else before police responded that is what is trying to be determined
3996017 j lo was crying and upset her arms had been locked upright in an uncomfortable position for at least an hour she was breaking down
3996018 britney and lee hit it off immediately he is her perfect type
3996019 theyve been having a great time in mexico lee put a smile on her face
3996020 brit and lee spent so much time together that one thing led to another and their relationship became physical
3996021 who wouldnt be flattered that a celebrity is interested in them
3996022 they dont judge criticise or compete they nurture even famous men like to be nutured
3996023 to be married to another famous person was a huge pressure one i didnt enjoy
3996024 viv is proving to resemble ange in spirit attitude and physicality
3996025 they were really affectionate with each other and gave each other a kiss which lasted much longer then a platonic kiss
3996026 she turns to her exes after most of her break ups
3996027 kate and eric have been holed up at her parents house in canada hes been a great support for her
3996028 they have definitely been talking hanging out and yes hooking up
3996029 kate is very private and refuses to be seen with him in public
3996030 i stay away from the tabloids im not going to talk about lindsay because shes my friend you know shes great shes also 22 years old i think people forget that
3996031 with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
3996032 the whitebait spawn where grasses clump together and form a dense root mat where there is almost 100 percent humidity its not uncommon for different generations of fish to choose the same clump of grass for egg laying
3996033 the west coast famous for whitebait has seen massive dairying conversions in the last few years too frequently this has been to the detriment of the local environment as some farmers choose to put profit ahead of all else
3996034 the whitebait tradition is dear to most new zealanders as is the delicious whitebait fritter but this tradition is increasingly more difficult to secure as we experienced during last years meagre season
3996035 were going to do an obama benefit on the 23rd of september at the wiltern theater in los angeles hes the better candidate and more in line with our views im just a liberal guy
3996036 weve been doing political benefits for years and its an endorsement i did it for senator john carey and that didnt work weve supported lots of different causes tried to legalise weed and that didnt work

3996039 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3996040 i have heard the russian president say that his military operations are over i am saying it is time for the russian president to be true to his word
3996041 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbour occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3996042 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3996043 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3996044 we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3996045 either support for a virtual project or real partnership on issues that really demand collective action
3996046 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3996047 we have no need nor do we intend to take over any georgian air or seaport to deliver humanitarian aid for those caught in this conflict
3996048 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
3996049 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight
3996050 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3996051 europe has to get engaged physically on the ground and europe has to stop that from happening
3996052 the european union cannot be indifferent to this war these massacres on our doorstep
3996053 the european union will want to consider how it proceeds with the partnership and cooperation agreement
3996054 it just doesnt seem to me to be very smart in such a time of crisis to decide whether we should revert to the previous situation
3996055 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods
3996056 europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient
3996057 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
3996058 as a precautionary measure and in agreement with the food standards agency we are making consumers aware of the possible presence of pieces of black rubber in a small number of packets of walkers crisps multi packs
3996059 although we believe the chances of finding a piece of rubber in a packet of crisps are small we advise anyone who has bought the specified product to be alert
3996060 he came up and started stabbing her immediately without any words or argument
3996061 he did not stop his murderous acts voluntarily but because of the heroic acts of the neighbor
3996062 a medal was not a long shot but it was an outside shot and its great when everybody gets this level of payback
3996063 you hope for a medal but you have to keep it secret
3996064 she trained for the descent not the climb because that was going to be her weakness
3996065 it was a rolling course and emma was eighth so we said you know what the olympic course is much more mountainous so if we really focus on this how much more progress could we make
3996066 we pulled together a group of specialists coaches psychologists bike experts into a kind of commando unit we called it project pooley
3996067 we developed a completely different bike that allowed her to make use of her very small size which is fantastic for going up hills but not much good for coming down when it is about power
3996068 the problem was there was not a lot of proprietary equipment out there on the mainstream market that was small enough
3996069 so we developed something special for her that allows her to get into that really tucked position coming down because her advantage is that being small she doesnt hit a lot of air
3996070 she did brilliantly as she took time out of most of the big names in cycling on the descent which is incredible everyone except armstrong who got the gold
3996071 ones natural reaction is to back off the pedals as soon as the road starts sloping down
3996072 but like anything else it is trainable to reduce that what she would have been trying to achieve is exactly the same power uphill as down the only thing that changes is the speed
3996073 its so hard for the writers to just even get through the season theyre very good but its just the equivalent of making 12 films a year and then they have to come up with a whole new idea in the break for the next year
3996074 the key to is using the pieces as staples in your wardrobe of course they are perfect for special occasions but we urge our clients to think about how else they can wear them mix shorter dresses with jeans and pants or wrap a gorgeous chunky leather belt around your waist to add a bit of edge and attitude
3996075 i believe in the potential for san pedro to grow and the need to embrace change not all change is good and i believe it is the important role of the council to determine and weigh the benefits and the costs of change i run a performing arts company that originated in downtown san pedro i believe this historic area is on the verge of great growth and opportunity and i want to be a voice that represents the downtown interests i bring with me the unique experience of running a non profit and years of working as a union actor a union stage manager and union singer the arts can change attitudes educate and stimulate commerce making san pedro a true destination
3996076 i felt obligated to submit my name for consideration but wrestled with the idea until after the deadline for being on the ballot had passed
3996077 the video saved my client from possibly going to prison for the rest of his life
3996078 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
3996079 for a player its not the greatest feeling sitting in the stands watching the team play in a must win game
3996080 i hope this never happens to me ever again i want to be on the field helping the guys out i felt bad
3996081 freddy had a good tournament he has a good mentality and a very good future in the team
3996082 he needs to establish himself he needs to play because with every single game he got better its a question of continuity
3996083 first we had the dutch with all of their stars then we had the tricky japanese and the americans who are physically strong and better than most people might think
3996084 were playing the ball around on the pitch one touch two touch we dont want to hit it up the field and run after it to me thats not football
3996085 with me victor obinna peter odemwingie and the other guys in the team our understanding is growing with every game we are getting stronger and were playing better football
3996086 we are trying our best to go as far as we can
3996087 we cant really start talking about medals at this point because every team left in this tournament can hurt us
3996088 desde luego no estaba a favor de despenalizar sin embargo durante el tiempo que pas en la unidad conforme v m s pruebas sobre lo que funciona por citar el mantra del nuevo laborismo de la poca se hizo evidente para m que la persecuci n y las intervenciones dirigidas a intentar afectar el suministro de drogas eran en gran medida in tiles no tienen un efecto duradero en la disponibilidad acceso y uso de drogas

3996110 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3996111 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
3996112 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3996113 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3996114 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted
3996115 we expect him to break world records we expect him to win
3996116 hysteria exposing the secret agenda behind todays obsession with global warming
3996117 i just learned a new put down your look is violating national interests

3996121 doesnt know much but leads the league in nostril hair
3996122 russias position right now is that they are trying to reaffirm their status in their world
3996123 they have an interest in showing that they are tough in south ossetia and that they are also not going to be pushed around by the west when it comes to iran
3996124 in the short term the russian interest is likely to say that they will not be pushed around not relative to georgia or on other issues
3996125 if they feel the us is cooperative then they are cooperative on iran
3996126 and if not they feel they can hurt the us on iran
3996127 mo has the ability to space the floor hes shown himself to be a good shooter

3996129 all these guys are very excited they respect mo as a player and theyre looking forward to playing with him

3996133 thats got to be about 80 of our kids taking the test so thats pretty positive
3996134 its a gamble but its the right gamble to take
3996135 both of those are key says act doing some preparation of what the test format is like but also having a rigorous and challenging curriculum for kids
3996136 that means that youll sync less and get the data you care about faster than before this will be a plus for everyone but will especially benefit edge users and those with spotty connections
3996137 its the kind of mosquito that bites birds not people

3996139 for most people they might experience flu like symptoms with west nile but except for perhaps the elderly or infants it is not anything like triple e
3996140 fortunately there have been no cases of triple e reported in massachusetts this year it goes on a seven year cycle and i think we are in a down year after all the activity we had
3996141 its one thing to stand for things its another to stand up for things
3996142 and i think if charles dickens were alive today he would in many ways echo the fact that those achievements as well as others like raising the minimum wage twice are in many cases the best of times
3996143 i dont think there are any serious talks or serious negotiations going on
3996144 we expect a considerable number of people to return home today since late wednesday they were slowly going back we are assuring them of their safety
3996145 the security situation has improved but it will probably take a bit of time before people feel secure enough to return home en masse
3996146 we have to be looking ahead to people having to potentially rebuild their lives a lot of houses villages have been destroyed
3996147 some of them need a little counselling most do not a lot of them are used to it its not the first time that this has happened

3996151 the football boys have done wonder to the country i wanted to go to watch the match yesterday but couldnt as i was busy in many other works like monika and all
3996152 as i have returned from beijing on wednesday only i got less time but in future i will definitely be present to watch the match
3996153 because football is the mass sports it is of the same stature as cricket is in our country
3996154 it was a very commendable performance by an 18 year old girl making her debut in the games i would like to meet her and congratulate her when she comes back to india from beijing and i have told my officials regarding this

3996159 i think it is really a reward for the trade union leaders whove supported us and members who had to make substantial commitments to the future
3996160 they made big decisions in the 80s and 90s which i think has stood the nation in good stead really
3996161 and its a recognition of their contribution rather than me personally
3996162 the workplace is like australia as a whole its changing its changing rapidly
3996163 what i think has been able to be demonstrated is that youve got to change with it and in some senses in advance of it in order to make progress
3996164 you dont strive for recognition when you join something like the police force but the recognition is nice and i think it says a lot for the people ive been able to work with

3996172 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
3996173 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbors that what it thinks about u s policy
3996174 het was een goede race ik was opnieuw sneller dan mijn wereldrecord van acht jaar geleden maar nu baal ik ik zou ook een waardeloze sportman zijn als ik hier met een glimlach op mijn gezicht rond zou lopen

3996177 we are we are the saints we signed our life away
3996178 people are still taking their trips theyre just staying closer to home
3996179 whats helping us is our location to so many areas
3996180 if someone is in the new york metro area they may not drive to the outer banks or as far as virginia but they can still come and experience pennsylvania
3996181 we started limiting driving when gas hit three bucks at 3 80 it got even worse
3996182 roads and bridges will suffer as a result of less fuel being sold
3996183 people are doing a lot better job of planning than they used to
3996184 they are being selective about where they are driving and how far they are driving people are sort of in limbo waiting to see when this is going to level out
3996185 you wont see the same change in quarter four of this year where well see some of the cheapest gas prices this year
3996186 were becoming desensitized to high gas prices we resume our old habits when gas prices start going down

3996188 there were some days in there waiting for results when it was pretty tenuous
3996189 its great news weve still got to wait for the spleen to shrink a little more before theyre going to really let me start going crazy but todays a step in the right direction no question
3996190 you want to put them in as many stressful situations as they can handle and hope they get better at handling it
3996191 i think theyve done some really good things and i think theyve made mistakes
3996192 i would think its not going to take him very long

3996232 its fantastic to have a coach give you 100 per cent backing and let you know that you are going to be an important part of the team and an important part of the club harnwell said
3996233 im looking forward to repaying that faith and going out and hopefully scoring more goals than i did last year
3996234 the way its all turned about has been fantastic harnwell said
3996235 rons decision to throw me up front has reaped a lot of benefits for myself and its given me a chance to showcase a completely different side of my game
3996236 im really enjoying being that creative player and doing the flicks and the little turns and scoring goals
3996237 its been a lot of fun and its contributed to me being able to start enjoying myself a lot more after the last year or so
3996238 a big part of me staying and finishing out my career here was because i wanted to see this club successful again and playing finals football so thats the one aim for the team this season he said

3996246 the geographic base of the terrorists who have had us under assault for many years but most especially on 9 11
3996247 we dont want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud
3996248 no evidence that hussein had passed illicit weapons material to al qaeda or other terrorist organizations or had any intent to do so
3996249 there was a risk a real risk that saddam hussein would pass weapons or materials or information to terrorist networks
3996250 the vast majority of my tax cuts go to the bottom end of the spectrum
3996251 you cant distinguish between al qaeda and saddam when you talk about the war on terror
3996252 mugabe wanted tsvangirai as a ceremonial prime minister there was never any serious intent by mugabe to give up power
3996253 there is no future for these talks unless the facilitator mbeki is able to come forward with proposals that demonstrate a change in mugabes position
3996254 the pressure only went one way on tsvangirai and he had no proposals to break the logjam
3996255 we cannot at the moment say what motivated the attack the enemy are changing tactics they are fanatics
3996256 i condemn this cowardly act in the strongest possible terms and urge the authorities to leave no stone unturned in the search for the perpetrators
3996257 we havent seen as direct attack on the aid community as this for many years
3996258 milf forces are abiding by orders to reposition but militias and troops are firing on them
3996259 if the fighting spreads to other areas in mindanao then the talks will surely be at risk
3996260 we want to dislodge them from villages until all the areas are cleared so civilians can return peacefully
3996261 i think as a new team or as a new partnership between myself mike canney co driver and the whole effort i think everyone has done a fantastic job right out of the box being fastest and nearly winning daytona going to lime rock and being as good as the mustangs were going to be there and then mosport being on the podium we definitely started out strong we just had a couple of misfortunes with not finishing at birmingham getting taken out basically in the first lap and then going to iowa where although there are places for the mustangs to stretch its legs it really didnt get a chance just getting up to fourth gear as a whole the mustang was great handling wise for the bigger car that it is but we just didnt have anything for the porsches and bmws in iowa so it has been a bit of a rollercoaster season its mikes second year of pro racing so hes definitely on a steep learning curve but hes very competitive and very willing to move on to be the best that he can be and keep trying to plug along and to move up there to the championship
3996262 i think that the mustang being a little bit bigger of a car little heavier and the roll center being a little bit higher its made me change a little bit as far as driving style and how to handle the car mid corner
3996263 overall i love driving the car id like to get the chance to drive in this particular car a little bit more whether its in the gt car because i think its got a ton of potential i think that we need to test more and we need to develop the car i think its got more potential than what were seeing right now
3996264 back in 1993 when i started to work malaysians thought that only drug abusers and sex workers could catch aids
3996265 and they imams took it very much positively as they were already facing the problem from the locality they belonged to
3996266 so dont miss the opportunity you need to act fast as it would be more cost effective now
3996267 people are fleeing there is a mood of absolute panic the idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous
3996268 they asked villagers to hang white flags or handkerchiefs outside their houses if they did not want to be shot they say
3996269 behind them say eyewitnesses is a whole column of irregulars who locals say are chechens cossacks and ossetians
3996270 eyewitnesses say they are looting killing and burning these irregulars have killed three people and set fire to villages they have been taking away young boys and girls
3996271 for three hours there were people fleeing in cars i saw one with 11 people and a lada with eight people in it
3996272 were reported to have been seen in the village of tedotsminda near gori
3996273 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3996274 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3996275 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3996276 reserves the right to take whatever action it deems necessary

3996282 the army and security forces will not yield to attempts to terrorise them with attacks and crimes
3996283 the investigation has begun and there are many interpretations political interpretations
3996284 newspapers in pakistan im afraid dream up things then start writing about them theres no such thing
3996285 people have given us their vote of trust we dont have trust in you musharraf so its logical and legal that you should leave
3996286 three foreign women employees of irc international rescue committee and their local driver were killed in this ambush by the opposition forces
3996287 we are still contacting the next of kin we hope to have a statement in the next couple of hours
3996288 its a dreadful shock it really is very very sad news
3996289 obviously working in a country like that there are always risks but i dont think there were any specific problems
3996290 winning it once does not erase the abysmal record he has had
3996291 we want someone who is a strong advocate for our positions and not a candidate for the best supporting actor award who is being what somebody wants him to be
3996292 supporting legislation that helps grow the economy and creates new jobs for hardworking americans
3996293 the chamber is grateful for nicks commitment to these important issues
3996294 because they recognize i am focused on making sure american families can be successful through lower taxes expanded energy production and new health care options to cover millions of uninsured small business employees

3996306 being county judge is not really about me me me

3996308 one of the things ive found in my business experience and i think mr emmett saw this boy the easiest thing in the world is to kill a deal the hardest thing in the world is to get it to the finish line

3996312 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3996313 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3996314 we will now need to review the full range of our relations
3996315 has been very clear for a long time ive been very concerned about russian behavior in a broad variety of areas
3996316 address the future of the alliances relationship with russia and with our g7 partners we should discuss whether it makes sense for russia to continue its participation in the g8
3996317 we also need to review russias aspiration for membership in the world trade organization
3996318 i dont think were going to reignite the cold war here with russia i dont see this is a return to nuclear standoffs
3996319 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3996320 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3996321 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3996322 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3996323 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
3996324 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3996325 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it

3996327 we have called a meeting of state oil companies on tuesday to discuss shortages in some parts like maharashtra there is a 23 24 percent unforeseen increase in demand because it is being used in power generation
3996328 decline in the global oil prices is a welcome development but there is no scope for reduction in domestic prices
3996329 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people
3996330 that is simply not the way in which international relations can be run in the 21st century
3996331 weve got to make sure that the russians realise that they do have rights in the international system but they must be allied with responsibilities
3996332 and when responsibilities are not upheld there are political consequences for russia
3996333 its unprecedented since the g8 became the g8 in the 1990s for seven countries to come together without an eighth country but that has happened over the last few days and i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3996334 its going to have a huge impact on his brand because what theyve been trying to do with the li ning brand businessweek com 5 1 08 is to make it seem more global you cant get a better stage than the opening ceremony of a global event like the olympics
3996335 we are quite happy with our business here in china
3996336 we also believe that this growth will continue for the next several years here in china first and foremost because our brand is extremely strong here

3996343 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3996344 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3996345 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3996346 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3996347 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3996348 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3996349 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3996350 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3996351 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3996352 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
3996353 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3996354 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3996355 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3996356 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3996357 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3996358 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3996359 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them

3996363 for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it not everybody can go on the cover of playboy
3996364 i did it because i am confident of my body and myself

3996367 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3996368 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
3996369 for another two days russian troops will stay in the region to carry out procedures of handing over control functions to georgian law enforcement bodies after which they will leave
3996370 all buildings are in normal shape the town is supplied with water and electricity
3996371 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbours that what it thinks about u s policy
3996372 pointed out that leaders at all levels must deeply understand that the struggle against the three forces is one of life or death
3996373 in xinjiang the fight against separatist forces is long term arduous and complex
3996374 stick to a strategy of seizing the initiative to strike pre emptively closely guard against and attack separatist sabotage by the three forces and never allow our enemies to gain strength
3996375 after the incident relevant authorities handled it according to law preserved social stability and the normal order of work and life
3996376 ethnic unity and unity between the races must be preserved

3996383 welcome to the golden state warrior cheerleader girl calendar shoot
3996384 its sad because not everyone is going to make it back next year
3996385 russias position right now is that they are trying to reaffirm their status in their world
3996386 they have an interest in showing that they are tough in south ossetia and that they are also not going to be pushed around by the west when it comes to iran
3996387 in the short term the russian interest is likely to say that they will not be pushed around not relative to georgia or on other issues
3996388 if they feel the us is cooperative then they are cooperative on iran
3996389 and if not they feel they can hurt the us on iran
3996390 michael i think you bring up a good point and

3996394 at least for the time being since the news flow is over at this point of time i would book some profits in the fertilizer space especially in stocks like chambal fert and nagarjuna fert because at least for the next couple of months i really do not see much of an upside one cannot expect any more news flows going ahead
3996395 in 1qfy09 karur vysya banks kvb net interest income de grew by 2 to rs 891 million marginally lower than our estimates of rs 941 million mainly due to decline in casa deposits share and higher deposits costs kvbs net interest margin drifted down by 91 bps to 2 64 from 3 55 in 1qfy08
3996396 due to much higher increase in liabilities cost partial pass on of incremental costs and higher investment depreciation we reduce our fy09 and fy10 earning estimates by 33 and 23 respectively and reduce our target price by 34 to rs 306 we rate the stock as an under performer with price target of rs 306
3996397 again dlf is forming a sort of a bearish wedge pattern where at higher levels it is unable to make a lot of progress so probably it is a good short right now and you could get levels of about rs 475
3996398 for icici bank rs 720 725 was a stiff sort of a resistance it failed on that resistance and now you could get levels of rs 620 back the whole point is that all these stocks went up to important resistances and instead of crossing them they sort of held them for a day or two and then have started falling back this creates a problem because at resistances fresh buying is not coming in then the whole move becomes suspect

3996401 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3996402 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3996403 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3996404 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3996405 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3996406 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3996407 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3996408 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3996409 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3996410 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3996411 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3996412 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3996413 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3996414 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3996436 we have not zeroed in on anyone as of now but hope to get important leads soon
3996437 if he doesnt ill ask him again im going to get booed out of town anyway
3996438 no one has been coming close to you thats mostly because you dont want them to
3996439 we have no intention of letting hirvonen and team mate jari matti latvala strike back on an event that has always favoured us

3996521 we understand that its a unique opportunity here specifically but weve got to do the best thing for our basketball team and we feel like the best thing for our basketball team is to add some toughness and some intangibles defensively for us at that position

3996555 one officer asked me in english what were my views of tibet
3996556 i told him i was a journalist and didnt have any views
3996557 one of our chinese staff asked why they arrested me and an officer said didnt you see
3996558 pointing to the yellow cloth they had thrown into the van
3996559 i was there merely to report not to take part in anything i didnt have a banner i didnt have a t shirt i was wearing pretty standard foreign correspondent garb
3996560 er vloog van alles door de lucht ik ben ook maar even uit de buurt gebleven dit tekent wel hoe groot de sporter pieter is het was niet goed als hij hier had rondgelopen alsof hij net boodschappen had gedaan
3996561 twice i was told it was the end of my career he said
3996562 water polo is hard to get out of the system
3996563 we had a good shot but we missed our chances coach terry schroeder said
3996564 its tough but we just got our american record by four seconds
3996565 i think shes enjoying things more after winning the 100 backstroke
3996566 she and i process information the same way if you go through it and have an idea of how it works and what to expect its easier im just proud of how shes managing her number of events and her responsibilities you only get that with experience
3996567 its disappointing if both americans dont make the top eight that competitiveness look how difficult it is to be on the relays
3996568 they are world class players and we expected nothing less
3996569 ich gehe davon aus dass die russen verstanden haben dass ein berspannen des bogens tiefgreifende konsequenzen f r ihre stellung im internationalen staatensystem haben wird
3996570 wird das nur zu einer vertieften isolation russlands f hren
3996571 lets not talk about that and just hope it continues
3996572 we got good hitting both games and really good pitching
3996573 our bullpen came in and did a good job what else can i say
3996574 we were behind 4 0 by the second inning both games
3996575 its frustrating to play so poorly today we just didnt do anything good
3996576 i apologized to him and i apologized to my teammates
3996577 i told him that hes one of our leaders here and theres no reason for that
3996578 weve got pitchers who can do that to the other team too
3996579 they do that to us why cant we do that to them
3996580 you have to live with that stuff its been around since the beginning of the game
3996581 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
3996582 political stability in my view can only be brought through a reconciliation approach as opposed to confrontation
3996583 the era of repression is over forever dictatorship has become a tale of the past
3996584 the war against extremism and terrorism is a war for our own survival
3996585 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
3996586 russias attack on neighboring georgia over two tiny separatist provinces is really about something much bigger russian leader vladimir putins desire to restore the former ussrs might russias ill intentions clearly are on display in georgia in a fit of nationalist fury it wants to teach georgia and other former satellite countries that once made up the soviet bloc that its pro western rapprochement days are over what better way than to invade a former republic humiliate its leaders and then taunt the west for failing to come to its aid as if that wasnt enough russia immediately began threatening its other neighbors a top russian diplomat ominously warned monday that latvia estonia lithuania and poland would pay for criticizing russias imperialist policy toward georgia russias claim to support independence from georgia of tiny south ossetia and even tinier abkhazia is simply phony georgia with its strategically important oil pipeline has grown close to the u s even sending troops to iraq putin furious at growing u s and nato ties with eastern europe wanted to emasculate georgias military while deposing its pro american president mikheil saakashvili with his attack it looks like hes succeeding the symbolism of the invasion coming at the start of the beijing olympics is unmistakable this is russias wake up call to all of us communism may be dead putin is saying but russia isnt
3996587 this break is absolutely essential for all the people who travel
3996588 they dont get the right amount of time with their families and this gives them an opportunity to have at least one week where they are not at the office or workshop
3996589 its a key ingredient of keeping people motivated and happy when you are addressing the calendar which makes next years difficult for them
3996590 it is bitterly disappointing for luke and we wish him all the best for a speedy recovery but both brett sheehan and sam cordingley have been putting up their hand and are itching for the opportunity to play in the nine jersey

3996596 there are 47 million americans who have no health insurance
3996597 we need a universal plan to get all of them some coverage maybe everyone wont be able to get a heart transplant but they need some health coverage
3996598 give some health coverage to all people if some want a cadillac plan or a mercedes that would be for the botox and enhancement procedures then they can pay for that
3996599 people without health care coverage are going there for rudimentary treatments they are sick but they dont have coverage and need treatment
3996600 or workmans compensation or social security or medicare or the 40 hour work week they were all developed by the labor movement and the democratic party
3996601 special interest groups have divided us we have to stay strong and work to make the middle class strong again
3996602 we have to get everyone to the table the health care delivery system the insurance industry the pharmaceutical companies and the medical manufacturers and work together to control costs
3996603 what will it take for people to rise up and fight for what is right
3996604 it took the price of a gallon of gas to get to 4 before people adjusted their lifestyles and now the price is coming down
3996605 a patient will always tell you they smoke less than they do because they feel guilty as soon as you ask
3996606 smoking is like breathing in exhaust fumes so of course it is going to affect a mother and foetus but there are people who tell you their baby was fine even though they smoked throughout the pregnancy i would say perhaps the placenta didnt implant as well as it could have or vessel growth wasnt as optimal as it could have been if they had been non smokers
3996607 we need to make sure women are strongly advised against smoking every time they visit a health professional

3996621 ich hatte mich schon als kind sehr f r den handballsport begeistert in der dritten klasse wurde ich dann in der schule gesichtet und bin dann ab der 4 klasse ins trainingszentrum in wismar eingetreten
3996622 ich hatte auf jeden fall das gl ck beide seiten kennen zu lernen denn man versteht die damals betreuenden trainer heute viel besser da man jetzt die spielerischen dinge von der seite des trainers sieht und erlebt
3996623 f r uns ist das nat rlich ein gro er verlust denn dieses pferd war im gel nde kaum zu schlagen
3996624 die vijfde plaats is een bittere pil voor hem in je laatste optreden er zo dichtbij zitten en dan het podium missen is heel zuur
3996625 het was niet zijn beste race ooit en dat zal hem best steken hij had verwacht nog een stukje harder te zwemmen dan in de halve finales waar hij zijn persoonlijk record verbeterde dat acht jaar stond maar dat heeft ook een oorzaak door blessures en priv problemen heeft hij de afgelopen jaren niet optimaal kunnen trainen dan is het heel knap dat hij toch nog vijfde wordt
3996626 het is hem zo ontzettend gegund om nog een keer olympisch kampioen te worden het was zijn ultieme droom en die ziet hij uiteen spatten in zijn laatste race ooit
3996627 the deceleration in export growth was the main reason for the slowdown in industrial output

3996629 het zal raar zijn om straks pieter niet meer bij iedere training in het bad te zien
3996630 maar hij moet nog aftrainen dus we komen elkaar nog vaak tegen pas als de meiden hem voorbij gaan zwemmen is hij echt klaar

3996653 but she won only by minutes our cyclist the photographer james brickwood swore he would have taken the prize had he not been asked to shoot a bit of video during his journey
3996654 and believe me london is by no means at the forefront of cycling
3996655 you have to be much more careful here than in london because the drivers here are so much more hostile
3996656 apparently he is quite hostile to cyclists but i cant understand how anyone in this day and age can be like that particularly with petrol prices going up
3996657 i think you need a serious education campaign its a matter of creating a culture where its acceptable to cycle
3996658 once you start putting in the infrastructure like bike lanes and signs and give cyclists priority then drivers will accept them
3996659 sydney has around 2000 kilometres of cycle facilities while london only has 550 kilometres

3996663 there is absolutely no way that i am trying to or will be involved in any process to cover anything up mr carpenter told reporters today
3996664 i want to make sure that everything that happens is revealed in an objective way and that recommendations that come from this inquiry by nopsa are acted upon
3996665 i also give another commitment if it is deemed necessary at the end of this process that there be a broader inquiry even a royal commission then we will have one
3996666 but first of all lets allow this inquiry to take its course its obviously producing some interesting information about the nature of the inspection regime and the issues that flow from that
3996667 i cant stop them from doing that but i think the general public can see pretty much what the objective is he said
3996668 sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way
3996669 someone who makes millions of dollars in los angeles in a country and city with a strong asian american influence
3996670 as for the reaction here its always pretty much the same in these cases
3996671 people get defensive and dont understand what the big fuss is all about which i can understand in this case because there was no ill will intended
3996672 that wasnt the case with the incidents at the bernabeu game and the f1 circuit which were flat out embarrassing
3996673 people here dont appreciate being singled out as especially racist i dont have any numbers to support it but i would bet the farm that proportionally there are more interracial marriages and couples with men and women from different countries here than in most nations around spain yes we do have a problem with racism but just like everybody else

3996681 young people are missing out they are doing better than ever in science tests at 14 but hardly any are going on to study triple science gcse despite the opportunities and learning it offers
3996682 we need to create an environment in schools that reflects the importance of science and the value of studying it we also need to send an unambiguous message to young people who are good at science that science as a career can be fascinating and worthwhile and will reward you well
3996683 parents want the best for their children and they need to understand that triple science provides just that science skills gained today can be the pathway to a great career tomorrow it is essential that all our children have the chance of the best possible science education if they are to enjoy the employment opportunities of the future
3996684 application of advanced science and technology has never been more important to the energy industry there are great careers available in making sure the world has the energy it needs and in tackling climate change incentives for more children to take science at school could help produce the next generations of scientists and engineers that our industry really needs
3996685 i strongly endorse the idea of encouraging more children to take triple combined science rather than the less comprehensive single or double science gcse
3996686 rewarding careers are to be found in science and engineering at all levels and anything which encourages young people on paths in these directions is greatly to be encouraged
3996687 triple science gcse will give a better preparation for science a levels and therefore a better preparation for science degrees
3996688 the skills of problem solving enquiry and independent thinking that science encourages are also key for young people to be better equipped for the future
3996689 were facing a massive 160bn investment in the energy sector to rebuild and transform our ageing infrastructure this will need a whole new generation of engineers and scientists to design construct operate and maintain new power stations and networks and to drive innovation in low carbon technologies finally we seem to have a policy initiative which gets right to the heart and addresses the difficult underlying issues of science and maths education in school and higher education
3996690 getting more young people to opt for triple science at gcse level is absolutely crucial to increasing the number who go on to study it at a level and at our universities if they do there is a huge range of career choices out there for them helping to design and build a railway for 21st century britain is just one of them
3996691 with all young people who obtain level 6 in their key stage 3 science tests being entitled to take triple science gcse from september it will be crucial that we have enough good teachers to teach these subjects all of our secondary schools should have a specialist teacher in each of the three main school sciences who are able to inspire their students about the dynamism and excitement of their subject this will be an important part of encouraging students to continue their studies onto a level and beyond and those young people that do so will have the doors opened to a wide range of rewarding careers
3996692 we are doing everything in our power to make sure this doesnt happen again
3996693 vmware prides itself on the quality and reliability of our products and this incident has prompted a thorough self examination of how we create and deliver products to our customers we have kicked off a comprehensive in depth review of our qa and release processes and will quickly make the needed changes i want to apologize for the disruption and difficulty this issue may have caused to our customers and our partners your confidence in vmware is extremely important to us and we are committed to restoring that confidence fully and quickly

3996699 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill
3996700 the idea that there is a state called happiness and that we can dependably figure out what it feels like and how to measure it is extremely subversive
3996701 it allows economists to start thinking about life in richer terms to stop asking what did you buy and to start asking is your life good
3996702 for the time being we know that happiness fosters physical health but not precisely how
3996703 chronic unhappiness activates the fight flight response which is known to involve harmful effects in the long run such as higher blood pressure and a lower immune response
3996704 if we feel unhealthy we go to a medical general practitioner
3996705 if we feel unhappy there is no such generalist we have to guess

3996718 you have to believe the majority of the people otherwise you are misled
3996719 everybody can see that the olympic games are a great platform people are optimistic about their own future
3996720 i feel people come here to be critical that doesnt mean we are not fulfilling our promises

3996807 when a new user joins any web 2 0 platform such as youtube facebook or authorstream he does a lot of activities both explicitly and implicitly like in youtube he may explicitly upload video write a comment share it with his friends etc and similarly an authorstream user uploads and shares powerpoint presentations however when he clicks on the related presentation link he implicitly generates valuable information for authorstream data generated by its users lets authorstream make its related video algorithm stronger over time so to provide relevant results web 2 0 products need to store each users activity details which is why the data storage requirements are growing at a rapid pace
3996808 web 2 0 companies depend primarily on user generated content storage therefore is crucial in todays world of mainly free web services and users aim to use additional functions such as uploading images groups videos or comments
3996809 quantums stornext data management software enables systems to share a high speed pool of images media content analytical data and other key digital assets so that files can be processed and distributed quicker
3996810 companies based on a web 2 0 model depend mainly on ugc storage therefore is crucial in todays world of mainly free web services users aim to use additional functions such as uploading images groups videos or comments therefore any service provider of web 2 0 services needs to prepare for a constant increase of disk space a lack of storage space would be interpreted as user unfriendly
3996811 web 2 0 is all about ugc it is about sharing ones personal experience through photos videos audio amongst others with friends and family
3996812 computer power is cheaper and more plentiful anyone can purchase a 4 way quad core server with hundreds of gigabytes of internal storage and start providing web 2 0 services however as web 2 0 companies grow in popularity they quickly become victims of their own success and run out of storage space as their site or service becomes successful it will attract more users which in turn demands even greater storage space before they know it web 2 0 companies quickly outgrow their entire storage infrastructure for that reason before selling storage to a web 2 0 company you must take several factors into consideration including scalability data mobility security and disaster recovery or business continuity
3996813 as web 2 0 companies grow in popularity they quickly become victims of their own success and run out of storage space as their web site or service becomes more successful it will attract more users which in turn necessitates greater storage space
3996814 we currently use zabbix to monitor the operating systems health and other aspects of the file system our administrators have also created a few scripts to show the load and throughput of all our servers
3996815 we currently use zabbix to monitor the operating systems health and other aspects of the file system our administrators have also created a few scripts to show the load and throughput of all our servers we have not invested a substantial amount in storage since we are using off the shelf servers our distributed file system provides us with the required performance and redundancy
3996816 we keep user information and user enhanced content generated by side effects in our database servers moreover we store all flat file data video files presentations and other rich media formats on amazons s3 servers at the same time i think for web 2 0 startups outsourcing is an affordable solution to handle such large amounts of data
3996817 currently the service works on the basis of several high end servers our future investments are conditioned by the requirements that we will face in terms of increasing number of zaabiz members new functionalities offered or possible diversifications implemented
3996818 quantums stornext data management software enables customers to generate revenue faster and store more data at a lower cost combining high speed data sharing with cost effective content retention stornext helps customers build an infrastructure for consolidating resources so that workflow operations run faster and maintaining business assets costs less stornext enables systems to share a high speed pool of images media content analytical data and other key digital assets so files can be processed and distributed quicker even in heterogeneous environments all files are easily accessible to all hosts san or lan
3996819 we keep user information and user enhanced content in our database servers in addition we store all flat file data on amazons s3 servers for web 2 0 startups outsourcing is the affordable solution to handle such large amounts of data
3996820 we have planned our storage architecture in such a way that it can scale horizontally we add new clusters as soon as there is a requirement a storage cluster could consist of three or four high disk capacity boxes or a simple san
3996821 the tiered storage architecture is relevant to web 2 0 companies as this offers a scalable and cost effective architecture without compromising on the performance of an application the ideology behind this architecture is that the most performance intensive data resides on the high performance higher cost storage and the less performance intensive data on low cost storage with built in intelligence which allows policy creation to migrate data between the different tiers
3996822 the architecture of our storage requirements has been planned such that it can scale horizontally we add new clusters as soon as there is a requirement a storage cluster could be three or four high disk capacity boxes or a simple san
3996823 from the beginning we have been prepared for growing storage requirements in terms of technical equipment therefore we do not have any problems with storage at this moment and we do not foresee to any coming up in the future

3996861 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

3996866 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3996867 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3996868 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3996869 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3996870 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3996889 for obama it is significant that he will be participating as an equal on the same stage as mccain in an evangelical church this signals the shift in the evangelical political landscape since 2004
3996890 this has a lot less to do with what is going on in california and more to do with what is going on in ohio pennsylvania and florida the big swing states
3996891 in all of these states there is a sizable evangelical population that does not directly identify with the old religious right

3997039 leaders are made not born leadership is forged in times of crisis it is easy to sit there with your feet up on the desk and talk theory or send someone elses kids off to war when youve never seen a battlefield yourself its another thing to lead when your world comes tumbling down

3997042 copyrights and ownership will remain with the author creator however copyright permission to publish the entry and announce the winners name will be retained by the isde5 secretariat
3997043 that means that youll sync less and get the data you care about faster than before this will be a plus for everyone but will especially benefit edge users and those with spotty connections
3997044 this is an important question in my work as one of the problems weve been thinking about at the civil society communications project is how to get non profit organizations who often collect large amounts of data for advocacy purposes to think about visualizing that information rather than only collating it into a written report or a set of flat tables

3997046 none of my friends would have imagined me as an activist
3997047 they told me that even though i was an american citizen the chinese government doesnt recognize dual citizenship so i have no rights as an american by traveling on my taiwanese documents in china the chinese authorities have the right to detain me and to subject me to the full extent of chinese law
3997048 it was scary because they warned me if i was low profile now i will be high profile and i will be followed once i enter tibetan regions
3997049 but i felt that i couldnt let my fear stop me
3997050 the further west i went the more intense it got until i was very very scared
3997051 the local tibetans told me that these police stations had sprung up after the protests in march if theres a way to instill fear in people this is the way to do it youre not going to go out in the street and protest when you see fifty armed police to the left and right of you
3997052 my heart doesnt feel right if his photo isnt up somewhere
3997053 if you put up a photo in a temple that act cant necessarily be traced back to you but wearing a pendant is a very personal thing the tibetans take so many risks for this small freedom
3997054 it was really difficult for me to hear what they had to say the spectrum is just so far apart from what the tibetans believe and what the chinese believe the chinese say we developed this region we built these roads look at that hospital when you confront them with the bad things they focus on the good things they would say we referring to me as well i wanted to scream no no im not chinese they get to send their kids to school for free because theyre in a minority region and they make more money there but it really seems theyre taking over the economy and pushing tibetans further aside id heard about this id read about it id even talked about it but it wasnt until i was there that i could feel what occupation was actually like
3997055 theres a good reason that foreigners arent allowed in these places it looks like a war zone in kardze the police are in the middle of the sidewalks theyre sitting in helmets holding their guns and riot shields in rows of 10 or 15 they are outside convenience stores under blue tarps every half a block on both sides of the road watching theyre up on raised metal posts with cutout windows watching i couldnt walk anywhere without dozens of armed police staring at me ive never seen so many police and military personnel in one town in my life nor have i experienced this kind of heart pounding fear before
3997056 we must create more battlefields and united battle fronts each leader must re educate re plan pre olympics stability work and strictly prevent any incidents from happening
3997057 i cant imagine anyone protesting here any more because as soon as they do anything suspicious theyll be swept away we talk about freedom of speech but when youre under such heavy surveillance you cant even think about saying anything that these armed police dont want you to say
3997058 no theyre here to protect us why should we be scared
3997059 if the tibetans went wild and pulled out their swords again then these police would keep them in line
3997060 as soon as i arrived i went to check my email at an internet cafe i opened something from google notifications and found a message in broken english
3997061 were trying to promote awareness and dialogue about whats going on in tibet by raising tibetan flags worldwide id been in contact with people in dharamsala about the campaign its just become a part of the dialogue after i received this email from google i seriously considered going back for the first time i seriously feared for my safety it was such a foreign feeling because i grew up in minnesota where i could say whatever i want read whatever i want and write whatever i want without thinking anything of it and all of a sudden this freedom was taken away and i was always looking over my shoulder if its something you grew up with you dont think oh im so lucky because i can write whatever i want today or im so lucky because i can log onto whatever website i want today this isnt just about tibet this is about a sixth of the world that dont even know what theyre missing because state propaganda is just that good
3997062 they pounded and yelled at every single door until they got to mine they looked around the room and warned me if you do anything suspicious therell be consequences after they left i was shaking
3997063 i was chain smoking by this point the combination of the email the hotel raid and the tense atmosphere was emotionally draining i honestly dont know how people live in that kind of fear
3997064 its quite a steep climb and i went all the way to the rooftop from there you get a panoramic view of kardze these regions are really beautiful you can see the valley the distant grasslands and the snow capped mountains in the background that surround the town so i took pictures but i couldnt help myself i took a few zoomed in shots of the military base i didnt know that i was playing with fire
3997065 i thought this is it i cant believe i took those pictures
3997066 it was very intimidating i kept asking them whats wrong whats going on all they would say was wait and see i kept thinking wait and see for what
3997067 the first thing they did was look through the photos on my camera of course they found the shots of the military camp they started whispering to each other i said im sorry i take pictures of everything look at the photos of the mountains and the valleys and the houses but i knew i was in a lot of trouble
3997068 they flipped through my journal and filmed everything every sheet of paper that i had front and back i told them im going back to chengdu tomorrow morning look heres my bus ticket but they said were going to return your bus ticket and take you to kangding for further investigation apparently it wasnt in their jurisdiction to process my case where we were i kept telling them i need to call the us embassy but they very simply clarified you are a chinese citizen traveling in china on your chinese documents youll be prosecuted according to chinese law i didnt have any rights as an american at that point
3997069 china throws human rights activists into prison i remembered a documentary id seen in which one of chinas top lawyers said that he lost 99 of his cases dealing with human rights activists it takes months even years for people to even get a trial in china
3997070 id heard first hand testimonies for years from tibetan former political prisoners nuns getting electric cattle prods inserted into their vaginas people told to stand barefoot on blocks of ice and then pushed off an hour later so that the skin of their heels would peel off monks who have to use plastic cups because the electric shocks caused so much nerve damage to their fingers that they keep dropping glasses i never imagined that id be in a position where it was conceivable that id receive that kind of treatment
3997071 that hard drive contained photos of me speaking in front of tibetan flags me handing out tibetan flags me waving tibetan flags press releases that had my name under the header co founder of the raise tibetan flags campaign the whole raise tibetan flags campaign website that i put together from illustrator they could see everything ive been doing for the last few years
3997072 they saw my long face and that i wasnt eating
3997073 i was in the back seat in between two police officers a tibetan policewoman who kept regurgitating patriotic communist propaganda and the officer who had arrested me
3997074 all sorts of things kept drifting in and out of my head if they gave me 15 years id be 39 when i was released i wondered how many years it would take before id want to kill myself how would i do it id read about people killing themselves underneath their blankets and i wondered how they managed it it was the first time in my life that i actually thought about committing suicide
3997075 i meet these people in dharamsala all the time the hippies who smoke indian cigarettes and dont wear shoes because they love nature i decided that i was going to be tree hugging buddhist seeker wen i couldnt tell them the truth if i did i would be exposing a lot of people and i would be sending myself to prison
3997076 he was older than the others in his forties gray hair also not in uniform he was really nice to me but i got the feeling that he wasnt nice to everyone during the interrogation i became hippie wen when he asked me if id ever been to dharamsala i said oh yes i went to take the vipassana meditation course where for ten days i didnt speak to anyone at all and we werent even allowed to look anyone in the eyes this was all from stuff id heard from other people in all the years ive been coming to dharamsala ive never found the time to take a meditation course
3997077 i went into great detail about meditating in the indian himalayas how it really spoke to me and how spiritually developed i became
3997078 what do you think you would discover if you really looked into yourself and listened to your heart this made him laugh really loudly all communist officials are required to be atheist theyre not supposed to have any religion
3997079 ive never been good at lying or being put on the spot but i wasnt nervous at all if i needed more time to think about a question i would pick out specific chinese words and ask what does that mean again because they knew i grew up in the us and that my chinese isnt perfect or in my answer i would use an english word and say what is that in chinese when they asked me about the photographs i took i went into length about the magic of photography and composition and capturing the perfect subject i guess it was a pretty good performance because they seemed to believe me
3997080 i told them that i recently broke up with my boyfriend and it was just too hard to keep in contact with him so i decided to cancel my email account altogether
3997081 they told me well just take a quick look through your stuff again and then well send you back to your hotel in chengdu
3997082 i wanted them to feel guilty about putting me away i wanted to show them that im not a bad person and that i dont deserve to go to prison they gave me cigarettes and told me how much they envied me for being so young and having traveled all over the world they kept asking me questions about america what my parents were like things like that i asked them the same kinds of questions how old they were their kids names the female officer played me a britney spears song on her pink cell phone and had me guess which one it was i got it right it was oops i did it again we were all just hanging out laying on the bed or sitting in the recliner like we were on a road trip
3997083 four and a half hours later someone came in and said lets go
3997084 they actually looked worried as i was being swept away with these other officers i kept asking them you guys arent coming with me on the drive i kept asking questions to try to figure out what was going on i even straight up asked them can i relax am i really out of trouble you wouldnt lie to me would you all they would say is we were told to take to you to chengdu you know what you did wrong that wasnt very reassuring
3997085 i instantly perked up why would he ask me where my hotel was if he wasnt going to take me to it on august 1st last year 2007 i was driving on a bridge and it fell down it was the 35w bridge in minneapolis my car fell 60 feet landed upside down and 13 people died that was at 6 pm when i went to the impound lot the guy hugged me because hed been sure i was dead by the looks of my car and here i was at 6 pm august 1st 2008 facing another miracle escape after chinese police had found everything they needed to convict me everything that they put people away for they hadnt asked me a single question about it i couldnt comprehend it
3997086 i was thinking please just give me back my passport but i went to dinner with them even though i didnt have an appetite
3997087 the policeman came gave me back my hard drive and said goodbye it was good to meet you and i walked away
3997088 people do stand up for what they believe in and they die for it i didnt do that i told them what they wanted to hear to get out of the situation but would i have gained more insight in prison i dont know i lied about my involvement and what i believe in to take the easy way out ill never be proud of that
3997089 human rights in tibet have to begin with human rights in china its very unlikely that human rights in tibet are going to improve on their own since im ethnically chinese i feel like this is what i need to work on im not a superstitious person but part of me feels that ive been given more than just a chance to do this work and that this is now the purpose of my life

3997092 the whitebait spawn where grasses clump together and form a dense root mat where there is almost 100 percent humidity its not uncommon for different generations of fish to choose the same clump of grass for egg laying
3997093 the west coast famous for whitebait has seen massive dairying conversions in the last few years too frequently this has been to the detriment of the local environment as some farmers choose to put profit ahead of all else
3997094 the whitebait tradition is dear to most new zealanders as is the delicious whitebait fritter but this tradition is increasingly more difficult to secure as we experienced during last years meagre season

3997129 malaysiakini said it would reveal the identities of the commenters if it could however the cops raided and seized all their computers the only reason that may help in this case is to obtain correspondence between the commenter and rpk for example e mails as evidence for further investigation if not then the only thing rpk can give them is the internet protocol addresses and times which these addresses were logged onto his site the police can then cross reference this with the service provider for example tmnet to find out exactly which computer was logged on
3997130 this is akin to an invasion of privacy the complainant should point out specific comments for the court to decide if they are objectionable or would aid in an investigation

3997143 it would be rather difficult for gods people to trivialize the importance of living rightly on this earth moreover these commands if kept benefit more than just the obedient individual they are a blessing to everyone else also in addition the admonition for one to honor his or her father and mother does not in any way permit a person of any age to reduce his or her relationship with ones parents to something of insignificance this is of course a very special commandment insofar as the apostle paul points out in this is the first commandment with a promise

3997158 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow
3997159 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
3997160 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time
3997161 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
3997162 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye i just find it really disconcerting that people have to focus on the negative and that some people are sooooo bored with their own lives that they need to manifest lies to hurt another person
3997163 i tried to do the right things over and over and over
3997164 we havent canceled any shows its a full go starting on aug 23

3997182 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3997183 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3997184 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3997185 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3997186 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3997198 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3997199 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3997200 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3997201 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3997202 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3997203 you see unlike toronto buffalo sees itself as a player on the world stage not via commerce or education or culture but through its sports teams and with all due respect to the sabres the bills are the father son and motherlode in terms of our sense of self
3997204 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3997205 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3997214 ah bobo you appear to have some matter gnawing intensely on your mind today eh so what is it that is making you look so glum if i may ask
3997215 there is too much of this new technology buzz going on doc
3997216 and i feel that it is all happening too quickly for me to wrap my hands around
3997217 relax bobo it is not as if we are unused to the buzzing by now so what noise are we agitated about
3997218 the endless sound of web 2 0 buzz and it seems like history repeating itself from the late 1990s when everybody in every business was scrambling for an internet strategy a web presence and an online initiative that would work 24 by 7 by 365 if you do not have your company on the web you are extinct said the prophets echoing the underlying sentiment it seems that these same crystal ball gazers are back in business these days
3997219 ah so we have a new paradigm that looks suspiciously like the old paradigm with a raincoat
3997220 well nobody knows for sure if it is paradigm or a parachute looking back on the old days i think it was much simpler to just get on the web and be online with an unfussy site compared to making a company web 2 0 ready
3997221 because according to the paradigm gurus this involves comprehending a nebulous idea called enterprise 2
3997222 is there a simple definition of this web 2 0
3997223 well doc despite thousands of blog pages devoted to web 2 0 i think the simplest definition comes from a popular news magazine which is good at bringing the hype to the masses and they simply re christened web 2 0 as the live web to make it comprehensible to the average non techie
3997224 ah that is good for guys like me who find version numbers incomprehensible personally i am appalled by web 2 0 as a term but live web now that is appealing i will be using that in future
3997225 well doc so the live web conveys no doubt that all along the web has not been a live thing
3997226 thats right what makes the new web come alive is quite simply all of us as social animals we participate in this paradigm most often at broadband speed and we are present constantly thanks to our activity the live web has replaced telephones and it is perhaps in the process of replacing television as well it is like an open club with all kinds of wise and entertaining people sitting around in lounges ready to chat with you except that this club is spread all over the planet
3997227 i see what you mean it is now the place i go to for googling answers to any questions that trouble me and i get these almost instantly i cannot imagine my parents coming even come close to matching that when i used to badger them with questions as a kid
3997228 quite so bobo the live web brings you the distilled wisdom of many it is the harnessing of collective intelligence sounds lofty i know but it is actually happening all the time here every time you type in a search query on google you launch a worldwide club operation to see which other sites people on the web have considered to be relevant to that term amazingly it gives you a nifty report that no amount of hands on work by an army of jeeves clones could have managed
3997229 it seems that we have many hands making light work for everyone
3997230 thats true my boy it is evident the live web is congenial to the wisdom of crowds according to the journalist james surowiecki author of the book the wisdom of crowds why the many are smarter than the few and how collective wisdom shapes business economies societies and nations your average gang of people can estimate the weight of a printer or predict a sporting events outcome better than an expert can so hundreds of bloggers can be an alternative to even the finest journalists and that if millions of eyes monitor and edit entries anyone can write and rewrite a wikipedia that can rival the encyclopedia britannica
3997231 it gives us freedom as well doc maybe too much of it
3997232 look at the bright side you no longer have to be a passive consumer you need not just order pre designed music from a shelf you can find entertainment sites here where you can make your own music videos you need not be a passive news consumer waiting for your edited daily tabloid to arrive you can voice your opinion and send it all over the world on your personal media at any time as many times as you want as we keep shifting our activities to the live web and keep adding previously unthinkable new pursuits where we shape what we want maybe it would be right to say that our everyday existence would become like the weaving of a network quilt that each of us can fashion to our personal taste it is the ultimate do it yourself club
3997233 i am sure all this interactivity has made some splendid opportunities for smart nimble new companies doc but it shakes me up after all bazooka is a traditional old business and i have just about got used to having internet access all the time we are still dealing with the nuts and bolts of being an enterprise 1 0 company
3997234 ah this is where reality meets the hype my boy the live web is after all the wild untamed internet space which is so different from your corporate space nobody says that you have to replicate the entire club 2 0 inside bazooka that would be a surefire recipe for chaos like they say the devil is in the details
3997235 well even the rampant live web has rules wikipedia has a very robust list of controls and layers of user participation it has evolved from years of review moderation editing and approvals it is not just a seething mass of thousands of people mass collaborating to create the perfect knowledge base so even if you feel pushed by the gung ho supporters of the live web who say they have moved on and left you behind you have no reason to despair people do want to share they want collaboration full time they want all that kind of stuff and you can roll it in one step at a time after all the live web is going to be around and kicking for a long long time

3997260 there is inadequate monitoring of media and its role to provide balanced reporting and equity in coverage complaints to the media by candidates or parties who may be disaffected can lead to further imbalance in reporting there is need for an independent monitoring body to assess and to report on the balance of the media during the lead up to elections
3997261 i dont think that this is bad news at all actually the fact weve got 350 000 more jobs than we had when we were elected 1999 to lead the government should be very good news for new zealand

3997295 its a natural progression when borrowers are not able to get current banks have no choice but to foreclose
3997296 we may see a few more quarters of this before banks are able to work through it all
3997297 it doesnt really surprise us that they are still going up
3997298 they are such a lagging indicator they are indicating a homeowner or an investor who had a problem 60 90 or 120 days ago just because the foreclosure process takes so long

3997320 this guy had no clue too many motorists and law enforcement officers are totally ignorant of the law
3997321 and if the lane is less than 14 feet wide or if its just not safe to share the lane
3997322 the cyclist can claim the lane this is the safe way to ride it tells the motorist hes going to have to cross the yellow line to go around you
3997323 its been my experience that some rural areas arent real fond of us little people in lycra
3997324 they dont hesitate to pull around a slow moving tractor and smile and wave at the driver but cyclists arent treated with the same courtesy
3997325 in my situation the promoter paid for the right to use that road everybody should have been made aware we were out there competing
3997326 the basic problem is this misperception by some motorists that we dont have a right to be on the road with them
3997327 one of my friends nearly got into a fistfight with a guy who screamed at him why dont you just ride on the sidewalk well as a matter of fact you cant its against the law
3997328 oilexco had a very good first half of 2008 achieving record financial results and continuing our strong track record with the drill bit in particular the company had another major exploration success at moth our second in a year following the huntington discovery in 2007 we are set for an active second half with seven appraisal and production wells due to be drilled and the shelley development due to come onstream we will also be progressing activities on our key 2009 development projects
3997329 since april frontera has been working to return to drilling operations as soon as possible at the c prospect but has encountered delays associated with obtaining the required drilling equipment in the current oil price environment during the delay however we have taken the opportunity to enhance our ongoing work by reprocessing our 3d seismic survey over the prospect this work will incorporate the actual results encountered from the well bores that have been drilled to date and provide the basis for continuation of drilling operations at the lloyd 1 location in addition reprocessing will yield a more accurate view of the subsurface for future drilling operations that will be designed to appraise the results obtained from our work at the c prospect thus far we remain extremely encouraged by our ongoing work at this important prospect

3997332 people in oklahoma are unsatisfied unless youve won a national championship
3997333 weve won two big 12 championships in a row and nobody else has done that
3997334 i think some people see it as if oklahoma won this but theres always a but in there and that leaves a bitter taste in your mouth
3997335 think about oklahoma and what hes done and what hes accomplished
3997336 anyone who questions him will be really disappointed when he leaves because its going to be hard to follow him
3997337 i just think we were a little bit more hungry than what they were
3997338 theyre tough to meet but we wouldnt want it any other way we wouldnt want people to be like oh well be ok if you guys are 8 4 thats not what we want
3997339 we dont want people to be satisfied we dont want to be satisfied
3997340 catch the train to melbourne and go see cheap foreign movies at the nova on monday
3997341 you should go running you know how it makes you less moody
3997342 education is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity
3997343 were constantly vigilant about who is coming into our office
3997344 but we dont want to be a closed off office
3997345 but obviously when a human situation like this occurs its not any longer about parties
3997346 a perfect summer day is when the sun is shining the breeze is blowing the birds are singing and the lawn mower is broken
3997347 el pobre ah tirado y llegan antes a taparle para que no se le vea que un m dico con un chute de morfina

3997351 der schlechte start anfang der zweiten halbzeit hat uns das spiel gekostet
3997352 educations purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open one
3997353 we will sell the metal to a scrapyard and use the money to buy food for us and our children
3997354 i was very scared the only thing that went through my mind was my childrens safety i grabbed them and ran as fast as i could when i saw the flames
3997355 the practice of providing exam results and timetable details is not considered private since it is accepted practice to publish this kind of information on notice boards
3997356 if students have privacy concerns about information being so accessible it is their legal right to submit a take down notice
3997357 the fire started shortly after 8 30pm on tuesday and 15 minutes later everything was burnt down
3997358 but on tuesday night it flared up all over again and it was fanned by the strong wind which was blowing heavily
3997359 there was smoke all over it was dark and very dangerous we were unable to remove anything from the guest rondavels
3997360 we fought hard to keep the fire away from coming close to our guests
3997361 its such a pity to see this place in ashes like this we had furniture in those rooms but now it looks like a football pitch
3997362 the situation is worsened by the fact that the wind is blowing strongly
3997363 we have not received any reports of big animals being hurt but we suspects smaller ones might have been trapped in the fire
3997364 we are still warning motorists to be careful as the visibility is still very bad
3997365 there are thick bushes next to the road and when that catches fire it causes a lot of smoke
3997366 after the fire is put out we will start determining the damage in the area once that is done we will look at a way forward
3997367 this further vindicates what we have been saying all along he killed those young women
3997368 a number of stadiums are reflecting there are going to be some cost over runs
3997369 national fiscus will have to make a contribution host cities will have to make a contribution and we have to involve institutions such as the dbsa
3997370 we would like to thank the community for their response with information
3997371 how can the anc talk about service delivery and then walk out before we can discuss such a job creation opportunity there is nothing we can do as they left us without a quorum
3997372 it doesnt matter if the da was correct or not in ousting petrus as mayor
3997373 if we allow him to return we will lose our credibility in george
3997374 the anc regards this as intimidation as we are blamed as the cause for poor service delivery
3997375 they want to see george put under administration which would be run by the anc for the duration
3997376 however the id is also using this opportunity to try and push the da into accepting an agreement which would benefit its position in the council alliance
3997377 its a very tough race and thats why there are no elimination heats
3997378 he was crying he was crying like a person who is crying inside
3997379 i thought the woman was desperate that the man be killed because she asked me repeatedly to do it
3997380 i did not know where the bullet hit the deceased and if he was dead or alive
3997381 i was frustrated because i did not go there with the intention that anyone should be killed
3997382 the docket said the case had been provisionally withdrawn pending the blood results
3997383 yes there was a summons issued whereby he was due to appear yesterday
3997384 this is obviously just a miscommunication between the police and the courts
3997385 we check their operating times and whether they allow children in illegal taverns are shut down
3997386 more than any other feature in port elizabeth the baakens valley has huge potential to be our world class landmark like central park in new york or the ramblas a long tree lined pedestrian mall in barcelona or cape towns table mountain
3997387 to fulfil this potential the natural environment has to be protected from ad hoc developments the wonderful possibilities around re connecting the harbour to the river can then be explored
3997388 if we allow private commercial ad hoc development which is not in the publics interest to go ahead in time we will be left with huge regret that we have raped our valley
3997389 the 12 correctional centres visited by the ag across the country were all found to be in violation of the standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners as approved by the united nations
3997390 these centres were found not to have proper maintenance plans leading to a virtual collapse in the structure and buildings
3997391 many correctional centres have failed to maintain their boilers properly on one occasion a boiler exploded causing the death of two staff members and injuring many others failure to maintain boilers is a contravention of the occupational health and safety act these centres were found not to have fire fighting equipment risking the lives of staff and inmates in the event of a fire
3997392 at several centres security fences were not properly maintained and several security cameras and doors were out of order
3997393 practitioners are reminded annually of the amount they are required to pay as well as the due date
3997394 we realise that the penalty fees prescribed in the act are high and have allowed practitioners three months in which to settle their accounts
3997395 some of our practitioners are unemployed or are not currently practising which is why there is a provision in the act to apply for voluntary erasure to avoid paying the hefty penalty fees in such circumstances
3997396 we need to get 32 cpd continuous professional development points a year to be able to continue to work as practitioners we get those from the hpcsa
3997397 the aa has conducted numerous research projects into effects of alcohol on driving and has proven drivers are significantly impaired at the 0 05 limit he added
3997398 the aa fully agrees with the 0 02 percent limit for professional drivers
3997399 this allows some leeway for medications which contain alcohol but still emphasises that one alcoholic drink puts you over the limit
3997400 there are churches schools teachers and elderly people of all races who believe building the supermarket is the right thing to do
3997401 at present these people have to do their shopping in oudtshoorn at great cost transport to oudtshoorn costs r100 and i am sure they will be most happy that the construction can continue
3997402 people tend to confuse low cost housing with affordable housing low cost housing is what you see in kwanokuthula i can assure you there is no intention of building low cost housing in the upmarket suburbs of plettenberg bay
3997403 the growth of the local economy has highlighted a shortage of affordable housing for middle income earners in professional careers
3997404 we are seeking to address this problem by selling land to help fund the construction of affordable housing
3997405 should be reminded of his mandate and that it is time to see the coachs initial thinking being realised on the field
3997406 it was ricky who helped make history in the house of pain
3997407 personally i think ricky has proved himself as south africas leading scrumhalf is it fouries world cup status that now elevates him above ricky in my view fourie has done nothing to justify a place in the starting lineup
3997408 conrad jantjes is on present form the no1 fullback it is worrying that people make decisions with their heart to give someone montgomery his 100th test cap
3997409 i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
3997410 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby that peter has spoken of it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands
3997411 is the team that has been selected of such a nature that it will ensure the support of most south africans
3997412 we cannot repeat the cycle of the white era we must build for 2011 it is easy to fall into a comfort zone peter should be reminded of his mandate its not all about transformation but it transformation is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year
3997413 victims of trafficking will not be prosecuted for immigration violations and prostitution
3997414 the project is structured by a co operation agreement signed by the national provincial and local governments in february 2006 in response to an earlier visit to the area by the housing minister to view the alarming circumstances under which the residents were living in
3997415 as part of our continuous effort to curb the proliferation of illegal firearms and to reduce firearms related violence in our country nearly 25000 firearms have been destroyed by the saps in the eastern cape since 2004
3997416 although everything is so small and confined i like the fact that i can work both at sea and on land
3997417 there was a recruitment drive at school and those of us who were interested were given application forms
3997418 my job keeps me busy and that is what i enjoy about it
3997419 i moved to addo in 1997 i love living here and despite the poverty the aids pandemic and unemployment life here is beautiful
3997420 there is a lot that needs to be done here to alleviate poverty aids is shattering a lot of families causing many dysfunctional families in this town
3997421 i think more education and awareness programmes should be initiated to educate the infected and affected on how to control aids
3997422 bed and breakfast establishments are taking part in projects that alleviate poverty programmes like soup kitchens and providing employment for the locals i think people are becoming aware of the need to help each other
3997423 this school is wonderful the teachers are open and willing to try new things we specifically worked with teachers to teach them how to help learners learn to read and write
3997424 it is frustrating not to have enough money to support people
3997425 we lived five minutes away from school and we loved our stay because we were taken good care of
3997426 they kept us busy with visits to the elephant park playing with the kids and holding singing concerts for us at least once a week
3997427 the teachers were so eager to learn about computers so much so we had to have classes during the lunch hour
3997428 the teachers here wanted to be the best teachers i think that is why they were eager to learn
3997429 back home we want people to have insight about south african communities the people of this country have a sense of community the family unit plays a huge part in their society
3997430 i feel that we are the luckiest people to have had this opportunity people and the children here have a great respect for others and each other while people might see poverty poor students and all the other negative things we saw the richness of life and we were happy to be part of it
3997431 we are now at 291 and it does not look like the number is dropping
3997432 our decision to support the hospitals initiative is in line with our ongoing support of efforts to increase paraffin education and awareness
3997433 most pupils believe mathematics is a very boring subject and we want to change that perception
3997434 i feel the organisers didnt do their job we came hear hoping to sell our merchandise and yet there are no customers
3997435 we dont usually come to small exhibitions but since we had a fashion show in johannesburg and the organisers invited us to attend this exhibition in port elizabeth we came
3997436 i dont think people are aware of the exhibition it cost me a lot of money to fly my merchandise here the money i paid for customs will not be returned and i havent sold anything since the exhibition started
3997437 i think people would have found it interesting to experience the different cultures i think nothing much has been done to inform people of this exhibition
3997438 i have been to pe before and have received support as i have a western dish stall we are losing a lot of money we prepare food every day and there is no one to buy the food we are not making any money i dont think i will come to pe to participate in this exhibition again next year
3997439 i sell eastern food and the chef is from pakistan we have done many exhibitions in south africa and were quite surprised people didnt attend this one we are losing a lot of money
3997440 i have heard rumours that the exhibitioners want to boycott the exhibition due to people not attending i have done everything in my power to advertise the exhibition and i did my research that the venue was the proper place to hold an exhibition
3997441 after having facilitated a workshop on adaptation strategies how to teach the learner and how to respond to their problems and their needs this week im busy with class visits to check whether teachers are able to implement the strategies

3997459 its the first bright news for traders in the oil market in a while
3997460 the dramatic drop off in commodities and specifically oil has been well overdone in my view
3997461 they still think the u s is the epicenter of the world economy
3997462 the u s is still very important but as far as commodity demand is concerned the u s isnt the main game in town china is the biggest consumer and increasingly india
3997463 i am proud to stand beside a president of georgia who has shown such spirit determination and leadership in the cause of freedom
3997464 18 months ago georgians returned to this square to complete the task you began in 1989
3997465 you gathered here armed with nothing but roses and the power of your convictions and you claimed your liberty
3997466 and because you acted georgia is today both sovereign and free and a beacon of liberty for this region and the world
3997467 you are building a free future for your children and grandchildren and you are helping other nations to do the same
3997468 and last year and last year when terrorist violence in iraq was escalating georgia showed her courage you increased your troop commitment in iraq fivefold the iraqi people are grateful and so are your american and coalition allies
3997469 bla bla bla not a word about how just maybe georgia should apologize for attacking south ossetia
3997470 early this morning russia convened an emergency session of the un security council calling on both sides to immediately cease hostilities return to the negotiating table and renounce the use of force but the last part about renouncing the use of force is exactly what georgias president mikhail saakashvili refuses to do
3997471 last year even bush was denouncing the violent attack on his own people during a peaceful opposition protest in georgias capital as well as shutting down the opposition media and exiling of political opponents
3997472 scheunemann a bearded pear faced gun geek who looks like what might have happened to a gi joe doll if it had spent years stuffing its face at pricey restaurants while power schmoozing politicians and petty dictators also worked for recently disgraced bush fundraiser stephen payne lobbying for his caspian alliance oil business
3997473 the invasion was backed up by a pr offensive so layered and sophisticated that i even got an hysterical call today from a hedge fund manager in new york screaming about an
3997474 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
3997475 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia
3997476 georgian president mikhail saakashvili was taking his own appeal directly to the american people the georgian leader made appearances on morning network and cable news shows
3997477 good morning ive just met with my national security team to discuss the crisis in georgia ive spoken with president saakashvili of georgia and president sarkozy of france this morning
3997478 the united states strongly supports frances efforts as president of the european union to broker an agreement that will end this conflict
3997479 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and agreed to a provisional cease fire
3997480 all forces including russian forces have an obligation to protect innocent civilians from attack
3997481 with these concerns in mind i have directed a series of steps to demonstrate our solidarity with the georgian people and bring about a peaceful resolution to this conflict im sending secretary of state condoleezza rice to france where she will confer with president sarkozy she will then travel to tbilisi where she will personally convey americas unwavering support for georgias democratic government on this trip she will continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
3997482 ive also directed secretary of defense bob gates to begin a humanitarian mission to the people of georgia headed by the united states military this mission will be vigorous and ongoing a u s c 17 aircraft with humanitarian supplies is on its way and in the days ahead we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3997483 as i have made clear russias ongoing action raise serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3997484 president of the russian federation dmitry medvedev has declared august 13 a day of mourning for the humanitarian disaster in south ossetia the president signed a decree on declaring a day of mourning for the humanitarian disaster in south ossetia georgian forces in violation of the peace agreements in place in the georgian ossetian conflict zone and the un charter and with the sanction of the georgian leadership illegally invaded and attempted to seize south ossetian territory on august 8 2008 using aviation heavy artillery and guns and killing the local population this act constitutes genocide against the south ossetian people the city of tskhinvali and other towns have been practically destroyed creating a humanitarian disaster in south ossetia furthermore an armed attack was launched against a russian armed forces contingent stationed in the region in accordance with international agreements for normalising the situation in the georgian ossetian conflict zone which constitutes an act of aggression under the terms of the un general assemblys resolution of december 14 1974

3997498 developers have taken a wait and see approach to vista
3997499 the new operating system has had more than its share of problems and the desire to move from xp on the windows platform is still lagging that coupled with interest in alternative operating systems is suppressing development activity and that in turn will further erode vistas acceptance
3997500 this is just a shock to anyone who knew him

3997513 but we are facing a very tight fiscal 2010 budget
3997514 theres a pretty healthy contingent of young girl riders and younger guys as well this might inspire them to shoot for the moon
3997515 if nothing else it sort of enhances the image boise has as a great bike community
3997516 one of the strongest growing markets is womens cycling undoubtedly this will raise awareness and get women in the valley excited
3997517 boise whether its cycling or boise state football they take ownership of the team or the girl or whatever
3997518 people of boise are going to grab onto that as one of their own
3997519 her example is a great one all the way around cycling doesnt always have to be competitive
3997520 everyone can be inspired by what she has achieved and i hope that it does increase participation
3997521 to have someone like kristin armstrong whos very positive very strong in cycling and very visible will enhance participation
3997522 just to see kids getting out there and being active is great
3997523 i love to give back to the community and meet the kids i want to be a role model for aspiring athletes

3997535 he gets a lot of attention and im just so grateful
3997536 life is life and love is love both even when they are at their lowest divets in the rollercoaster are worth every second
3997537 oh shit i need gas before i get paid tips

3997539 life is life and love is love both even when they are at their lowest divets in the rollercoaster are worth every second
3997540 it is true to say we have something of a revolving door situation for example 1 squadron has barely been back from iraq for 12 months and they are already returning to conflict this time in afghanistan
3997541 a lot of our men are accumulating a huge amount of operational experience in very challenging circumstances
3997542 but if you ask any service man or woman what the worst part of their job is theyll say its the boredom when theyre not active they are doing what they joined up for and are glad to be doing their bit
3997543 however it inevitably places a strain on both them and their family and while they are away it is important that we play an almost parental role to make sure their loved ones have the support they need
3997544 the hardest part will be adapting to the climate and the terrain
3997545 but also we have a role to play in winning the hearts and minds of locals and that brings with it certain cultural sensitivities
3997546 flagship housing group has withdrawn its planning application as the site has been identified as a high flood risk increasing the height of the development to address this issue would reduce the number of homes built with the restrictions being so severe we think it would preclude us from making the development financially viable there is an acute need for affordable housing in aldeburgh so we are working in close partnership with suffolk coastal district council to remedy this situation we are looking at alternative sites and when progress has been made we will report to the town council
3997547 i reckon we only have a day now until thursday we will have to go and look for temporary accommodation we are going to have to squat somewhere else
3997548 broad oak house and garden had always been a very loved home and very well maintained my mother continued to live there until her death during 1993 it had been our family home for nearly 60 years
3997549 the whole family including several grandchildren have wonderful memories of times enjoyed in both the house and games played in the lovely garden
3997550 with broad oak being up for sale the house would have been secured therefore in my view the squatters have absolutely no rights to be there at all
3997551 i look forward to hearing of a happier end to this matter in the immediate future as i am sure do the inhabitants of the village of great finborough
3997552 as far as we are aware the eviction has not yet taken place and we will attend if we need to
3997553 negotiations are necessary to hold in such a situation peace ways to regulate the conflict stands as a priority

3997555 my object in living is to unite my avocation and my vocation as my two eyes make one in sight only where love and need are one ive toyed with quitting and just taking a year or two off to travel the world and explore its something ive always wanted to do and can afford to do financially but the practical side of me says its a foolish thing to consider you dont have to quit your job and explore the whole world at once plan two week vacations and select a small part of the world you want to see tuscany and florence london and outskirts paris and amsterdam etc put your practical and systematic qualities to good use planning your experiences if you could get away for a few days every 6 months youd have something to look forward to and something to talk about plus youd be absorbing new information about the world and about yourself does your alma mater have an alumni travel program that would be a way to meet people and learn new things you might have a botanist guiding you through the amazon or an art history prof leading you through the louvre good stuff you do get vacation leave dont you i just got a big raise and my feeling is complete and utter ambivalence i didnt ask for it or lobby for it i just got it and shrugged my shoulders i guess its nice but i dont really need the extra money i already make plenty well you must be bringing value to the company or they wouldnt have given you an unsolicited big raise companies cant run without good accountants sounds like you under estimate your own value and the value of the accounting profession if you no longer like the activity of accounting see a career counselor if you like accounting but dont like your work environment figure out what you dont like and seek to change those aspects or move on i can think of plenty of things to do with your money aside from travel my avocation and my vocation as my two eyes make one in sight only where love and need are one and the work is play for mortal stakes is the deed ever really done for heaven and the futures sakes

3997559 mccain has a good record on that issue abortion and he must show that he will continue it as president
3997560 for mccain the aim will be to solidify evangelicals as a key constituency
3997561 for obama it is significant that he will be participating as an equal on the same stage as mccain in an this signals the shift in the evangelical political landscape since 2004
3997562 this has a lot less to do with what is going on in california and more to do with what is going on in ohio pennsylvania and florida the
3997563 in all of these states there is a sizable evangelical population that does not directly identify with the old religious right
3997564 the pmc had given priority to the road development work for the cyg and is nearing completion in most stretches except for baner road
3997565 the baner road development will go on till september end as the laying of pipelines for water supply and drainage and ducts for utility service is still going on
3997566 the work is causing inconvenience to the public but the civic administration too has to complete the road construction work

3997575 reports that edmonds attributes his new success as a post concussion syndrome la russa regular to the following
3997576 i dont know whats changed theres a lot of things going through the stuff with the concussion and my legs and no spring training and trying adapt to a bigger ballpark than st louis in san diego coming here and being in more familiar surroundings has allowed me to go out and be myself and things are better again

3997579 the chinese themselves are very very keen to join the world community
3997580 at the same time the world community also has more responsibility to bring china in the mainstream of world democracy
3997581 we hope france can work together with china to rule out any disruptions to enhance our mutual trust and to maintain the momentum of development of bilateral relations
3997582 as always he is holding his cards close and waiting for more information
3997583 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
3997584 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
3997585 i have voted for members of both parties in the course of my adult life and as i said earlier i will vote for the candidate i think can do the best job for america whether that candidate is a republican a democrat or an independent
3997586 he has energized a lot of people around the world and so i think he is worth listening to and seeing what he stands for
3997587 he likes and admires john mccain and that would be a factor in anything he does if he decides to get more involved
3997588 and likes him and is looking for a reason to vote for him he hasnt found it yet
3997589 i will ultimately vote for the person i believe brings to the american people the kind of vision the american people want to see for the next four years
3997590 a vision that reaches out to the rest of the world that starts to restore confidence in america that starts to restore favorable ratings to america frankly weve lost a lot in recent years
3997591 signal that choice sends about the character and judgment of the candidate
3997592 its time for thecall to expand to the national stage in a historic gathering in our nations capital this saturday
3997593 a solemn assembly a gathering of all ages races and denominations the 12 hours of thecall are spent primarily before the lord in prayer and worship
3997594 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
3997595 our country faces very grave economic military and foreign policy challenges and many americans of all political parties will vote for a change in november barack obama is the only candidate who offers that change of direction we need
3997596 i know hell say what he really thinks maybe it wont be what people want to hear but it will be the truth
3997597 ability to be an effective leader for our country and to grow and strengthen the republican party when he is elected president of the united states
3997598 and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise
3997599 in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone ive spent more time with sen mccain he did my tv show than i have with sen obama
3997600 i would hope that my friend john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics although i support sen obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me
3997601 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
3997602 to somehow suggest obama is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in montana running for president is absurd
3997603 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight
3997604 i can tell you that recent developments between russia and georgia give us no proof that dmitry medvedev is an independent leader
3997605 one scene was very clear when putin began to tell the president what to do it was not a private conversation putin wanted to show that he was in charge
3997606 no one thought about a session of duma no one even bothered
3997607 existing carpal tunnel condition for which she has had previous surgeries
3997608 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
3997609 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3997610 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3997611 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3997612 as we move forward the united states and europe must review our multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia in light of its actions
3997613 im interested in good relations between the united states and russia
3997614 but in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations
3997615 that is a much smaller group than you might think
3997616 this would mark the first time in more than two decades that the born again vote has swung toward the democratic candidate
3997617 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3997618 this is an important signal the u s will keep georgian airport and seaports open
3997619 the first plane landed and thats a turning point this is an operation led by the pentagon
3997620 they are there to neutralize a huge arsenal of arms and military hardware which they found there totally abandoned it was necessary to neutralize them in order not to create a threat for civilians
3997621 numerous houses in the villages of kekhvi nizhnie achaveti verkhnie achaveti and tamarasheni had been burnt down over the last day
3997622 saw the smoldering remnants of the houses and household items the villages were virtually deserted with the exception of a few elderly and incapacitated people who stayed behind either because they were unable to flee or because they were trying to save their belongings and cattle
3997623 when we challenged them on this the russians told us that they dont control everything yet
3997624 you have the right to freedom and independence we are here to demonstrate our solidarity
3997625 we did not want the war we did not want to kill ossetian people
3997626 to stop the war now we pray for the eu to help us
3997627 i doubt peace making can be agreed upon on one day maybe it is too early to celebrate yet
3997628 ethnic conflicts in this part of the caucuses have lasted for centuries it is a very controversial and fragile issue everybody should handle it carefully
3997629 the most important goal for all of us here is to establish peace and stop the disaster
3997630 these are russian tanks outside of gori shooting at our military bases

3997634 i saw an angel close by me not large but small of stature and most beautiful her face burning as if she were one of the highest angels who seem to be all of fire they must be those whom we call seraphim
3997635 you dont see that very often where theres some walks and a lot of hit batters but i think at that point in the game we definitely would take it
3997636 that was big for us because i think zito was doing real well today he was changing speeds and doing great we kind of got in the way of some balls
3997637 at the time i didnt really feel like it was that crazy
3997638 now looking back on it when you think about it it does seem a little odd i didnt realize we had three hit batsmen
3997639 we scored a bunch of runs and didnt hardly have any hits
3997640 what was that wmd or wme i cant speak understandable english so the first place they put me at was the phone
3997641 it is more likely that i will start at shortstop for the yankees
3997642 its a data machine and ultimately could become a video machine
3997643 to get on that device to get on something that people are used to looking at quite a bit even more than their phone that will be a real shot in the arm for our wireless strategy
3997644 so we wish we had a better working relationship with sling we share a different view of the legality of what they are encouraging it is a lawsuit where the loser is the customer in our view that is not a winning strategy
3997645 if we have a 24 hour cable channel we may want to change it up a little bit

3997649 was observed to raise the weapon and point it at the deputy
3997650 we are still very surprised ourselves at all of this
3997651 we shoot center mass in the largest part of your body and the largest part of your torso
3997652 we are not shooting to wound or kill we are shooting to stop the actions of the armed suspect
3997653 we didnt know anything until we saw the street getting blocked off
3997654 and we had no idea there was an elderly man there
3997655 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
3997656 the redux about two maniacs living with their mother and the three women who tread onto this deviant familys property is currently in the scripting stage with p2 s franck khalfoun apparently ratner is a huge fan of the original film
3997657 we were hired about a month ago for a two week production polish i wouldnt even classify it as a rewrite we were simply brought in to help out on a few plot points and character details nothing big those two weeks have come and gone and now the the project is barreling towards production at the end of september alex and greg have a great vision for this and it should be a wild wild ride
3997658 that means that youll sync less and get the data you care about faster than before this will be a plus for everyone but will especially benefit edge users and those with spotty connections
3997659 were just seeing enormous traffic record levels that weve frankly never seen before
3997660 there isnt an event like the olympics in terms of offering viewer choice and we know from previous games that nothing drives red button usage the way the olympics does in 2004 the first interactive olympics we did we had more than 10 million people go interactive just on the satellite platform thats more than double the next most popular event the bbcs ever done wimbledon with about four million more than anything we can do whether its glastonbury or another sports event the olympics gets people looking on interactive tv
3997661 we are not a commercial organisation nbc are that may be why theyve chosen to hold back some of their content from the web for us its all about universal access we want universal reach were not about making money we just want more and more people to access the games in however many ways they want to there arent any limitations for us im sure they have very different considerations
3997662 the ioc are among the most stringent in sports rights when it comes to digital platforms and we have a very strict arrangement with them that our content must not leak outside the uk
3997663 thats really for the ioc thats their role to monitor and see what happens
3997664 these games are slightly antisocial happening when most people in the country are either in bed or in work the opportunities for people to just sit in front of the telly all day waiting for the action arent as obvious as athens when it was a european timezone they need to get a fix of the action wherever they are that means we need to offer them a really strong on demand service and make sure we make the live action available wherever they are
3997665 when it comes to sport the real appeal is with the bbc sport website
3997666 weve had discussions with all the mobile operators it hasnt been possible to work with all of them on it largely for technical reasons in terms of challenges thats been an interesting one
3997667 this particular platform is more about how it develops in the future we dont see it as a mature service beijing is an end in itself but its also a stepping stone for london we want to try things out see how they work to learn for four years time
3997668 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances

3997670 gold looks rangebound but the bias is on the upside
3997671 this is an important potential cure it is possible one injection could switch off the abnormal immune response if it works it could reverse the disease and stop further episodes
3997672 based on previous laboratory research we would expect that this will specifically suppress or down regulate the auto immune response
3997673 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings
3997674 its like an egg toss if you move your hand backward as you catch the egg and increase the time of contact over which the impact occurs the impact will be less forceful and the egg will not break it is the same phenomenon experienced in catching a baseball

3997678 its terribly sad but another example of how communication or a lack of communication can get in the way
3997679 when i heard about it i was really unhappy and distressed now i understand how it happened anger is counter productive
3997680 i dont want to off side the ranger and the council i dont want to make enemies of these people there is no point shit happens sometimes weve all been there
3997681 it was taken down by graffiti removal people its not their brief to make sure they are careful they were just doing their job
3997682 those designers who have the stomach to go again will do theirs again i assume they may not go back because its very labour intensive
3997683 i was annoyed and frustrated because it was a joy to see this work in the street at it was terrible the way these designers were treated

3997704 we want someone who is a strong advocate for our positions and not a candidate for the best supporting actor award who is being what somebody wants him to be
3997705 supporting legislation that helps grow the economy and creates new jobs for hardworking americans
3997706 the chamber is grateful for nicks commitment to these important issues
3997707 because they recognize i am focused on making sure american families can be successful through lower taxes expanded energy production and new health care options to cover millions of uninsured small business employees
3997708 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3997709 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3997710 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3997711 so i could walk far enough to get to the foot doctor
3997712 do you think im going to be able to walk into another drugstore and have somebody do that to me
3997713 i already went over and introduced myself to the head pharmacist at the cvs where morris will be
3997714 i told him he really needs to pay special attention to the people from avalon
3997715 its especially hard to compete when you dont have a niche
3997716 this is the best business ive ever had to deal with
3997717 i have bills home phone number he would open the place for me
3997718 he takes care of people you wish your doctor were that caring
3997719 what made avalon drug special was that you developed a personal relationship with the druggist
3997720 i had the hottest after school job in river oaks delivering for avalon drug
3997721 i remember sunbathing on the roof waiting for more deliveries

3997723 brings us one step closer to defining identifying and stopping fraudulent and deceptive conduct in wholesale petroleum markets that may contribute to higher gasoline prices
3997724 todays out of control petroleum markets cant be explained by normal market fundamentals and i hope that aggressive action by the federal trade commission can burst the energy price bubble that is burdening american families and dragging down our economy

3997733 i dont really see it having a major impact on our business
3997734 what theyve done via hedging programs is lock in a profitable price
3997735 they never probably envisioned prices would go as high as they went and as prices come down youll see some of that turn around
3997736 a lot of their losses stem from changes in the market in future periods that change the expected future value of those hedges
3997737 those are big numbers for them but a fair amount of that loss came from changes in value in future periods that may or may not come to pass
3997738 say theres a chance oil could go to 500 a barrel ill forgo that upside to lock in that 40 margin that is the basic concept of hedging im eliminating risk

3997763 if we didnt get the military commission up and running and get the public behind it it would implode cases like khadrs were going to bring political support and make it harder for the next commander in chief to stop the process

3997773 se equivoc javier guti rrez trevi o dirigente de los industriales cuando dijo que si no voy a controversia sacan su dinero a jalisco donde est su amor al estado y su deseo de generar empleo a los jaliscienses
3997774 no estamos diciendo que ese dinero vaya a ser utilizado para los partidos pol ticos en su beneficio personal lo que sostengo es que se puede buscar un bien legitimo para el estado que es la consolidaci n de la vida democr tica a trav s de los partidos y tanto recurso conlleva un gran riesgo que es la descomposici n de los partidos al tener en su interior dinero mucho dinero

3997777 the bessie smith of the 80s a deserved title given her strong renditions of vaudeville blues material her powerful voice is also well suited to more modern blues styles becoming a popular attraction at blues festivals all over the world not only vocally but for her onstage presence and oomph past years have seen angela voted overseas female artist of the year and her album thinking out loud with her english band the mighty 45s was runner up as the uk album of the year with her favourite four piece band the mighty 45s angela developed her act into one of the hottest live blues soul and gospel shows seen outside chicago time out touring in the uk with gta on their successful american festival of the blues angela brown is a classy powerful fusion of musical talent performing a seamless mix of blues soul rock and jazz in her subtle but hard hitting style angela has the sort of voice that fully unleashed could strip the ronseal off your floorboards
3997778 the hottest blues soul jazz gospel show seen outside of chicago
3997779 with a voice as deep and hot as the earths core angela brown proves beyond doubt that her ranking alongside etta james and koko taylor is fully justified
3997780 they are a classy and powerful live experience marks out of ten eleven
3997781 its hard to isolate one member from the incredibly tight fusion of musical talent that makes up the mighty 45s they make the hairs on the back of your next stand up
3997782 raucous raunchy and rumbustious the earthy chicago diva angela brown and the excellent mighty 45s established an immediate rapport with the capacity crowd
3997783 its a huge situation for me after 35 years because ive wanted to bring one back
3997784 this whole thing unfolded about two weeks ago when these two boys came on a talk show here in the states and announced theyd found a bigfoot body
3997785 the commentator asked them if they could send someone to see the body and they said the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body is the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
3997786 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there
3997787 i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being
3997788 we trekked in for a day a half what kind of lunatic would be out here in a monkey suit i saw the thing i touched it
3997789 theyre fine guys one works for the police department in georgia and the other was a correctional officer theyre pretty credible guys
3997790 well release the dna analysis and well have the body right next to the two boys then you can see its real that its not all bullshit
3997791 as long as his part time business doesnt affect his work ethic
3997792 his claims of finding bigfoot is entirely a different matter unfortunately thats spilling over into his police life and thats where we have concerns when he comes back from medical leave well have to sit down and address those issues
3997793 i didnt have to think long about it when i heard about hearts interest i wanted to come here as my number one choice i have the same agent as peter lovenkrands who played at rangers and we talked a little i wasnt in any doubt i wanted to come here because i have been following scottish football the football here ive always been very impressed with because its very physical strong football thats one of my strengths peter said there are three big clubs rangers celtic and hearts for me hearts are one of the big three but the first goal is to get in the top six and after that we will set new goals
3997794 im here for this year and after i hope i will join hearts this is a one year loan but i hope to join hearts on a permanent contract this move is not to get anywhere else hearts are in my mind now and thats what im concentrating on
3997795 the more things change the more they stay the same
3997796 i think its a fair sentence i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way

3997836 the disturbing conclusion documented in a paper i have written with several of the worlds leading climate experts is that the safe level of atmospheric carbon dioxide is no more than 350 ppm parts per million and it may be less carbon dioxideis already at 385 ppm and its rising about 2 ppm per year stunning corollary the oft stated goal to keep global warming less than two degrees celsius 3 6 degrees fahrenheit is a recipe for global disaster not salvation
3997837 humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed
3997838 if you leave us at 450ppm for long enough it will probably melt all the ice thats a sea rise of 75 metres what we have found is that the target we have all been aiming for is a disaster a guaranteed disaster
3997839 a crescut num rul divor urilor n ultima perioad mai ales n cazurile n care unul dintre parteneri este plecat la munc ntr o alt ar este vorba de genera ia ntre 30 i 35 de ani de obicei femeile introduc divor ul i cei care divor eaz din aceast cauz provin dintr o clas social submedie
3997840 din punct de vedere social este acceptat ca b rbatul s aib rela ii extraconjugale dar de obicei ei nu i p r sesc familia nu intenteaz divor
3997841 so ul meu a plecat s munceasc n spania acum trei ani vine anual acas dar de fiecare dat am sim it o r ceal din partea lui anul acesta ns a fost cel mai dureros nici eu nu l mai iubeam a a c anul acesta s a produs ruptura care plutea n aer de mult timp mi a spus c vrea s ne desp r im i am fost de acord l am ntrebat de ce i nu a putut s mi dea un r spuns cert nu tiu dac i a g sit pe altcineva acolo nici nu mai conteaz nu ne mai iubim i cred c e cel mai bine a a pentru am ndoi
3997842 n momentul n care s a luat hot r rea ca unul dintre membri s plece la munc ntr o alt ar nu s a g ndit c asta poate duce la ruperea c sniciei dar timpul trece i ochii care nu se v d se uit oamenii au nevoie de dragoste de apropiere iar banii nu pot compensa lipsa unui partener cu care s mp rt easc evenimentele de zi cu zi
3997843 dup opt luni de la plecarea mea so ul m a anun at c vrea s divor eze i g sise pe altcineva am vorbit cu patronii din italia i m am dus acas pentru a mi salva c snicia so ul meu a refuzat categoric am suferit enorm
3997844 rata divor urilor a crescut enorm mai ales de c nd s a deschis pia a muncii iar membrii familiei tr iesc n medii profesionale diferite principala cauz care determin migrarea membrilor este faptul c pia a de munc a devenit global n acest moment primeaz situa ia material nu confortul familiei

3997850 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3997851 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3997852 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3997853 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3997854 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3997855 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3997856 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3997857 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3997858 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3997859 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3997860 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3997861 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3997862 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3997863 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3997864 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3997865 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3997866 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3997867 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3997868 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3997869 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3997870 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3997871 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3997872 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3997873 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3997874 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3997875 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3997876 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

3997882 if indeed russia is violating the ceasefire and i have to say the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the ceasefire for the pledge that it undertook that will only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
3997883 that russia can use its overwhelming regional military power in this way against a small neighbour is obvious that russia can do that and bear no consequences for it or that russia can push far enough to try and destroy the georgian state i think that is what is different russia cannot succeed in those

3997894 this month we are pretending to visit other places around the world so we are planning a real visit to the international district in seattle to eat some different food talk to some people and basically try to experience another culture
3997895 i know theres an interest in this and i know its a topical debate but you just honestly cant make judgments about this issue at this point in time we havent determined any projects
3997896 it may be that theyre transurban not affected that theres no claim at all it may be that there is but you cant make those judgments until later this year so im not prepared really to predict or make assessments its completely hypothetical

3997905 keep your eyes open and you will see a rebirth of iraqi sports with a much more robust team in 2012
3997906 i really hope theyre finding ways they didnt know the community is already sustainable our hope is they take away knowledge about opportunities they werent aware of

3998005 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3998006 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3998007 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3998008 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3998009 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3998083 i dont see what the problem is you and i and everyone here are subject to harassment all the time and constantly reminded that we are an abhorrent to the faith so why be part of a religion that rejects you
3998084 the authorities tell us that what we do is bad as we are men and should behave like men
3998085 and on television you have male actors dressed in drag and playing it up to the hilt and the language used this makes us look bad
3998086 it doesnt help when a few ts also play up to the myth by being loud and crass

3998106 series tickets will be available to audience members up until the first show of the series
3998107 in addition to entire series purchases you are able to create your own series of shows where you can choose which shows youd like to attend
3998108 youve probably heard this before but its one of the best examples of the relationship between failure and success that i know of
3998109 each of us has our own personal failure quotient in other words how many times is a person willing to fail before succeeding how many times are they willing to get knocked down and then get back up knowing that they are almost certain to get knocked back down again how much failure can they endure on the road to success
3998110 perhaps the single most important factor that determines if a person will achieve everything they want in life or simply settle for crumbs is their failure quotient
3998111 babe ruth is remembered for his record 714 homeruns not his 1 330 strikeouts which was also a record
3998112 when everything in life is over and done with no one will remember your failures just your successes
3998113 they took 33 girls and we all went to the camp in lake placid for a week
3998114 at the last day they just told us who was on the team i was excited obviously ive been trying to get on this team for awhile
3998115 there were four goalies and they took two of us they split us up into two teams two goalies on each team they tested us on weight training how much we could lift wed have goalie practice in the morning and then we had team practices we did scrimmages against the other team that was pretty much every day
3998116 i think my mom was more excited than i was
3998117 i got phone calls from everybody my whole familys going to come up to canada this week and watch the games
3998118 her dad and i were ecstatic when she called us
3998119 i think we were all crying on the phone because thats just a childhood dream of hers
3998120 she went to some camp for girls who want to look into playing girls hockey
3998121 her dad and i wanted her to but we really didnt want her to because it was so much traveling just to go to practice we had to go to kent state and drive that a couple days a week
3998122 its a great story about how effort can pay off for you
3998123 she came to us pretty raw from the ohio flames organization and shes developed over her three years here
3998124 my assistant coach scott spencer who works with our goaltenders has spent a lot of time with her working with the technical side of the game and the mental side of the game thats certainly a huge recruiting tool for us to have a player break through into the national scene because we have good players here
3998125 since youre little you always want to do that and be in the olympics
3998126 i never really thought anything of it i never really paid attention till my coach started talking to me about it maybe last year id just like to get a shot at the olympics
3998127 shes got some work ahead of her because there are great players in the usa hockey program with the senior team currently but given the right opportunity and the set of circumstances the balls in her court and what she does with it will be up to her
3998128 i definitely think she has what it takes because shes a fantastic person youd be hard pressed to find somebody that works as hard as diligently as she does on her game which is what you need to be at that level if she continues to progress and play well we could see her wearing the usa jersey in vancouver
3998129 last year before two a days even started he told us we were going to go 3 0
3998130 he told us we are going to be state champs this year and i believe him
3998131 our big focus during the offseason has been on the weightlifting program because we felt when we got to the conference schedule everybody was bigger and stronger than us
3998132 so we put a big emphasis on the weight room and strength training and the kids have responded and i feel were very very strong just like when we went to ec and they had been losing and they were weak we focused on the weight room and the next year we were in the playoffs
3998133 i think weve addressed the strength issue this is a totally different team we are very strong i dont know if were as strong as we need to be but compared to last year were light years ahead
3998134 we have all made it known to each other that it is going to be a good season
3998135 as long as we work together we have the potential to do great things
3998136 we just didnt have the heart last year that we do this season
3998137 we had speed everybody was fast but we didnt have the heart or the power coach had us lifting all through the summer and were just a lot bigger than last year
3998138 this year everyones paying attention and they are all asking the coaches questions during practices
3998139 ive never seen anything like it it looks like a real classroom during film study now
3998140 when he said that we had 40 kids in the weight room the day the season ended
3998141 all we have to do is make the playoffs and then well be playing teams more our size i watched the division v state championship game last year and the two teams looked pretty big they looked like state championship teams
3998142 i think by the time the end of the season comes around we could look like that
3998143 i figured they would come out angry against us i wish we would have played them in the third game of tournament pool play instead of the second
3998144 without him in the goal in the first game as well as this game we wouldnt have stood a chance
3998145 he kept us in the game in the first half
3998146 in the past few games we have had trouble scoring the first goal
3998147 chiles players were wound too tight when they relaxed they could score
3998148 in the second half i told them now is the time this is a national team they have a big responsibility its up to them to respond
3998149 we only needed two goals to tie i thought we had a chance right up until the very end
3998150 man we fleeced the phillies to get nick punto what a third baseman

3998157 vulnerable to identity theft stalking discrimination unwarranted surveillance or loss of employment
3998158 i think that rushing this decision is not in the public interest
3998159 my motivation here is to make the alley vacation be in the public interest
3998160 the uo manufactured this sense of urgency to get us to prematurely grant them this alley vacation so that they can get this part under their belt but theyre going to really sit on this for several months
3998161 verbal warnings and or the display of a taser without activation
3998162 home movies allow us to revisit the past through film
3998163 we are the pioneer diaries that people 100 years from now will want to watch
3998164 the class is really about experiencing what is happening and seeing what it is like down there
3998165 my hope is that students will be able to better relate to the immigrant population
3998166 this class is everything i should have already learned after growing up in a town with such a large immigrant population
3998167 these men were like my uncles and i didnt want to be disrespectful to them
3998168 one of the men said to me god doesnt punish
3998169 and all i could think about was how strong those men are i had talked to the day before crossing for three days and three nights with no food or water

3998181 pengamanan melalui pengintaian udara di wilayah barat hingga ini masih dilakukan oleh skadron 5 intai yang berada di bawah naungan koopsau ii di makassar
3998182 jadi untuk membangun skadron intai di wilayah koopsau i belum akan dilakukan dalam jangka pendek dan menengah kemungkinan itu akan dimasukkan dalam perencanaan jangak panjang bagaimana pun keberadaan skadron intai sangat diperlukan juga di wilayah barat indonesia
3998183 tidak dipungkiri dengan tugas itu diperlukan skadron pesawat intai bahkan penambahan skadron tempur tetapi itu belum dapat dilaksanakan dalam waktu dekat karena terbatasnya anggaran
3998184 its interesting how bonkers the media and the far right wingers are about our comment sections well in the heavily vetted esponsible for a murder in ar to tell obama that he would be assassinated if he doesnt fall in line is as sick as it gets

3998195 looking back to the times when i was still a guru more or less there is a remarkable difference in how i felt during this seminar there was none of the very subtle tension the subtle power game that was always there in the back ground for me in the past just to be clear i perceive that subtle tension in retrospect if you would have asked me then i would have most probably denied its existence let me explain when you are guiding people towards a higher spiritual realization on a vertical ladder of ascent to a spiritual highest goal you must be both at least one step further than they are so as to also provide for the transmission of the energy from a higher altitude and you need to have ways and means at your disposal to help them move upwards this is possibly one factor for that subtle tension another one is that when there are other men present there is a basic masculine principle at work you have to prove your status since the spiritual leader guru master or whatever you want to call him is also the alpha male and this also always translates as status it is subtly and sometimes not so subtly under attack hence tension the spiritual path understood as it almost always is as a path of acention wilber cohen others love to talk about altitude a higher lower hierarchy where higher is regarded as more enlightened you quite naturally needs leaders gurus masters spiritual teachers if you are called to play that role as i felt i was for some 6 7 years then quite naturally you always stretch to the ceiling do your very very best to stay within the higher reaches of your realization all the times at least when youre not in the realm of sahaj samadhi spontaneously going on which nobody is as i know from being personally with some enlightened teachers in their private life beyond the need to perform their role service

3998209 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3998210 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3998211 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3998212 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3998374 i can say consistently it has cost about 100 000 more to operate than it brings in
3998375 its probably 25 percent of what it might have been 25 years ago
3998376 but hell listen very carefully to what the committee recommends
3998377 for us the building is familiar and it feels like home
3998378 but we know from living here that its a burden on the diocese weve watched the use decline over the last five or six years
3998379 were trying to be realistic about it but theres some emotional stuff going on
3998380 whenever im having someone come out from town i tell them to look for that
3998381 the people of the community that grew up in my era weve watched one school after another be destroyed theyre almost all gone now
3998382 i hate to hear that they would even consider tearing it down im not a bit in favor of that at all
3998383 we would get a piece of bread wrapping you know wax paper and kind of slick up the seat so youd slide faster and better we werent supposed to go down it but we did
3998384 why would you save the larson building why would you save the church building that became the performing arts center there in yakima its in the category
3998385 i think if everybody puts their heads together we can come up with a decent use for it
3998386 look what theyve done in tieton to the warehouse up there
3998387 if somebody wanted to donate a million dollars to renovate the building
3998388 i dont see us having the resources to transform it into a modern retreat facility
3998389 people shouldnt expect a wrecking ball out there anytime soon
3998390 there is an urgent need to foster innovation as the world is inching closer to the goal of eradicating dreadful diseases especially for the early childhood by providing effective vaccines
3998391 we are looking back at a difficult second quarter which saw our efforts to improve profitability being undone by further cost increases at current long term projects integration measures at recently acquired group companies as well as delays of key project awards
3998392 wir blicken auf ein schwieriges zweites quartal zur ck in dem unsere anstrengungen zur ergebnisverbesserung durch weitere kostensteigerungen in laufenden langfristprojekten integrationsma nahmen in k rzlich erworbenen gruppenfirmen sowie die verz gerung von bedeutenden projektvergaben zunichte gemacht worden sind
3998393 the need for consensus is as important as for the grp it is wisdom to consult ask questions and secure assistance regarding directions and goals from stakeholders for the government consult with the different branches of government and with the people directly affected by conflict
3998394 we have to clear first many things it seems that the moa ad has many complexities it fails to reach proper consultations the language used in the agreement is vague and it was done in haste
3998395 the key to acceptability of the moa ad is consultation and dialogue information and education and building a constituency supportive of the general goals and specific objectives as well as the processes and contents of the peace negotiations
3998396 there is a global fight against terrorism and for that the us government is helping us in our thrust to end terroristic activities
3998397 the president wants that rebellion in mindanao should come to an end for after all we have already sacrificed a lot and many lives and properties have been wasted
3998398 we did what we could we have tried our best to come up with this sub agreement on the third substantive aspect identified by the parties under the grp milf tripoli agreement on peace of 2001 im sorry if it felt short of your expectation bishop and the expectations of your people in zamboanga
3998399 for what you grp have done you grp have lost the people of zamboanga city you missed to conduct consultation and dialogue which are very important
3998400 it was a very costly mistake that barangays zone 3 and 4 were included in the moa ad
3998401 it is not always at all times that we have to consult the people otherwise the process will become interminable
3998402 i have strong disagreements of what garcia press secretary jesus dureza and presidential adviser on the peace process sec hermogenes esperon jr said
3998403 i will still stand by what i have said in public that i have strong disagreements with the statements of the grp panel
3998404 the bje instead of gaining the trust of the people breeds mistrust for the people of zamboanga city
3998405 had not the proposed moa ad between grp milf made public we would never have known that barangays zone 3 and 4 have been included in the bje
3998406 we have nothing against peace process we dont want to breed hatred and mistrust between muslims and christians what we need are transparency proper consultation and dialogue
3998407 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3998408 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
3998409 i think mccain has to have a running mate that clearly connects with social conservatives in the party
3998410 that is where he is lacking so if he picks a pro choice running mate i dont see how he can win this race
3998411 im not going to say people will stay home but there is a core of voters whose level of enthusiasm influences people further from the core
3998412 so if mccain picks a pro choice running mate the strength of turnout on election day is not going to be there for him
3998413 iyan ba ang gusto ninyong mamuno sa atin kung magtagumpay na
3998414 arroyos deception is further exposed by the fact that federalism cannot be achieved by the mere amendment of one or two provisions
3998415 congress as a constituent assembly assumes a different constitutional entity and function and cannot therefore be bound by a legislative act such as a joint resolution since it is empowered by the constitution to amend not a mere law but the constitution itself
3998416 it is therefore clear that arroyo is merely riding on the issues of federalism and peace in mindanao to push for charter change which is ultimately aimed at prolonging her stay in power and eliminating the protectionist economic provisions in the constitution in fact she can stay beyond 2010 via the surgical amendment of deleting the term limit on the presidency in article vii sec 4
3998417 these dress codes apart from being sexist can lead to foot and back problems
3998418 at the age of 7 months babies will watch a fearful face for longer than a happy face and their attentiveness level as measured by eeg is higher after seeing a fearful than a happy face
3998419 by contrast infants aged 5 months watch both faces when they are shown side by side for just as long and there is no difference in the intensity of attention in favour of the fearful face
3998420 our interpretation of this is to suggest that the brain mechanisms that specialise in emotional response and especially in processing threatening stimuli regulate and intensify the processing of facial expressions by age 7 months
3998421 any attempt by him to dislodge the government using his authority under article 58 2b of the constitution will plunge the country into yet another election the results of which are unlikely to differ greatly from the february 18 poll he can also reach out to his hand picked supreme court to halt the impeachment process on technical grounds but given the prevailing public opinion the supreme court will be hesitant to oblige him
3998422 musharraf knows that the army will ensure that he will not face trial and will be provided safe exit particularly if he chooses to leave office voluntarily he is likely to give serious consideration to this option as the formal impeachment proceedings get underway musharraf has few resources to draw on and the prospects for his survival in office are slim pakistan is at a crossroads there could be a prolonged impeachment struggle which would push the country towards greater instability or musharraf might resign or succumb to a quick impeachment process which could help stabilise the ppp led coalition government
3998423 if government efforts to help northern cities since the 1950s had succeeded then there would be no gap in living standards or employment or educational achievement or health yet the gaps have persisted and in many cases widened you hope to live a long life try hampshire not hull you dream of a three car household thats surrey not sunderland you seek energy creativity cutting edge employment head for london not liverpool

3998426 this week as he spoke robust words on the georgian crisis that struck the right note it felt as though david cameron had reached a tipping point in one respect it was a small matter opposition leader makes statement on international crisis some hot air involved but at least he displayed a sense of purpose the governments response to the russian aggression in georgia has been typical of the return we are making to the genteel management of british decline britain is the fourth largest economy in the world the second power of consequence in the command structure of nato and it was day five in the crisis before the pm appeared in front of a television camera to say anything

3998434 the price of gasoline was reduced because of many factors and the most important factor is the decline of world crude oil prices
3998435 with the current world crude oil price so low and the newly adjusted domestic gasoline price the fuel trading companies are no longer losing money
3998436 but they have to compensate for the accumulated losses they had made before which had reached trillions of dong

3998458 using the name of israel was only meant to show that the friendship message of the iranian nation to the people of the world is very inclusive
3998459 it is obvious that this word israel is the most hated word not only from irans political perspective but also across the world
3998460 this word is reminder of racism inhumanity and violence and i also believe that there will be no place for this word in irans culture

3998471 they are probably on the outside not as attractive as what weve got at the moment but certainly on the inside they are twice as good as anything being offered at the anu at the moment
3998472 students in accommodation at the anu are pretty damn happy theyre paying less than the rest of us and enjoy the on campus experience
3998473 if we can give more students that experience for such a cheap cost that would be fantastic
3998474 the ones in amsterdam which are student accommodation and built like a hall of residence they look fantastic
3998475 theyre bright theyre a little bit weird the using the word funky
3998476 you could tell theyre a shipping container but you can tell theyre a place of residence
3998477 theyre very long and very slim it is the normal size of a shipping container
3998478 they take the ends off both sides one side is an entrance door you walk in and youve got a small kitchen on your right then theres a little corridor with a bathroom and a toilet separate
3998479 then if you go though to the back theres room for a double bed a small couch and a television and theres a balcony off the back
3998480 its a combination of a few things firstly were taking more students at the anu from interstate and overseas as the anus reputation goes up
3998481 weve got more students coming in that arent from canberra which means weve got more of a demand for students who arent living at home
3998482 secondly the canberra rental market is making it pretty tough
3998483 theyre still at the planning stages and nothing is set in stone

3998487 my concerns are that people in australian workplaces are treated decently
3998488 i certainly have said in relation to telstra that work choices is a thing of australias past not its future
3998489 the workplace ombudsman will certainly respond if a complaint is made the workplace ombudsman has looked at some matters in relation to telstra in the past when complaints have been made i would note that the workplace ombudsman would assist any australian worker who believes they need that assistance generally i would say to telstra and i would say to all australian companies we want to see cooperative industrial relations
3998490 the leaked documents show the company is determined to defy the rudd government on its industrial relations policy
3998491 the documents show telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3998492 were now talking to our staff about collective agreements to make sure that they have the best terms and conditions
3998493 nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3998494 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3998495 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3998496 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3998497 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3998498 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3998499 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3998500 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3998501 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital

3998510 this is not because of the quality of treatment in beijing far from it but because the hospital in hong kong has specialised equipment hill may need
3998511 we hope he pulls through he is an australian we are giving him as much assistance as possible
3998512 it was a big step for him and he was really looking forward to it especially the equestrian events its just really unfortunate whats happened

3998524 discover how to easily speak fluent french in less than 8 weeks with
3998525 its a huge situation for me after 35 years because ive wanted to bring one back
3998526 this whole thing unfolded about two weeks ago when these two boys came on a talk show here in the states and announced theyd found a bigfoot body
3998527 the commentator asked them if they could send someone to see the body and they said the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body is the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
3998528 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there
3998529 i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being
3998530 we trekked in for a day a half what kind of lunatic would be out here in a monkey suit i saw the thing i touched it
3998531 theyre fine guys one works for the police department in georgia and the other was a correctional officer theyre pretty credible guys
3998532 well release the dna analysis and well have the body right next to the two boys then you can see its real that its not all bullshit
3998533 as long as his part time business doesnt affect his work ethic
3998534 his claims of finding bigfoot is entirely a different matter unfortunately thats spilling over into his police life and thats where we have concerns when he comes back from medical leave well have to sit down and address those issues

3998564 its criminals who should be afraid its the bad politicians who should be afraid its the judges who set these murderers free the ones who should be afraid its the corrupt police officers who should be afraid not us
3998565 we want a specific political accord between the president and all 32 governors of mexico to commit to reducing the rates of kidnapping in mexico
3998566 the state is not dismantling organized crime groups through the confiscation of assets freezing of assets of the financial intelligence unit and is not cooperating with police and prosecutors effectively
3998567 because nothing much has been done every day there are more and more kidnappings and everybody is affected
3998568 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future

3998575 i guess i have to pay the fee it is like you have us at gunpoint

3998589 the situation of over supply and saturation resulting in the subsequent correction of rentals may occur in certain pockets and micro markets in the short to medium term said the cb richard ellis report
3998590 it is to bring more focus to the vertical and integrated development with the existing real estate activities
3998591 though the market is very big if you do not have the strategy right success will be hard to come by realtors do have some synergies in the retail sector but at the same time many of the stores are closing due to high rentals
3998592 you want to go to the temple but you dont have a personal relationship with the lord you dont pray
3998593 i used to pray a lot up until a month ago but i dont pray anymore
3998594 well i asked him to save my marriage and he didnt
3998595 linda you know the lord doesnt work like that what could you do to help your marriage
3998596 im divorced but i could still be married if i chose to take care of john financially for the rest of my life and if i didnt get upset over his girlfriends and if i smiled living with a depressed person is no fun
3998597 well linda you know depression and discouragement are the devils greatest tools
3998598 i prayed for god to touch johns heart to make his want to change so that he would love me and love luke and want to take care of us
3998599 i remember reading an article in the ensign which told the steps to a happy marriage one step was to say youre sorry and really mean it another was to pray specifically for your family and your relationships at least once a day the article stated that it was even better if you could pray twice a day well you couldnt count the number of times that i prayed i prayed and i prayed and i prayed and it was a righteous desire too a righteous prayer families are forever i had faith i knew god would make john change
3998600 but those men youre talking about were harming a great number of people they almost destroyed the church at the time
3998601 what does that say for the worth of a soul
3998602 never mind i dont need an answer i accept it for whatever reason there was i dont know why god wouldnt touch johns heart but he didnt okay i can accept that the semester i left him he was on academic probation for the third time three of his professors sat him down and told him that if he didnt start to make progress theyd have to let him go but johns got his p r skills down so pat that by the end of the meeting he had a once a week dinner appointment at two of the professors homes he probably told them that his wife took his beloved son away and he was at his wits end conveniently forgetting to mention his understanding girlfriends it wouldnt have taken a miracle he could have been expelled or ex ed or both and if he had been im sure he would have left the valley he would have nothing to keep him here its so hard for me to handle the hypocrisy im forced to deal with daily having him here it makes my whole life my whole understanding of the gospel and the values ive been taught a farce john should not get away with what he has done and it wouldnt take a miracle it would just take someone in some position of authority to be inspired enough to see through him well god didnt choose to do things that way okay i dont understand it but i accept it so then i prayed for one last thing i prayed for a friend you see after youve been called a bitch to your face for over three years more often than youve been called your own name you begin to think you are one you begin to feel like a bitch and when you look in the mirror thats what you see i mean my own husband didnt love me after all i did for him when that happens you look deep inside and you start to think that something is really wrong with you i didnt pray for a lover or a spouse or even two dates in a row i just needed to know that god was aware of me and my needs and that he loved me and really wanted me to be happy that this was just some terrible mistake and that he would work things out i needed to know that i was okay and that someone somewhere could find me attractive and want to spend time with me of his own free will not because he had been set up but just because he thought i would be a person he would take pleasure in being with i just wanted to go out to eat and talk with someone or go on a walk or or anything it could have happened i try to keep myself up i meet people at school and at work its not like i sit home all day eating chocolates and watching soap operas so i set up a time limit i asked him for a date by the end of march that should have been plenty of time i was friendly to everyone i met and i tried to be happy but i guess that was just too big of a miracle for god to pull off he could feed the israelites manna for forty years when they didnt even ask for it but he couldnt find linda date so anyway i dont pray i have prayed every prayer there were no prayers left in me you see if i were to set myself up even one more time and then be let down again i dont thinking i could make it
3998603 vengeance is mine saith the lord i cant let you go to the temple in this spirit
3998604 yes im bitter but its natural to be bitter and bishop jensen said that going to the temple would help he said it would be good for me to be in the presence of the lords spirit
3998605 i think it would just be a bad experience for you at this time look linda my wife and i had three lovely healthy boys and then we had a baby with downs syndrome do you think i was bitter
3998606 i accepted what the lord gave me the lord will never give you more than you can handle
3998607 the temple is a very special place its for special people
3998608 you have some serious problems to overcome first divorce is very serious do you realize youve given up the right to an eternal family
3998609 its not that big of a deal my best girlfriend is just getting married and she asked me to be there but like i said shes my best girlfriend shell understand
3998610 he has given you supportive parents you should thank him for that who knows it might have been worse if he had done what you asked maybe you really didnt need those things
3998611 even if i only thought i needed them thats still a need and if god is showing me how much he loves me by giving me such great parents he must sure hate luke to give him such a rotten father
3998612 linda i dont like you anymore and im never going to do anything nice for you again
3998613 look linda i really hate to cut this short but im due at sacrament meeting in ten minutes to help bless my grandson just pray about it please god love luke and wants you to be a good mother for him come back next week after youve thought about the things ive said and after youve prayed you simply wont be happy until you can forgive john and accept the lord and his ways

3998622 on the campaign trail john mccain likes to brag about chairing the senate indian affairs committee that investigated criminal lobbyist jack abramoffs role in the republican culture of corruption
3998623 and i know hawaii is a state but it has the look of him going off to some sort of foreign exotic place he should be in myrtle beach if hes going to take a vacation at this time
3998624 yes obama cant help but look like a high flying elitist by spending his vacation in hawaii regardless of the fact that he was born there and that his grandmother lives there and the fact that you know hawaii is one of the 50 states
3998625 and while they are making arrangements to send sen obama to myrtle beach they need to get him to switch sports basketball is for elites after all real americans and real american presidents play golf in myrtle beach
3998626 saying our 50th state is somehow foreign does a great disservice to the hardworking patriotic americans who call hawaii home
3998627 for months people have been asking me when is sen obama going to come home im so glad he found time to visit his sister and his grandmother and for him and his family to bond and recharge in his home state hawaii is a great u s destination just ask the 5 5 million americans who visited last year for business and pleasure
3998628 aside from the general ridiculousness of casting aspersions on the american ness of hawaii ms roberts criticism smacks of the worst prejudices faced by asian americans im sure if he had decided to go to the exclusive golfing resort of myrtle beach instead the press would have dutifully reported how american his vacation was and how regular americans could identify with such a lavish trip
3998629 i would love to take ms roberts on a tour of oahu with stops at the arizona memorial and punchbowl followed by a visit with hawaii army national guard soldiers training for their second deployment to the middle east
3998630 then i would take her to eastside grill to watch team usa womens volleyball and bryan clay i would introduce her to hawaii residents so she could witness our diversity and learn about the aloha spirit part of what makes america great is the unique contributions of all 50 states sen obama has every right to come home and visit his sister and grandmother

3998632 we kregen ook de beste kansen via romano denneboom en marko arnautovic daarvan had er eigenlijk minimaal n in gemoeten dat gebeurde niet waarna we via een dood spelmoment de 0 1 tegen kregen zoiets is natuurlijk doodzonde dat mag eigenlijk niet gebeuren we hebben onszelf flink tekort gedaan met dit resultaat we hadden minimaal n keer moeten scoren
3998633 als je zelf je kansen niet afmaakt weet je dat het moeilijk wordt dat zag je vorig weekend ook toen arsenal in de amsterdam arena een oefenwedstrijd speelde tegen ajax arsenal is zon team dat na rust nog even flink gas kan geven en dan is het gebeurd heel jammer want tot die 0 1 hadden we onze zaakjes goed voor elkaar
3998634 dat is precies het verschil tussen een topclub als arsenal en een subtopper als fc twente
3998635 wij kregen drie grote kansen en maakten er niet n terwijl arsenal uit twee mogelijkheden twee keer scoort
3998636 ik raakte de bal nog wel maar omdat ik uitgleed kon ik geen kracht zetten helaas
3998637 we see the significant impact that schizophrenia can have on patients and their families
3998638 we applaud the bc government in its decision to have a treatment option available that is easy to use and accessible to people with schizophrenia that will help them manage their illness and improve their quality of life
3998639 we recognize the bc governments support of a more focused approach on health promotion and disease prevention the listing of seroquel xr on the bc pharmacare formulary is a positive step forward in improving patient access to mental health care in the province
3998640 astrazeneca remains committed to partnering with the government to further support their work on developing sustainable solutions
3998641 i started painting when i was 50 imagine if i started when i was younger i might actually be good
3998642 god if id started when i was younger just think how good id be now
3998643 i figure every time i paint a picture i learn something
3998644 i had a theater set up in the basement and charged a penny for admission
3998645 you want people to look at a painting and say gee thats a dean davis
3998646 i can paint as i please if somebody likes it great
3998647 jeanne myself and joan audette also from community ed sat back and we witnessed the magic begin
3998648 the tenants told stories of their parents childhood their school experiences wwii their jobs over the years and raising families the kids were drawn in by these wonderful story tellers some tenants brought in pictures of the past and others brought in scrapbooks and souvenirs needless to say the one and a half hour time slot almost always ran over each week as the two groups hated to part
3998649 it brought tears to my eyes as i witnessed the smiles on both the kids and senior faces
3998650 i think people today think all the kids in school are bad
3998651 we have a lot of hard work ahead of us
3998652 we did finish last in the nfc east we have to make sure we buckle ourselves down like we have the last couple weeks here and finish the rest of camp and preseason the right way it hasnt been easy and it wont be easy once we get into the grind its tough to climb back up that ladder
3998653 we are very fortunate to have all three of them
3998654 right now we are just in the process of getting a support staff set up for him in philadelphia
3998655 we have taken and made some direction there or at least have it going in the right direction there
3998656 he was playing so well at the end of the season that i think he just picked up from there
3998657 obviously you try to keep getting better but he was just playing at such a high level there i dont see where its a huge jump from that
3998658 you need a game plan and make sure you are organized
3998659 we are hoping to have matt barr to play hardy brown
3998660 we are very excited to welcome one of borders new concept stores to watters creek
3998661 borders is already a great store for books and entertainment but i think customers are really going to be impressed with what they find at this location this store adds another unique and important element to the mix at watters creek
3998662 this has been an extremely troubling case from the start
3998663 the way they used the obscenity statutes in this case goes far beyond the original intent of the law and sadly theyll mark this down in their books as a victory
3998664 the united states government has now secured an obscenity conviction based solely on the written word i think thats extremely dangerous
3998665 the premise of this prosecution is that words have power
3998666 mr kaufman has a more active imagination than i do if he thinks that written thoughts are more horrific than actual child abuse thats a very odd way to approach the world
3998667 we did absolutely everything that we could to raise constitutional issues pretrial
3998668 as this thing kept going forward it became obvious that karen fletcher was not able to face a trial or god forbid a prison sentence if we lost
3998669 she would not have been able to stand up through all of this or sit in a prison cell during an appeal if necessary she was not able to be the standard bearer for these first amendment issues that the government was attacking
3998670 i never meant for anything like this to happen im sorry
3998671 if anyone would have read the story and acted upon it a little child could have suffered devastation that you would have had to live with for the rest of your life
3998672 but what they did was get fletcher to plead guilty because she was scared to death to go to prison what we saw with this case was just the further erosion of first amendment rights
3998673 and not the type of defendant you push to get a pound of flesh off of
3998674 this was a resolution that allowed the government to save face and will have essentially no impact on karen fletchers life
3998675 shes an agoraphobic who doesnt leave the house so house arrest is meaningless
3998676 you dont know what love is you just do as youre told
3998677 i personally knew all the guys from different gigs social gatherings so i decided to phone each one of them individually as i saw the potential as a band with all four of these individuals together it was literally a case of throwing everyone in the pot and seeing what came out
3998678 coke fest was awesome so was kirstenbosch but i personally like the small pub and club gigs the best
3998679 some of our best gigs have been to just the staff and barmen
3998680 to be honest it was totally unexpected as were an english band and this was an afrikaans festival
3998681 it was nice to get this recognition as it was still early days and it gave us a nice platform from which to launch ourselves
3998682 we all have different influences which explain our sound its actually hard to define as there are many styles incorporated within our music were generally very open minded when it comes to influences which i believe is crucial in a bands development
3998683 its very different to our other albums but still has the bricks sound its just part of our musical journey
3998684 i think our main priority is to just get our new album released and take it from there its hard to predict the future as when things happen in music they either happen very quickly or not at all so well just see how it goes
3998685 we just want to have fun but hey it would be nice to make some money and tour internationally

3998695 i think it is really a reward for the trade union leaders whove supported us and members who had to make substantial commitments to the future
3998696 they made big decisions in the 80s and 90s which i think has stood the nation in good stead really
3998697 and its a recognition of their contribution rather than me personally
3998698 the workplace is like australia as a whole its changing its changing rapidly
3998699 what i think has been able to be demonstrated is that youve got to change with it and in some senses in advance of it in order to make progress
3998700 you dont strive for recognition when you join something like the police force but the recognition is nice and i think it says a lot for the people ive been able to work with
3998701 he did it all for his electorate and he believed that was his role to represent his constituents and i think he did that in a very honourable and efficient way
3998702 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
3998703 for another two days russian troops will remain in the gori region to transfer control to georgian police and then they will leave
3998704 we still have diplomatic relations with georgia we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia
3998705 but we wont directly talk to saakashvili we wont do that we offered him peace but not friendship
3998706 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3998707 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict
3998708 we need a government that transfers power to the elected representatives of the people to carry out the peoples mandate for change
3998709 our people continue to face a profound humanitarian crisis this destructive policy of banning humanitarian assistance can be reversed with one letter
3998710 tragically zimbabwe has become one of the worst man made humanitarian disasters of a new and hopeful century
3998711 because of the failed policies of zanu pf five million zimbabweans now face starvation and famine we cannot allow this to happen
3998712 we knew negotiations would be difficult but a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
3998713 there is no way you can extract a bilateral agreement from a tripartite process
3998714 the leaders of our political parties must rise up to the challenge to provide leadership
3998715 is going to consult with the chinese regarding efforts to secure a strong verification regime and additional progress in the six party talks
3998716 he is expected to conclude his meeting in beijing over the weekend
3998717 i will discuss with assistant secretary hill negotiations with the north on how to draw up a verification mechanism
3998718 im also planning to discuss wrapping up the second stage of nuclear disarmament
3998719 we understand that japan and north korea agreed to the basic outline of a resolution to the abduction issue and to steps for eventual removal of some japanese sanctions on the dprk north korea
3998720 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill
3998721 the idea that there is a state called happiness and that we can dependably figure out what it feels like and how to measure it is extremely subversive
3998722 deep economy the wealth of communities and the durable future
3998723 it allows economists to start thinking about life in richer terms to stop asking what did you buy and to start asking is your life good
3998724 for the time being we know that happiness fosters physical health but not precisely how
3998725 chronic unhappiness activates the fight flight response which is known to involve harmful effects in the long run such as higher blood pressure and a lower immune response
3998726 if we feel unhealthy we go to a medical general practitioner
3998727 if we feel unhappy there is no such generalist we have to guess
3998728 professional guidance for a happier life is unavailable as yet this is a remarkable market failure given the large number of people who feel they could be happier
3998729 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3998730 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3998731 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3998732 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3998733 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3998734 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3998735 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3998743 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3998744 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3998745 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3998746 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3998747 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3998753 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3998785 as the game can track where the sword is at all times this allows for more complex gameplay the first thing to note is that eyetoy play hero is played from a first person perspective so the players image is not displayed onscreen like most other eyetoy games what is seen onscreen is a glowing green representation of the sword that the player holds and as the game is camera based it follows the players movements to an exact 1 1 ratio

3998789 it is irresponsible of senator obama to play the leadership card just because he is the only leader in this race doesnt mean he has to mention it
3998790 because we havent had leadership in this country for oh a long time and i do not believe the american people are ready for this type of president
3998791 the american people deserve better than a great leader we should build on the legacy of president bush and continue with the his not bright but hes white and he might be silly but hes got a willy type of president it works for me
3998792 banning athletes from olympics will ensure that we have no more threats of political protesting at any of the olympic games
3998793 we believe that athletes have overstepped the boundaries in their protesting at the beijing olympics we will be much more effective in controlling hum i mean managing these blatant disregard for the rules by removing them from the games
3998794 athletes putting their faces on sodas credit cards home improvement stores and cereals from america is a clear political statement about freedom of expression and their support for human rights we cannot tolerate this type of behaviour
3998795 we all carry baggage already and those cash envelopes arent that light you know
3998796 its about time that politicians listen to us they should remember who controls their luggage when they fly and who cleans the toilets before foot tapping at airports
3998797 it is crucial for the nigerian economy that we diversify our bogus income streams we can not rely on oil providing us with the only opportunities to rip off foreigners
3998798 every email scam makes us less dependent on oil from the niger delta
3998799 we will provide them with the training computers and internet access to start their own scams
3998800 my brother in law runna wey is an honorable man and his business lessons for african universities and national direct education in refocusing international and national graft laundering is known for the hard work they do all over the world i just received an email from him telling me how hard he is working and that he requires another advance to complete the curriculum it just shows how hard he works as he always needs more money
3998801 i deny that we are some group of happy people living normal lives this is the type of rumor that gives sects all over the world a good name and we wont tolerate that
3998802 i have a responsibility towards my own life and greed and will not stand for the false allegation
3998803 it is a disgusting rumor and i will not stand for these type of attacks on the evangelical right wing churches
3998804 we have a rich compelling story for the player first and foremost and all the gameplay mechanics serve this experience
3998805 if youre playing this game to kill 5 367 boars and rats or to min max your character youre going to be disappointed instead we have streamlined rpg features slick brutal real time combat and a truly compelling world that begs to be explored
3998806 but the crucial design decision which we took early on was that everything in the game is there to support a compelling narrative experience to borrow the clich its kind of an all killer no filler approach
3998807 would i turn my nose up at another round with shodan no
3998808 we are a friend of all people in the world even israelis and americans
3998809 we do not recognize a country called israel and so we cannot recognize a nation called israel
3998810 if mr mashai does not have the political awareness that the israeli people are the same people who have occupied the homes of millions of innocent and oppressed palestinians and have created the army of the zionist regime he has no right to hold such a position
3998811 dear bother dr haddad adel dear head of islamic parliaments cultural affairs commission
3998812 since my comments on iranian nations friendship with entire world nations including the people of the occupied palestinian territories have led to raising question and ambiguities for some members of that esteemed commission i feel obliged to point out certain mattes for your consideration
3998813 would i turn my nose up at another round with shodan no
3998814 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly
3998815 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3998816 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
3998817 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
3998818 fadel shanas death is a tragedy a journalist in action was killed by idf israel defence force fire along with others not involved in the hostilities however the available evidence does not suggest misconduct or criminal misbehaviour i have therefore decided that no further legal measures will be taken
3998819 the idfs decision to close its probe without taking any disciplinary action is the latest in a long line of cases clearing its soldiers of deadly negligence
3998820 the fpa believes the army is obligated to clearly identify its targets before firing especially in areas where civilians and journalists are present
3998821 good evening and welcome weve gathered here tonight around the fire as people of all lands have gathered for thousands and thousands of years before us to share the light and to share a story an amazing story as old as time itself but still being written and though we each of us have our own individual stories to tell a true adventure emerges when we bring them all together as one i hope you enjoy our story tonight reflections of earth

3998854 it was one of those games i had to fight through it

3998858 what a nice slide mccann didnt know exactly where he was

3998860 when a team goes out and gets early runs you want to go back out and shut the other team down
3998861 you dont see that very often where theres some walks and a lot of hit batters but i think at that point in the game we definitely would take it
3998862 that was big for us because i think zito was doing real well today he was changing speeds and doing great we kind of got in the way of some balls
3998863 at the time i didnt really feel like it was that crazy
3998864 now looking back on it when you think about it it does seem a little odd i didnt realize we had three hit batsmen
3998865 we scored a bunch of runs and didnt hardly have any hits

3998876 having those guys here is pretty special you can kind of hear them starting cheers and getting everybody going its pretty neat

3998904 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3998905 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3998906 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3998907 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3998908 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3998909 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3998910 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3998911 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3998912 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3998913 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3998914 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3998915 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3998916 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3998917 that was aimed at seeing whether humans could do the same thing as for example mice could females pick out the smell of genetically similar or dissimilar males
3998918 we found that the preferences of women having gone on the pill shifted toward genetic similarity
3998919 it suggests that it is specifically the hormonal levels within the pill
3998920 both in terms of successful pregnancies carrying babies to term and potentially in terms of your relationship quality
3998921 the women who were relatively similar to their partner genetically reported lower relationship satisfaction and a greater likelihood of going off to seek affairs
3998922 while i wouldnt presume to tell women what to do
3998923 we know now that the reason people are buying iphones is because they can personalize their experience the expectation was that the app store is what would differentiate the iphone and the numbers seem to bear that out
3998924 i really didnt know that i was going to write something that would be good enough to submit to the app store
3998925 i just thought i would write something i could put on my own phone and maybe put it on a few friends phones i totally did not expect the level of interest that it turns out that there is for doing crosswords on your phone
3998926 basically the first two weeks that the app was in the store i earned more than my entire graduate stipend
3998927 i dont make very much as a graduate student so thats pretty exciting
3998928 now that we have some hard data weve fallen in love with the platform itself
3998929 it hasnt changed our plans away from the consoles but the iphone is definitely part of our road map now
3998930 i have no problems with my situation i have come here to make sure a fantastic club is successful in the future
3998931 being in the spotlight is not something i am unaware of or have never experienced
3998932 the spotlight in my playing career was always there and as a national manager you had the nations hopes pinned on you
3998933 and when you are in the premier league like i have been the spotlight is on you all the time
3998934 i am a football person and just want the games to start i have come here with ambition and am aiming to take the club forward that is the message i want to get through
3998935 they are good opposition who are playing well at the moment
3998936 it will be a big test for us and not a walkover as some people might be in danger of thinking
3998937 they are a big strong physical side who have eight guys over six feet and we have to match that
3998938 we have a good draw and i think a good chance to go through but we must approach it professionally
3998939 you can lose to anybody they are professionals as well and will want to win the first leg at least
3998940 on a bad day if we are not concentrating then we can lose this kind of game so we must be careful and take it seriously we took odense seriously in the intertoto cup and that is how we should always be
3998941 i dont really like to talk about attitude because we are all professionals and get a lot of money to play football so we should go into each game with the right attitude there is no excuse for not having it
3998942 and if we can progress as far as possible in europe this season that will help the development of the team and the individual players
3998943 if he gets on the bus he has every chance of being picked
3998944 my favorite part of shards was cordelias struggle back home to simply go about her life
3998945 i think in barrayar cordelias true strengths came out in a hostile alien envirement where all the normal rules of conduct seem turned around she successfully manages to adapt
3998946 she may not be as strong physically as a barrayarn man but she proved conclusively she could be as ruthless
3998947 my only regret in having re read these is that im now going to have to find the time to go through the rest of the vorkosigan novels
3998948 i noticed mr m says aral reminds him of a young robert davi myself i picture more of a gregory peck
3998949 and yes i love that while aral is the man of honour and cordelia is careful and respectful of his honour in return he also recognises her honour and her worth and is careful and respectful of that
3998950 obviously i havent read all possible but in general i love the genre because it does focus typically on the people character realtionships and sociopolitical aspects simply mixing in sci fi aspects i find such stories seem more realistic and flow better
3998951 there was a brilliant juxtaposition of swords and daggers and plasma beams
3998952 betans were progressive socially and technologically when you see it through cordelias eyes it seems almost idyllic however when we are confronted with the reality of her world she found that it was in fact deluded and manipulative the converse is barrayan culture was seen as savage stuffy and antiquated but in reality was more honest and the people were more connected to one another it is little wonder that cordelia eventually made a home there
3998953 it may be a commentary on my inner psyche bothari was my favorite character his struggle with himself was both sad and touching in the end it is apparent that he is never going to be a whole person but he finds a place anyway
3998954 the other great thing about lmbs books is the humour displayed
3998955 the characters were interesting and realistic except maybe for the exceptionally crazy bothari and exceptionally sadistic vorrutyer
3998956 and while im at it for those who like the space opera genre i rather enjoyed elizabeth moons

3998963 carry this 180 lb brain damaged man around in order to get him the help he needed and the barrayan view of life which would consider someone dead even though the
3998964 a proper series is neither an extension of the novel as in the multi volume single story nor a replication as when essentially the same story is told over and over cookie cutter fashion but another animal altogether with its own internal demands
3998965 one must assume that readers will encounter the books in utterly random order each series novel must be simultaenously a complete tale in itself and uphold its unique place in the growing structure it must be two books at once
3998966 this seemed to indicate that betan antipathy toward the barrayaran people pre dated the war do ensuing books in the series touch on the development of the hostilities that touched off the seemingly inevitable conflict
3998967 in a little over a month from now well be wrapping our sets for yet another season preparing for next year

3998998 then by that time we have a change of government or weve gone through an election and everything gets stalled for another year and a half
3998999 what you dont want to be doing is waiting three years especially once the issue starts becoming public knowledge the last thing a business wants is not to be compliant on the day of the release
3999000 were going to first see the enforcement of policy internally and start training staff to be policy aware
3999001 in australia i really believe that the recommendations will be socialised by the time it gets to a bill format
3999002 at the end of the day is the government really going to sit down with business leaders i dont think so
3999003 there is an opportunity for government to take a lead and theres a great expectation that government will take the lead
3999004 in the us and uk theres a strong sense of liability
3999005 in the case of breaches here companies dont seem to fear it
3999006 big corporations here including isps are sending out malicious traffic and because there is no liability they dont seem to care

3999013 pet therapy has been recognized to help increase coping skills and decrease stress
3999014 i was stressed out the entire day over finals but the dogs came here and i am totally stress free right now
3999015 when im around dogs i dont have a care in the world
3999016 for the short term they break up the monotony and seem to have a calming effect
3999017 they were such a great help in getting me through that
3999018 this is the opening of the belly of the beast we said we are going to nail them we nailed them
3999019 they were a heavily armed gang but with the quick response of the police they had no opportunity to escape
3999020 das h ttest du doch auch anders sagen k nnen
3999021 the air force granted me leave to play in the cfl and now theyve deemed that my skills and expertise is at a high need
3999022 im a missile combat crew commander so basically i will be controlling the maintenance and security dealing with the nuclear missiles we have at our base
3999023 when he came into camp he showed some great skills and learned how to pass block which i was really excited about
3999024 as old as i am and being from the states weve been through a few wars since i started growing up in the 60s so yeah theres a huge trepidation
3999025 we received our suitcase only four days later besides having to buy clothing toiletries and other items we suffered anxiety and distress which greatly reduced our enjoyment from the trip we were afraid the suitcase would be lost and wed be left without our necessities
3999026 we had to submit a complaint and fill out various forms we lost a whole day of our trip and arrived at our hotel only that evening
3999027 on that flight two trolleys filled with suitcases were removed from the aircraft and placed in the baggage sorting area due to overweight the process is not our responsibility but rather that of the airline which knows the weight limitations of its planes
3999028 it wasnt a mishap or a mistake on our part
3999029 the janet jackson fcc incident could easily be lumped in with that
3999030 does it bother you that tina fey is still taking shots at you on 30 rock

3999032 i want to start exercising but i just cant figure out how to fit it in
3999033 its just like the 1990s when we spent nights on the streets shouting at the top of our voices
3999034 i dont think we are going to re ignite the cold war
3999035 president bushs decision to send aid to the people of georgia and americans stand united in support of the men and women who will carry out this humanitarian mission

3999048 its either gonna be called a twisted christmas or the twisted christmas a musical it tells a story but its very much a concert event but theres a storyline going on between the show is about 20 songs the band are the only actors there is a narrator i will tell you that much who fills in the spaces hes on video screen and he tells ala the rocky horror picture show to be honest he helps move the story along and tell the story if you saw hedwig and the angry inch off broadway a band performs and then in between there is interaction which further moves the story along so its pretty involved its a unique combination of things that have been done before and havent been done before and the goal really cause were not playing ourselves were playing a fictitious band in the musical eventually is to like the blue man group have a whole bunch of casts out there during the holiday season performing the show so thats the ultimate goal so its in development but its well on its way like i said i finished the script everybody loves it and now im sinking my teeth into writing the album which well start recording in january february for release in 2009

3999070 wir haben im ersten halbjahr 2008 mehrere neue kunden akquiriert darunter mit panda security auch einen internationalen gro kunden der innerhalb europas eines der wachstumsst rksten softwareunternehmen ist und ein entsprechend hohes umsatzpotential im online handel bietet
3999071 die solide steigerung unseres umsatzes die wir trotz dollarschw che und gebremster konjunktur erzielt haben stimmt uns f r das zweite halbjahr zuversichtlich in dem wir weitere abschl sse mit internationalen kunden erwarten

3999073 in the first half of 2008 we acquired several new customers among them also one large international customer panda security which is one of the fastest growing software companies in europe and offers a correspondingly high online distribution sales potential
3999074 the solid sales increase which we achieved in spite of the weak dollar and the slow economy makes us optimistic for the second half of the year in which we expect to conclude further contracts with international customers

3999078 we are looking back at a difficult second quarter which saw our efforts to improve profitability being undone by further cost increases at current long term projects integration measures at recently acquired group companies as well as delays of key project awards
3999079 i dont think it would be too much of a leap to say that you have the same sorts of problems with violence in pregnancy in australia
3999080 three quarters of the women who experienced violence during the pregnancy had also experienced violence from the partner prior to the pregnancy as well
3999081 it could be that if you are in a violent situation you are less likely to be sure that you want to have a baby

3999087 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle

3999096 selflessly to help improve the lives of the afghan people their spirits will live on in the continued efforts of all who are assisting in the reconstruction of afghanistan

3999102 we notified our commodity fund investors last week that the steep decline in natural gas and oil prices has had an adverse impact on our performance we continue to analyze the market and adjust accordingly
3999103 we have entered into a one year deal which is by mutual agreement given the blueprint for the new nbl in season 2009 10 and beyond remains to be finalised
3999104 both fox sports and the league see this agreement as a stepping stone to a longer term deal and we are grateful for fox sports continued support of basketball while we undertake the major restructure of the nbl
3999105 given the fact that we are currently undergoing a major review of our entire sport that is expected to see the face of the nbl change considerably in season 2009 10 this is a vote of confidence by fox sports in the future of our sport
3999106 basketball as a sport has made the difficult choice of undergoing some short term pain for the long term benefit of the sport as part of their commercial review and were excited about the future direction that has been mapped out
3999107 i think it is really a reward for the trade union leaders whove supported us and members who had to make substantial commitments to the future
3999108 they made big decisions in the 80s and 90s which i think has stood the nation in good stead really
3999109 and its a recognition of their contribution rather than me personally
3999110 you dont strive for recognition when you join something like the police force but the recognition is nice and i think it says a lot for the people ive been able to work with
3999111 he did it all for his electorate and he believed that was his role to represent his constituents and i think he did that in a very honourable and efficient way
3999112 you all would a brick if you ever saw me climb i mean if you all think this is amazing

3999117 thats once a day every day of the year how about you
3999118 sure once a day but ask the announcer if they were all with the same fat cow
3999119 but i can forgive you because it was not for your pleasure you did it
3999120 we cannot share further details on the pending approvals we have asked for some particulars and the moment they submit them we will issue r1 licence the first of three licences required to start operations
3999121 however there is still a long way to go as the micro insurance business represents a miniscule in the insurance industry though india can be called a leader in micro insurance
3999122 till recently micro insurance was driven by the government led social security schemes but now the time has come for an independent growth

3999124 i think there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic director picked the best voice and the best performer
3999125 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3999126 i dont agree with the decision because they are kids and it may scar them for life
3999127 the girl with the voice should have a chance to perform at the closing ceremonies it would be a great chance for her to redeem herself to the world
3999128 our customers deserve the best most reliable ssd the market can offer
3999129 what were providing our customers with flashback protection on the iodrive is a new level of assurance that should a chip fail their important data will be recovered instantaneously and without a loss in performance or capacity

3999133 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill
3999134 the idea that there is a state called happiness and that we can dependably figure out what it feels like and how to measure it is extremely subversive
3999135 deep economy the wealth of communities and the durable future
3999136 it allows economists to start thinking about life in richer terms to stop asking what did you buy and to start asking is your life good
3999137 for the time being we know that happiness fosters physical health but not precisely how
3999138 chronic unhappiness activates the fight flight response which is known to involve harmful effects in the long run such as higher blood pressure and a lower immune response
3999139 if we feel unhealthy we go to a medical general practitioner
3999140 if we feel unhappy there is no such generalist we have to guess
3999141 professional guidance for a happier life is unavailable as yet this is a remarkable market failure given the large number of people who feel they could be happier
3999142 we need a government that transfers power to the elected representatives of the people to carry out the peoples mandate for change
3999143 our people continue to face a profound humanitarian crisis this destructive policy of banning humanitarian assistance can be reversed with one letter
3999144 tragically zimbabwe has become one of the worst man made humanitarian disasters of a new and hopeful century
3999145 because of the failed policies of zanu pf five million zimbabweans now face starvation and famine we cannot allow this to happen
3999146 we knew negotiations would be difficult but a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
3999147 there is no way you can extract a bilateral agreement from a tripartite process
3999148 the leaders of our political parties must rise up to the challenge to provide leadership
3999149 is going to consult with the chinese regarding efforts to secure a strong verification regime and additional progress in the six party talks
3999150 he is expected to conclude his meeting in beijing over the weekend
3999151 i will discuss with assistant secretary hill negotiations with the north on how to draw up a verification mechanism
3999152 im also planning to discuss wrapping up the second stage of nuclear disarmament
3999153 we understand that japan and north korea agreed to the basic outline of a resolution to the abduction issue and to steps for eventual removal of some japanese sanctions on the dprk north korea
3999154 the entry price in some of our retirement villages is quite high
3999155 the arrangements for remaining in supported accommodation within some of the retirement villages is prohibitive there are some older canberrans who dont have the opportunity to seek out supported accommodation in some of our retirement villages and we want to address that
3999156 the model that i saw the village that i visited in richmond in virginia actually certainly sparked for me the possibility of us thinking more laterally about how to provide affordable accommodation for older canberrans in a supported and supportive environment
3999157 these days theres really nothing around thats under around about 350 000
3999158 its an enormous amount of money for people to come up with
3999159 i think it is really a reward for the trade union leaders whove supported us and members who had to make substantial commitments to the future
3999160 they made big decisions in the 80s and 90s which i think has stood the nation in good stead really
3999161 and its a recognition of their contribution rather than me personally
3999162 the workplace is like australia as a whole its changing its changing rapidly
3999163 what i think has been able to be demonstrated is that youve got to change with it and in some senses in advance of it in order to make progress
3999164 you dont strive for recognition when you join something like the police force but the recognition is nice and i think it says a lot for the people ive been able to work with
3999165 he did it all for his electorate and he believed that was his role to represent his constituents and i think he did that in a very honourable and efficient way
3999166 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
3999167 for another two days russian troops will remain in the gori region to transfer control to georgian police and then they will leave
3999168 we still have diplomatic relations with georgia we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia
3999169 but we wont directly talk to saakashvili we wont do that we offered him peace but not friendship
3999170 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3999171 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict

3999177 its the joys of international sport you mark someone who is world class and its something i really pride myself on my d mortlock odriscoll and guys like that it is tough but its part of the challenge i enjoy you need that experience to read the opposition attack and as you say de villiers is another world class centre and will be a handful wherever he plays
3999178 jean does that quite a bit in super 14 weve noticed on the tapes that quite often on defence he will move to outside centre and then on attack switch back to inside so its something we are used to with him
3999179 he orchestrates a lot of their attack so we will have to be on our toes but we are worrying more about what we have to do and i guess if thats affecting the game in any way then we will deal with it on the day

3999183 recruiting secret agents in the audience of the parade to mimic the extras in the movie as my ferris float approaches in order to fully reproduce the spirit of the scene i will need at least 100 agents on each block of the parade to get the ferris joy ball rolling
3999184 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
3999185 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
3999186 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
3999187 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3999188 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3999189 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3999190 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3999191 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

3999197 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
3999198 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
3999199 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
3999200 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
3999201 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
3999202 we have been under siege for the last two years
3999203 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
3999204 if the cease fire is just a front for extremists in gaza to rearm and regroup of course we have the right to act
3999205 any arms buildup is a direct violation of the calm that was achieved
3999206 they control the gaza strip with quite an iron fist if you dont mind me saying and none of this activity with the other groups would be happening unless hamas was complicit and allowing it to happen

3999243 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3999244 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3999245 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3999246 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3999247 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3999248 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3999249 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3999250 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3999251 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3999252 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3999253 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3999254 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3999255 the white population is older and very much centred around the ageing baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
3999256 the future of america is epitomised by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
3999257 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
3999258 look john kerry has been vetted he ran for president i think he would be a strong choice hed be a good choice especially in the context of foreign policy
3999259 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
3999260 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
3999261 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
3999262 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
3999263 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
3999264 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
3999265 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
3999266 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3999267 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
3999268 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
3999269 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
3999270 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
3999271 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
3999272 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
3999273 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3999274 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3999275 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3999276 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3999277 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3999278 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3999279 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3999280 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3999281 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3999282 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3999283 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3999284 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3999285 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3999286 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3999287 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3999288 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3999289 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3999290 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3999291 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3999292 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3999293 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3999294 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3999295 just so you all know we did set a record
3999296 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3999297 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3999298 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3999299 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3999300 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3999301 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3999302 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3999303 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3999304 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3999305 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3999306 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3999307 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3999308 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3999309 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3999310 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3999311 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3999312 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3999313 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3999314 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3999315 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3999316 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3999317 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3999318 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3999319 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3999320 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
3999321 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
3999322 these are all small things and they all add up
3999323 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3999324 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3999325 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3999326 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3999327 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3999328 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3999329 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3999330 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3999331 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3999332 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3999333 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3999334 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3999335 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3999336 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3999337 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3999338 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3999339 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3999340 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3999341 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3999342 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3999343 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3999344 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3999345 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3999346 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3999347 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3999348 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3999349 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3999350 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3999351 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3999352 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3999353 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3999354 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3999355 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3999356 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3999357 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3999358 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3999359 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3999360 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3999361 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3999362 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3999363 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3999364 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3999365 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3999366 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3999367 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3999368 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3999369 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3999370 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3999371 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3999372 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3999373 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3999374 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3999375 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3999376 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3999377 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3999378 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3999379 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3999380 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3999381 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3999382 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3999383 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3999384 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3999385 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3999386 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3999387 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3999388 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3999389 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3999390 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3999391 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3999392 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3999393 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3999394 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3999395 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3999396 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3999397 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3999398 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3999399 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3999400 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3999401 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3999402 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3999403 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3999404 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3999405 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3999406 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3999407 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3999408 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3999409 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3999410 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3999411 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3999412 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3999413 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3999414 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3999415 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3999416 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3999417 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3999418 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3999419 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3999420 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3999421 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3999422 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3999423 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3999424 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3999425 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3999426 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3999427 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3999428 these dress codes apart from being sexist can lead to foot and back problems
3999429 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3999430 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3999431 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3999432 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3999433 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3999434 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3999435 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3999436 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3999437 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3999438 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3999439 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3999440 police booked his ticket from ho chi minh city to london and i have already paid for the ticket on his behalf
3999441 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3999442 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3999443 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3999444 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3999445 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3999446 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3999447 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3999448 the collective programming of the mind which distinguishes the members of one group or category of people from another hofstede 1980
3999449 ooit moeten ze ergens bij een licht kleurtje begonnen zijn geel of zachtroze of zo maar door jaren van kruisen en aanpassen hebben we ondertussen al acht verschillende kleuren de zachtere kleuren blijven wel de basiskleuren en die gebruiken we dan ook het meest in het bloementapijt maar er zit ook donkerrood in en dat is een kleur die heel moeilijk te kweken is het experimenteren staat niet stil ze zijn zelfs nu al zo ver dat er geurbegonias bestaan geurend naar citroen misschien een ideetje voor binnen twee jaar
3999450 voor het tapijt gebruiken we de grote begonias want je kunt je wel inbeelden dat we met die kleine bloemetjes lang bezig zouden zijn om een tapijt te maken
3999451 ik lever ongeveer een tiende van alle begonias die nodig zijn voor het tapijt de rest komt van andere kwekers uit de omgeving het overblijvende deel van de bloemen dient voor andere tapijten in binnen en buitenland de rest het merendeel eigenlijk is reclame wij verkopen immers geen bloemen alleen bloembollen
3999452 de begonias worden eind januari begin februari gezaaid om dan in mei uit te komen dan worden ze in potten gezet in overdekte ruimtes om een maand later in volle grond en open lucht gezet te worden dan laat je de kwekers best met rust want met dat planten zijn ze toch wel een tijd bezig
3999453 zeven weken van s ochtends tot s avonds das het enige onderdeel van de kweek dat niet gemechaniseerd is
3999454 ondertussen is de architect van het bloementapijt al sinds het zaaien bezig met zijn ontwerp als de bloemen dan eind juli in volle bloei staan beginnen we onze vrijwilligers op te trommelen op hen vertrouwen we altijd een dag voor de constructie van het tapijt is het eindelijk zover plukken maar de volgende ochtend worden de achthonderdduizend bloemen naar brussel gereden waar ze op een middag in het juiste patroon gelegd worden leuk detail om op de grote markt te geraken moet onze vrachtwagen altijd een eenrichtingsstraat in de verkeerde richting in
3999455 het patroon is een maand voor de opening van het tapijt op ware grootte getekend op folie om bevochtigd op de grote markt opengevouwen te worden dit jaar is het wel een lastig motief om te schikken een frans tapijt uit de zeventiende eeuw cd veel krulletjes en zo voor de duidelijkheid het blauw in het tapijt zijn dahlias want blauwe begonias bestaan nu eenmaal niet en het groen das gewoon gras
3999456 altijd weer is het een huzarenstukje en altijd weer doen we ons uiterste best andere bloementapijten durven we soms eens te laten schieten brussel niet dat is te belangrijk voor ons het promoot onze sector enorm

3999459 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
3999460 since islam rejects people like me may i leave islam
3999461 now i know you are really crazy youre already in trouble with the authorities you want to court more trouble
3999462 i dont see what the problem is you and i and everyone here are subject to harassment all the time and constantly reminded that we are an abhorrent to the faith so why be part of a religion that rejects you
3999463 the authorities tell us that what we do is bad as we are men and
3999464 and on television you have male actors dressed in drag and playing
3999465 it doesnt help when a few ts also play up to the myth by being loud and crass
3999466 its how you carry yourself that makes people respect you i know people think im a snob but i could never let down my family
3999467 according to the investigation the van was at fault and violated traffic rules
3999468 elke dag doen we twee patrouilles van enkele uren in de duinen en op de stranden gebieden die voor onze collegas met de wagen of de fiets moeilijk te bereiken zijn en we helpen hen ook bij bepaalde evenementen zo komt er hier vanmiddag een koetsentocht voorbij die we zullen helpen oversteken
3999469 mensen zeggen ons weleens dat we een luizenbaantje hebben als ze ons zo zien maar ze vergeten dat we ook op ons paard zitten als het vijf graden is en als het regent en dat we ook ingezet worden bij betogingen of voetbal wedstrijden
3999470 grote problemen komen we hier zelden tegen meestal moeten we hondenbaasjes op de vingers tikken omdat ze hun dieren op het strand laten lopen of de hondenpoep niet opruimen de reglementen hieromtrent vari ren nogal van zone tot zone maar we worden voor de patrouilles gebrieft over het plaatselijke reglement
3999471 in toeristische gebieden wordt ook vaak gesluikstort en soms zien we in de duinen wel mensen die denken dat ze aan het oog onttrokken zijn zo zijn er hier enkele notoire afspreekplaatsen voor homos die zelfs vanuit de buurlanden afzakken om elkaar hier te ontmoeten het natuurgebied de fonteintjes whats in a name tussen zeebrugge en blankenberge is zon plek het domein is afgesloten voor het publiek maar geregeld wordt de omheining doorgeknipt naar het schijnt bestaat er op het internet een soort van roze gids waarin deze plekken allemaal vermeld staan
3999472 zo hebben we gisteren nog iemand betrapt die zes cannabisplanten in zijn tuin had staan
3999473 normaal gezien kun je niet over de tuinomheining kijken maar doordat wij een stukje hoger zitten konden we alles zien
3999474 de politiezones aan de kust zouden ons het liefst doorlopend hier hebben van half juni tot in september maar dat is nu eenmaal niet mogelijk gemiddeld hebben we twintig dertig manschappen beschikbaar voor dergelijke patrouilles tijdens de zomer daarom moeten we ons een beetje verspreiden zodat elke zone toch iets heeft want het gaat niet alleen om de kustgemeenten maar ook de ardennen de vele recreatiegebieden en openluchtzwembaden in het binnenland en natuurgebieden als de kalmthoutse heide we worden ook gevraagd voor evenementen als het folkfestival in dranouter en de vele festivalletjes aan de kust
3999475 daar moeten ze nog een beetje aan wennen nochtans worden deze paarden heel goed getraind om niet te schrikken van onverwachte geluiden en bewegingen hier valt het nog mee maar het carnaval van binche bijvoorbeeld is een van de moeilijkste evenementen om te paard te doen daarvoor moeten we onze allerbeste paarden inzetten
3999476 na al die jaren kweek je echt wel een band met je paard het is bijna als een tweede vrouw
3999477 i fast during ramadan myself and know that special measures need to be taken for the spectators for matches played during that month
3999478 i try and simulate as much of a game as i can its nothing personal what happened but it got my teammates going so thats a good thing
3999479 i broke a little too fast trying to make a play because i wasnt trying to do that
3999480 obviously he thought i was trying to hit him but i was just flying around we did talk after practice and cleared it up
3999481 i realized it wouldnt be a good idea to do that
3999482 kellen has his quirks but hes the most loyal teammate and the most trusted target you can have
3999483 from his first day at miami everything he did was full speed full go it might not always be right but it sets a tone
3999484 having a guy like that makes everyone better offense and defense because they feed off how competitive he is
3999485 those miami guys were always chirping at each other especially when we got down to the end of practice but it made them better
3999486 you can see the same is true here when kellen is going against linebacker willie mcginest that helps kellen and willie because theyre not going to go up against anyone tougher on other teams
3999487 i want to be great i dont want to be good
3999488 i dont want to be like everyone else i want to be the best
3999489 theres swelling in it and it wasnt getting any better so theyre going to go and take a piece of cartilage out
3999490 well see when he gets back and well go from there
3999491 we have been hit with a lot of injuries at that position and i dont know what we would do without dinkins
3999492 part of football is how you deal with it so well do that
3999493 we cant wait to get those guys back and see what we can do as a group
3999494 we dont want to be in the position we were in last season not controlling our playoff destiny in week 17 thats why were here working hard every day to make sure it doesnt happen again

3999499 to prevent the sort of mutiny they experienced from sepoys in 1857 the british organised religiously segregated regimental units from the alleged martial races i e sikhs pathans rajputs etc this severely restricted hindus of other castes particularly the khatris punjabi form of kshatriya who had served in maharaja ranjit singhs forces the khatris all sikh gurus were khatris were arbitrarily lumped together by the british as trading castes many families got around this artificially imposed caste barrier by raising one or more son as a sikh chiefly by having him adopt the name singh and grow hair or beard to match

3999525 how dare you i have thoughts and feelings and gears i may be an object but i am not some object for you to objectify
3999526 oh sorry i meant to say i dont care at all for your looks only your vibrant personality
3999527 ummm i have no opinion on your physical appearance whatsoever
3999528 are you trying to say im not memorable a girl wants to leave an impression on a fellow
3999529 youre leaving an impression on my face at least i didnt think talking to a clockwork girl would be this difficult
3999530 not complicated like a clockwork girl clockwork men are sturdy and simplistic not at all like a clockwork girl a clockwork girl like myself is a beautiful delicate intricate thing
3999531 if youre that fragile do you really think you should be doing that
3999532 oh i very much like music im just not in the mood for music right now
3999533 can you even eat an orange or even anything at all
3999534 but didnt you want to try to eat an orange
3999535 i changed my mind you can go ahead and have one though
3999536 i mean ever since you wound me up youve been very nice no ones ever been so nice to me before of course i dont remember ever being around anyone else before but im sure youre nicer than at least half of anyone else
3999537 let me ask you something else if you could pick who you could live with who would you pick
3999538 what makes you think anyone has a choice like that
3999539 you may think you have a choice but you dont
3999540 i suppose id pick a man who didnt want me
3999541 a man who wants me its only because he figures he needs me if he can admit that to himself on some level at least then he really doesnt need me at all a man who doesnt want me figures he doesnt need me without realizing he really truly does need me and i could help him realize that
3999542 thats that might be the most illogical thing ive heard anyone ever say
3999543 the guy who wants you is the guy who needs you right
3999544 but if a man who doesnt need you does in fact need you wouldnt that mean the guy who wants you might need you most of all
3999545 its okay not everyone can be as smart and emotionally sensitive as i am
3999546 you seem to want to know a lot about clockwork girls and me in particular why is that
3999547 id have figured a man would get a clockwork girl play with her for a bit then return her to her packaging forgetting about her letting her gather dust in a closet you on the other hand its like you oh whats the word
3999548 no thats not right oh never mind its just you take an interest and im not sure i know how to respond its like
3999549 you are fickle contrary mercurial and quite frankly completely frustrating conversing with you confuses me and might well cause damage to my self esteem i seem to grow more and more perplexed until i might burst and yet just before that happens you say something that makes me hope that youre not as flighty as you seem that maybe i mean something to you i look at you and it makes me think that there was something missing in my life that im so very close to finding whether i find it or not for better or worse i am glad to have met you and that youre here right now
3999550 im sorry my gears stopped were you about to say something
3999551 okay may i frolic about your living room for a bit
3999552 hey look at me i am special i want attention because i am insecure in everything i do i just want attention notice me
3999553 i cant see i cant hear i cant think i cant stand for too long i dont know why the lord doesnt take me

3999568 thats always the stand of the church in knowing the truth we will find out whats really the motive behind all these if it will bring good to the people or not

3999574 may be a way to keep president arroyo in power beyond 2010 because once you begin changing the constitution anything can happen
3999575 not even federalism could solve and we should be more careful in selecting our leaders because federal states will have its laws independent of each other

3999675 people need to realise that even virtual actions can have very real consequences
3999676 its becoming increasingly important that we keep our professional and social lives separate and manage our online reputation as effectively as possible
3999677 the question is not so much about the technology but what one does with it we have quite definite laws about where cctv can be used but of course with uavs you have much greater ability to gather material in private spaces and this would lead to concern
3999678 if they are used to simply hover to gain random information then that would obviously be a matter of worry and a civil liberty issue
3999679 closely involved with the development of procedures and regulations which allow uavs to operate in national and nato airspace but the committee indicates that the ministry should do more
3999680 in the response to our report we expect the mod to set out why it supports the astraea programme only in an observer role and its future plans with regard to this programme
3999681 satellite images can be affected by clouds and lack of light with uavs you can avoid that by choosing the height at which you fly there is now also google earth but these are often old images out of date there is tremendous potential in material gathered by uavs
3999682 there will obviously be implications for privacy human rights etc that is something the government will have to address and i imagine that there will be protests from some quarters but you certainly cannot blame police and intelligence services for wanting to use them
3999683 a mistake was made in the beginning of the debate we began to ball up our fists at each other without knowing what it is we were fighting about
3999684 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent

3999690 this is a victory for californias students parents and education community
3999691 i hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and homeschooled children once and for all in california but assures them that we as elected officials will continue to defend parents rights
3999692 california impliedly allows parents to homeschool as a private school but has provided no enforcement mechanism given the states compelling interest in educating all of its children and the absence of an express statutory and regulatory framework for homeschooling in california additional clarity in this area of the law would be helpful
3999693 we want parents to have the freedom to homeschool but we dont want children to become captives in a homeschool that doesnt prepare them for work or civic engagement as a functioning adult

3999800 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3999801 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
3999802 for another two days russian troops will stay in the region to carry out procedures of handing over control functions to georgian law enforcement bodies after which they will leave
3999803 all buildings are in normal shape the town is supplied with water and electricity
3999804 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbors that what it thinks about u s policy

3999813 this has a lot less to do with what is going on in california and more to do with what is going on in ohio pennsylvania and florida the big swing states

3999818 for us to break the record by so far is amazing i really look back to sitting back and cheering for the aussies
3999819 i did my best and ran out of room at the end
3999820 it definitely gives me more motivation im a little bit tired and i have a full day to recover
3999821 i cant believe it after the relay i could have sunk but i told myself that after all these years of hard work i cant let myself go down my legs were shaking at the start i was really tense just like the other seven guys
3999822 its a new generation and its now time to step aside they did a great job im from the previous generation
3999823 i was so calm that i think i could have seen each face in this venue
3999824 so to go out there and accomplish a medal is really exciting it doesnt top the relay medal but its something ive been pushing for for years

3999830 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3999831 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3999832 ormai abbiamo deciso la raccolta delle firme e la faremo ma non mi sembra una grande genialit
3999833 its very evident you can see that so its definitely something that weve got to push through right now
3999834 if i can go out there and play then i can go out there and play if something hurts something hurts ive got to try to get to the bottom of it i didnt sign a one year deal im looking more for the long term rather than a quick fix
3999835 were going to get this last opinion on it and he can be a guy who can possibly play very little or not at all
3999836 he looks to be in the right frame of mind lately and so if we can continue to work on that and push that its going in a positive direction
3999837 that way i can be on a long play drive and be out there for eight nine 10 plays is my goal
3999838 so im just like ooooohh and the wind wasnt even blowing

3999851 i have not seen a great willingness yet by these companies to do that
3999852 people are going to be quite busy with this load
3999853 you can be assured people are using the viewer to share information with partners customers and internally given the popularity of the office suite and how much businesses tend to use access
3999854 given that the vulnerability is web based and graphical you definitely want to pay some special attention to that one
3999855 it allows attackers to invite people for audio or video conferencing by impersonating a victim
3999856 there was an odd bug causing some security patches not to be deployed into areas of organizations
3999857 you want to make sure your wsus server has been patched
3999858 this is a company that clearly has designs on that market space
3999859 i think thats a little bit too soon because youve got to give these guys some time to digest the change
3999860 for power constrained datacenters and weve talked to a few clients who are worried about breaking things because theyre pushing the limits of their power so hard there is definitely some value in it
3999861 but for just a server farm where youre talking about tens or hundreds of nodes theres not as much value as there would be with a desktop virtual infrastructure where you might be talking about thousands of nodes that could be shut down overnight when theyre not being used
3999862 we see the ftc as absolutely critical but the states should be partners in this as well
3999863 if we had all hands on deck we could really make some progress in addressing this problem
3999864 there must be a recognition that online fraud is a huge threat to consumers as well as a threat to online commerce
3999865 fire eagle is a way for people to take their location to the web
3999866 essentially fire eagle is nothing more nothing less than a store for a users location
3999867 whats more interesting is how it works as a switchboard
3999868 fire eagle solved all the hard problems with location for us
3999869 it makes it easier for bloggers to have correct location information on their blog within their posts being able to geo tag their content
3999870 obviously fire eagle is crucial to the success of what were trying to do
3999871 there are other tools that identify location but none that do it in specifically this way
3999872 the attention to privacy is noteworthy as is the concept behind fire eagle the challenge will be to build user awareness and adoption in the near term
3999873 investing in the quality of the local public schools is essential if we are to maintain a safe thriving vibrant community

3999885 les acteurs du march chinois devraient se souvenir que lors de la cotation des premiers futures sur or au japon et aux etats unis dans les ann es 70 et 80 les volumes initiaux tait faibles mais plus tard ces deux pays sont devenus les principaux centres de n gociation des contrats aurif res il pourrait tr s bien se passer la m me chose sur le march chinois

3999888 le nombre de banques individuelles qui ont un tr s haut taux de concentration est encore plus significatif que ces statistiques g n rales sur le secteur
3999889 plus dun tiers des banques communautaires des etats unis ont des taux de concentration dimmobilier commercial qui atteignent plus de 300 de leur capital et presque 30 ont des pr ts de construction et de d veloppement qui d passent les 100 de leur capital

3999892 nous aurions tendance dire que tout nest pas n gatif

3999915 i cant believe it i know i was feeling down after the relay but i didnt want to get beaten
3999916 i have been working for years and years i didnt panic when i looked at the board i thought wow i did it
3999917 its a joy to be here i want to enjoy this moment today wasnt about the silver medal or the world record it was about touching the wall first
3999918 alain is an amazing competitor to bounce back from that relay takes a lot of guts and he showed that today full credit to him
3999919 he swam a better race and the better man won on the day
3999920 i am happy with a silver medal putting in that great relay and the world record probably took its toll im looking forward to the 50 now
3999921 its a new generation and now its time to step aside
3999922 its quite an extraordinary thing its the first time a preacher has convened the two presumptive candidates they are both fighting for that vote
3999923 mccain has a good record on that issue abortion and he must show that he will continue it as president
3999924 for mccain the aim will be to solidify evangelicals as a key constituency
3999925 for obama it is significant that he will be participating as an equal on the same stage as mccain in an evangelical church this signals the shift in the evangelical political landscape since 2004
3999926 this has a lot less to do with what is going on in california and more to do with what is going on in ohio pennsylvania and florida the big swing states
3999927 in all of these states there is a sizable evangelical population that does not directly identify with the old religious right
3999928 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
3999929 political stability in my view can only be brought through a reconciliation approach as opposed to confrontation
3999930 the era of repression is over forever dictatorship has become a tale of the past
3999931 the war against extremism and terrorism is a war for our own survival
3999932 i just wanted to win my heat i guess its going to be me and ryan in the middle tomorrow its fine its all i wanted to do
3999933 i wanted to set up for a middle lane tomorrow and then tomorrow is going to be the real battle
3999934 i feel fine i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can if i can do that ill be fine
3999935 those races are tiring but this is what i train for i feel a lot better just mentally and physically tomorrow morning will be a good one
3999936 i never came upon any of my discoveries through the process of rational thinking
3999937 i did say that the olympic games will help china open up and reform better
3999938 china is developing quickly people enjoy more freedom and they have a lot to say if you ask the ordinary chinese on the street they will say the same
3999939 you have to believe the majority of the people otherwise you are misled
3999940 that is the issue now and its what well debate
3999941 just to not make him play especially when i was serving for that first set
3999942 i dont want my kids running around in the street im scared for them this crime is out of control
3999943 im very saddened john was a young man with a lot of life i am sad for him and sad for his family and its sad for us as educators
3999944 some of the incidents involve alcohol drugs there are a number while a lot of people are running around trying to find solutions and organise talkfests i dont think anyone actually understands the problem its complex
3999945 the police do the best they can they work hard
3999946 yes we would like more but weve got to look at how we are using them are we using our police in the best possible way
3999947 he was a good kid i was very shocked and very surprised
3999948 its becoming a big thing in new zealand there are many children who arent taking up their full entitlement to education until age 16
3999949 we need to start with early education and its not subscribed in this area many young people arrive at primary school well behind
3999950 we have social workers in the school and we struggle to employ people there is a shortage of social workers often they have huge case loads
3999951 there will be no more flowers sent my loved ones are getting giant fortune cookies from now on

3999953 there will be no more flowers sent my loved ones are getting giant fortune cookies from now on
3999954 with photoshop elements im able to capture memories that are very special to me in my life and create beautiful works of art
3999955 after the semi finals my coach just asked me to strive for a better result in the final rather than setting a goal for me to win the gold medal
3999956 i was not thinking about winning two gold medals at two consecutive olympics
3999957 i know i was feeling down after the relay but i didnt want to get beaten
3999958 full credit to alain he swam a great race and really worked on my weaknesses i was maybe caught into swimming other peoples races
3999959 no complaints i am happy with a silver medal putting in that great relay and the world record probably took its toll im looking forward to the 50 now
3999960 we are not thinking about australia and thats an honest answer thats the best part about this team they really stay in the moment
3999961 theres no script that says australia and the united states are going to be in that gold medal game
3999962 but ive got great team mates theyre working their butts off
3999963 but neither i nor anne donovan feel like that we still have a lot of hard yards to do
3999964 if we could sneak in somehow and get a medal that would be great
3999965 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3999966 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3999967 we do not want there to be any potential misunderstanding or miscalculation
3999968 i really do believe that the russians understand that pushing the envelope here would have significant consequences for russias standing in the international system
3999969 that may have been the product of the fact that the europeans have more leverage with the russians on georgia than does the united states
3999970 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected its leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbors than what it thinks about u s policy
3999971 we think that mexicans and other immigrants should be warned if they cross into the u s they are putting their health at risk by leaving behind a healthier staple diet of corn tortillas beans rice fruits and vegetables
3999972 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3999973 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
3999974 for another two days russian troops will stay in the region to carry out procedures of handing over control functions to georgian law enforcement bodies after which they will leave
3999975 all buildings are in normal shape the town is supplied with water and electricity
3999976 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbors that what it thinks about u s policy
3999977 i never came upon any of my discoveries through the process of rational thinking
3999978 in order to beat him i have to run 9 6 most likely
3999979 this is what i trained my mind to do run 9 6
3999980 they expect us to go 1 2 and get the world record
3999981 i started with a bag and then a cooler now i have a backpack at home its been packed with red bulls and water on the road its been filled with twinkies starbursts snickers and skittles
3999982 its not like im going to go out there and change an approach or anything like that
3999983 im going to go out there with the same approach i normally do against a lefty and i think thats what astros manager would want me to do hes not going to want me to do anything different obviously hes put me there for a reason ill continue doing what im doing
3999984 hes tremendous against lefthanded pitching so this is the perfect opportunity i think for him to lead off he did it once before i think he actually got a base hit and a walk in the game he did it before hes swinging a real good bat right now so we hope were going to ride him a little bit
3999985 the appellants as indonesian citizens have constitutional rights which are not to be tortured
3999986 sometimes i lay in my bed and say i cant believe it i tell people every day people who know me or dont know just a blessing to me its unheard of or unreal im living in fairy tale land
3999987 for a kid coming up having dreams of football or basketball and then getting into boxing something i knew very little about and to get to the olympics and to get to feel what its like to represent your country i wouldnt trade it for anything in the world
3999988 we use the term bring the dog out from time to time when im in the ring and sparring i bark ha ha ha ha ha basically the coach released the leash on me
3999989 im looking at myself on that gold medal pedestal im not going to stop if my man thinks hes stronger im going to show him im stronger if he thinks hes faster im going to show him i can go the longest thats just how its going to be
3999990 every once in a while you take a day and you say hey were going to let there be a little more contact and tonight was one of those nights
3999991 the first day of camp a lot of times theyre excited about it but you have to understand every day is not going to be a super bowl you do want to finish and have the arrow going up
3999992 the preseason games are the only thing going on so theres a lot of analyzing every little thing what can we do better here or there
3999993 its a good time to look at yourselves and see what youre doing but in the grand scheme of things it doesnt mean anything
3999994 i dont think you can beat the guys up period and weve never done that
3999995 this year is no different than any other you go live but we dont hit our running backs
3999996 these numbers are obviously of special concern to the government as it the economy remains in a difficult time
3999997 by revealing the struggles we have they can really open patients eyes to how to interact with doctors they can connect patients and nurses who can be isolated from each other and they can be an important source of information for doctors as well as patients
3999998 its time for us to take some responsibility and really think of how we can maintain the integrity of this process
3999999 its an american and human fact that we project our self image through stress during these tough financial times that we buy and redesign and where our children grow up and to some measure it is our face to the community and to ourselves
