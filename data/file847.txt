8470000 causes or is likely to cause the average pregnant woman to take a decision in relation to the termination of her pregnancy she would not have taken otherwise
8470001 its common for cpcs crisis pregnancy centres to use misleading films ultrasound pictures and written materials to scare and emotionally manipulate women into continuing their pregnancies by presenting women with false information about abortion and the development of the fetus cpcs threaten womens abilities to make informed choices

8470004 some people thought we ought to wait until the postseason and that struck me as really being awkward
8470005 id rather go into the postseason knowing weve already used it to use one of my favorite lines this isnt einsteins theory of relativity we have the best technology you can possibly have and the procedures have been described in great detail i wanted to do it as soon as possible
8470006 the sport has a pace to it where you have to be very sensitive
8470007 even if this works well and theres no doubt it will its sort of like the wild card a few years ago first people criticized it and now they want more wild cards just because something works well you dont go on to do more
8470008 sure we could be farther behind but we could be ahead
8470009 it doesnt feel good to go out there and lose
8470010 especially when we know were better and were capable of doing a lot of good things
8470011 ive been bitten by the home run in the second half
8470012 i dont know what it is a lot of them have been the solo variety it gives our team a chance to stay in the game
8470013 you play this game long enough and you know teams are going to hit skids like this its just part of the game but its still frustrating to go through it
8470014 we have to worry about whats going on here if we take care of our business the standings will come out if we keep winning were not worried about the diamondbacks just like theyre probably not worried about us
8470015 the records not finished its supposed to be me and rihannas duet
8470016 its fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about you can write it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you but it might be an idea you have
8470017 so with rihanna that was an idea i had i just wanted to go totally left and kind of weird and thats what i threw at her
8470018 having the support of my fans on the second round was just incredible and its even getting bigger now
8470019 vamos retirar a medida provis ria agora eu tenho que ver o tr mite disso no pal cio do planalto assegurei ao presidente da c mara que n s vamos trabalhar para retirar

8470021 temos que ver quais os problemas que geram para n s
8470022 it is not unusual for players to be tested more than once it is not unusual for players to be tested more than once in a short period of time
8470023 the methodology we use in testing afl players is no different to that used in olympic sports and other professional sports
8470024 i was at the gabba four times and tested the same afl player three times
8470025 in rugby league i have seen the same players get tested again and again and again
8470026 perhaps jason akermanis is right from what i saw there is a very very good chance he was right
8470027 over the years ive had a few every now and then but no more than any other player
8470028 the afl has full confidence in the testing regime undertaken by asada for our sport
8470029 asada is the peak government body that tests not only the afl but every one of the 90 sports in australia be that olympic sports or sports such as ourselves rugby league and cricket
8470030 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8470031 tutto quello che capitato nei giorni passati va nella parte opposta
8470032 tutti ormai in occidente si pongono il problema di mettersi nei panni della russia
8470033 la ragione di stato ci ha reso complici nel dimenticare la cecenia
8470034 oggi la russia torna in una condizione di forza soprattutto per il suo profilo energetico
8470035 partnership interesse anche della russia e che nessuno vuole tornare alla guerra fredda
8470036 costruire una seria e nuova politica di partnership dal punto di vista occidentale con gli usa in primo luogo nella relazione con la russia
8470037 il primo impegno della futura amministrazione americana devessere quello di un lavoro comune
8470038 mettiamoci nei panni russi conclude casini ma anche nei nostri
8470039 comme le fut en son temps la sortie du livre en 2005
8470040 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8470041 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8470042 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8470043 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato
8470044 jackson hattiesburg laurel and all areas along the coast its a little mexico
8470045 im not against people trying to make living i have a compassion for those folks but at the same time the taxpayers of mississippi shouldnt be subsidizing a plant that wont even hire their own workers
8470046 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8470047 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken
8470048 i need a job and got kids i heard that they need some help now
8470049 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs
8470050 there is a russia narrative that we were weak in the 90s but now we are back and we are not going to take it anymore but being angry and seeking revanchist victory is not the sign of a strong nation it is the sign of a weak one
8470051 russia is going to have to come to terms with the reality it can either integrate with the world or it can be a self isolated bully but it cant be both and thats a choice russia has to have
8470052 they are kind of giddy they will need to sober up
8470053 when they sober up they will see that it is not the u s that has done things to them its that they have done things to themselves
8470054 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel economic and political losses
8470055 no one asked what impact its actions had on the russian stock market there was no russian stock market
8470056 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8470057 the georgian people won their freedom after years of tyranny and they can count on the friendship of the united states
8470058 three american presidents bush clinton and bush have all in their own way sought to encourage russias integration with the wider world this is a good thing it was the right set of policies
8470059 russia has now put all of that at risk because russian cannot simultaneously behave like the soviet union toward its neighbors like this is 1968 and act as if it is 2008 when it comes to the wto
8470060 there are areas where we have common interest with russia and we want to work with them the question is whether russia has an ability to work with us
8470061 it was an honor to receive this last year and its an honor to receive it this year thank you very much
8470062 maybe being in the limited edition sports car business is a luxury they cant afford
8470063 if it raises 400 million thats half a car program
8470064 after a while viper became an icon of its own
8470065 then it has to justify itself on a product and marketing basis
8470066 viper has a small loyal buyer base but like its motown brethren chrysler appears incapable of supporting a niche product
8470067 its another sign that theyre becoming more of a marketer
8470068 only 42 days thats pretty pathetic my home server running windows 2000 was rebooted this past spring try again
8470069 wait till you are stuck 300 000 miles above the earth without the ability to play wow
8470070 he seems to be uncowed and unapologetic about anything that is happening
8470071 im confident the final results will give us a primary victory and we can move on to the general election
8470072 as long as the hurricane has louisiana in its sights this is where ill be were still hopeful that the storm will miss us but weve got to prepare as if its coming our way
8470073 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8470074 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8470075 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8470076 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8470077 nobody knows i kind of left it on the table when to have it not even doctors can tell me that
8470078 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8470079 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defense
8470080 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field
8470081 its not a decision of anything else but me wanting to play football and whether thats a good decision or not im going to go out and try first to see what i want to do
8470082 it is something he has put an awful lot of time into and we are going to manage it and hope he can manage it and be ready to play
8470083 we are not going to put him on the field if hes not able to go out and perform and he is not going to want to be out there if he doesnt feel like he can perform
8470084 the days he practiced out here was going 100 percent he looked like shawne merriman to me
8470085 it is going to be something he has to manage i see him going out and playing playing on first and second downs and playing on third downs and rushing the passer if managing it means reducing his snaps at different times or picking specific situations where he doesnt need to be on the field that is what we will do
8470086 at the end of the 2007 season we had a lot of surgeries
8470087 shawne was on our list of players we had to discuss about surgeries we recommended to shawne with his knee that he have corrective surgery so he would be fine for the future it needed to be addressed one of the other options was to continue to play with a designed protective knee brace
8470088 my reaction is that hes our starter and hes a great player
8470089 hes a major part of our defense i hope he has a healthy productive year and i am very happy that he is back
8470090 i worry about his knee and about the health of all of the players on our team
8470091 you can not control injuries injuries are the biggest torment i have as a general manager all i hope for is the best its a physical violent game
8470092 man is born free and everywhere is in chain stores
8470093 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8470094 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8470095 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8470096 small and medium enterprises in australia have more confidence in alan carpenter and morris iemma than they do in kevin rudds government
8470097 mr swan and mr rudd talked up inflation and talked down the economy and they have undermined confidence and theyve undermined prospects for jobs prospects for business and prosperity
8470098 most businesses are now saying that demand is the issue that the economy is the issue that the current economic conditions are really making their business pretty tough at the moment
8470099 we are experiencing the first episode in history of reverse coupling in which the rest of the world pulls the u s forward rather than the opposite
8470100 the improvement in trade balance has accounted for the totality of u s economic growth over the three quarters
8470101 the most intelligent the most interesting the most comic and the least pat and formulaic of all contemporary australian films
8470102 is the owner of a swimming pool insulated from liability per se for a lifeguards negligence simply because the lifeguard is required to be there surely not
8470103 there would still be issues of negligence in hiring or supervision and of control the exact issues disputed here
8470104 has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose
8470105 we are no longer a christian nation we are also a muslim nation
8470106 it took a speech that i had made extolling faith and made it seem as if i had said that america was a muslim nation
8470107 whatever we once were we are no longer a christian nation at least not just we are also a jewish nation a muslim nation and a buddhist nation and a hindu nation and a nation of nonbelievers
8470108 i truly fear an obama presidency this guys so dangerous who needs al qaida
8470109 he is a shenanigan it was my fault for trusting him so i will pay for it
8470110 i certainly didnt want to completely slander somebody especially a guy that might be the next president then i get audited every year or something
8470111 i might have said can you put a subliminal shadow in i dont know that i said put devil horns
8470112 throwing noodles against the wall as to what could be done
8470113 an ad that was never paid for got more media than they could ever hope for
8470114 maybe you cant hear should we clean your ears out
8470115 its a movie called the heist that im doing with t i idris elba and matt dillon
8470116 im playing a killer im not going to give anything else away
8470117 its a bank robbing movie so its one of those action packed films you get a little different side of me in that movie
8470118 its a new age young hip hop version of heat
8470119 these are young cool well dressed articulate bank robbers chris be the little homey
8470120 is perhaps the greatest of all greek tragedies and the most read
8470121 99 cents i would have gladly paid a dollar the song sounds fucking amazing good work my friend

8470124 hey mike the tune rocks cant wait to hear the rest
8470125 feel hurt standstill movement encounter that contribute to ethos delightful
8470126 its not a great result at home when you should have done better
8470127 we gave away the ball way too much in the second half
8470128 a bit of lack of concentration could have cost us the game but we won and if we play well defensively down there theres no reason we shouldnt win
8470129 twelve houses between them two rich guys its almost like shooting fish in a bucket
8470130 s acepto la nominaci n para vicepresidente junto a barack obama
8470131 en los cr menes de estado es dif cil encontrar pruebas directas
8470132 bill clinton es un ejemplo de presidente que tiene a la gente como su primera prioridad

8470138 we know that there are many people on the gold coast and in north queensland who are looking forward to being involved in the hyundai a league from week to week
8470139 queensland is clearly a major area of focus for football our strategy is to invest in the growth of the sport and expansion of the hyundai a league into queensland is right for football
8470140 but an arrogant team not in a negative way an arrogant team in a way that we will go into every game with a belief that we can win it thats what i call positive arrogancy
8470141 do you know why clive palmer likes me because we both believe that if you go to play you go for a win so well go to win every game
8470142 in my time there we had no marquee player no big names on big wages no repeated red cards and the crowd was above expectations so the conclusion is that there is no substitute for good happy football
8470143 the last thing i want to do is shoot my mouth off and put the boys under pressure
8470144 but well be out there buying some really solid players we do have a real desire to try to be competitive as soon as we can
8470145 will my identity be stolen if the biometric templates are hacked into

8470149 they were the ones calling me every week and that was a big factor
8470150 i know there was a time when they were playing in the college world series it seems like theyre coming back as a program
8470151 he just wanted to get it out of the way i think hes relieved
8470152 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8470153 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8470154 intentionally recklessly and negligently providing extensive banking services to the palestine islamic jihad and to hamas which caused enabled and facilitated terrorist attacks
8470155 they were warned given the name of the hamas official and even given the dates and amounts of the transfers

8470160 slow strengthening is forecast once gustav moves farther away from haiti and the storm could regain hurricane strength within the next day or two
8470161 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8470162 as long as there is a chance that well be in this storm ill be here in louisiana

8470169 i dont really read fashion magazines or anything like that
8470170 i moved up there with no money and no friends and i didnt have a plan
8470171 just biologically this plant was designed not to require as much water
8470172 if we can conserve 50 percent of the water it only makes sense to do that
8470173 and if its good for mckinney there is no reason it wouldnt be good for our neighboring communities
8470174 maybe just maybe this will eliminate the need for one of those reservoirs
8470175 now thats huge youre talking literally about billions of dollars in savings

8470178 the regulations are close to what we already have in the zoning bylaw
8470179 two things have happened since weve placed them in the zoning bylaw we have some experience because currently kool breeze farms is installing a wind turbine under these regulations
8470180 the regulations in the draft copy we have now improved some of the language so its a lot clearer
8470181 so weve made some modifications and adjustments so that we have reasonable distances
8470182 i drove down last year and watched them land tuna and i was tied to the wharf at the time
8470183 the word is out if they want to have a meeting they should be calling in
8470184 people are more impressed by the power of our example not the example of our power
8470185 this has meant sap customers have had to compete for a limited supply of skilled contract resources which is certainly not in the customers long term interests
8470186 we will be investing heavily in canberra and building upon the solid base of current phase iii personnel and capability
8470187 we are committed to having the best people available to canberra clients from within canberra supported by our international network where necessary
8470188 he is right the amount of energy we get from solar and hydroelectric energy is simply not enough especially in a value cost relationship

8470193 the hub of public service support to the prime minister and cabinet and its decision making structures
8470194 god fucking damn it why isnt the whole fucking game like this
8470195 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8470196 yes he can but we have to elect him first
8470197 are you kidding me folks talk about being for it before youre against it before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8470198 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8470199 always said russia was more scary than the united states
8470200 in evidence the committee heard that the proposed luxury car tax surcharge was bad policy for a number of significant reasons senator abetz said
8470201 it is the politics of envy which will increase inflation it will damage the australian automotive industry no other so called luxury goods are taxed and motor vehicles and their uses are already very heavily taxed almost 70 per cent of vehicles sold annually which are subjected to the lct are sold for less than 75 000 not the cars of millionaires
8470202 labors only rationale for this tax increase is to increase revenue and supposedly fight inflation yet even labor senators concede it will be inflationary in their majority report he said
8470203 i had a vision from god that told me to become a politician
8470204 to love one another and treat others the way you would want to be treated
8470205 not persuaded by mohawks argument that once the privileged material is turned over the cat is out of the bag and the damage is done
8470206 the reason he carpenter was terminated we believe relates to our case because ultimately it had to do with whether mohawk was employing people who could not lawfully work there
8470207 we of course are eager to learn what really happened whats important to us is the reason why he was terminated what he complained about and what the companys response to his complaint was
8470208 as a result of mr carpenters misconduct mohawk fired mr carpenter and did not give him any severance package
8470209 his attempt to knowingly cause mohawk to obtain and utilize an unauthorized worker blatantly violated mohawk policy
8470210 in fairness evaluation of those representations will require an examination of otherwise protected communications between attorney morillo and carpenter and between attorney morillo and defendant mohawks personnel
8470211 if this court were to determine on appeal from a final judgment that privileged information was wrongly turned over and was used to the detriment of the party asserting the privilege we could reverse any adverse judgment and require a new trial forbidding any use of the improperly disclosed information as well as any documents witnesses or other evidence obtained as a consequence of the improperly disclosed information
8470212 no other adequate means are available to remedy a clear usurpation of power or abuse of discretion by the district court mohawk has not shown that either occurred here
8470213 while were disappointed in the decision reached by the 11th circuit it obviously has nothing to do with the merits of the case we are confident that mohawk will ultimately prevail in this litigation and this discovery battle will not impact that result
8470214 under this ruling they the defendants will be required to produce documents and information that we feel will be very helpful to our case
8470215 i dont see any evidence of remorse or concern for anyone but himself
8470216 i do feel deep remorse and would like to apologize to any customer who ever had a bad experience with my company
8470217 i apologize to all the great people the employees of berkeley theyve given their heart and soul i let them down
8470218 it probably will take some years before that is accomplished
8470219 the time i have left id like to spend with them i dont think its fair to take me away from them
8470220 thats the alternative a hook and release sports fishery it will be a tourist centred business
8470221 that she doesnt say excuse me i bet you she will just walk right into me and ill just stop
8470222 the term is excuse me if you use this term people will get out of your way
8470223 the term is excuse me right did anyone ever teach it to you
8470224 lets just walk right in the middle and when people are coming down with their carts lets just walk directly towards them and see if they say excuse me first
8470225 they usually dont start till 10 30 p m and theyre there till three in the morning
8470226 im just scared that theyll come and slash our tires im hoping saying something might make the parents of these kids realize whats going on
8470227 when theres places to hide it seems like theyll frequent those parks its just kids looking for a spot to hang out and theres been some minor disturbances sometimes theyll set a small fire to warm up
8470228 for the purposes of this shift we werent able to obtain the services of a locum
8470229 for an athlete to be successful in the sport entertainment business we live in today they need to perform on and off the field of play and communicating effectively is a big part of that
8470230 we are a u s based tour and the majority of our pro am players our fans our sponsors speak english
8470231 but they were definitely frustrated when they didnt have a similar experience of a year before when they were with a player who spoke english
8470232 its unfortunate the lpga has to create a policy to force players to do something that they should want to do on their own
8470233 i would 100 support a program that helps foreign born players
8470234 but to threaten them with suspension i dont understand why they are going about it as a program of punishment rather than reward
8470235 he brings a great approach from front to back he sees all 11 guys thats what i think as a defensive coordinator your responsibility is
8470236 mikes very no nonsense and theyve responded well to that
8470237 its a hard playing group its just that they havent been consistent
8470238 the real positive i found when i first got here is all these guys are good guys who want to win
8470239 marvin re enforced some things swarm to the ball pad level footwork
8470240 mike cut his teeth as a secondary coach so technically in the back end weve improved tremendously
8470241 we already had some talented guys now you see it happening on the practice field
8470242 were not were more in your face more man zone blitz
8470243 you just have confidence that theyre going to make people have to go 80 90 yards and not give up 60 yard chunks
8470244 when were healthy we have as much talent as anybody needs to get to the super bowl
8470245 nobody expects much out of us and thats a good thing its just the opposite of cleveland where everybody expects them to be good
8470246 i hope a democrat doesnt win more tax breaks for the poor great idea lets just give them everything wait throw in some free health care as well doesnt this already exist its called communism and it doesnt work
8470247 to talk to our enemies and consult with our allies
8470248 thats why we are here and we are proud to stand with him as he leads the fight for a smarter and tougher foreign policy so that we can finally end the go after the terrorists who attacked us on 9 11 and defeat them where they are strongest in
8470249 i suspect don would but unfortunately most americans would not and if we remove that kind of support strategem then you remove the entire reason for having any kind of projects programs initiatives
8470250 theres 30 games left and we dont want to lose key players to injuries
8470251 if we were later in the season and we absolutely absolutely needed to win the game then id want abreu to go all out
8470252 some players would chase that ball right into the wall but its much too early theres too much baseball left to play and we need bobby for the stretch drive
8470253 some people might have been counting us out but when were down by 9 thats when were most dangerous they had to find out the hard way ha the joke was on them i guess
8470254 senator currie in my opinion is guilty of making a terrible mistake
8470255 knowing him i believe it was absent mindedness still he lobbied the government on behalf of a private entity for personal profit
8470256 guilty of violating ethics laws and unfit to serve in the state senate
8470257 senator currie is going to remain chairman through all of these difficult budget negotiations
8470258 and if in fact he is charged by the federal government then we will look at it again
8470259 please note there might be duplicate districts and groups names in different geographies
8470260 please note there might be duplicate districts and groups names in gt different geographies
8470261 we need wins to move up the table and to give us confidence
8470262 were absolutely convinced that we have the right man for the job and that were heading in the right direction we have absolute patience
8470263 im not worked up all im completely calm we drew ten times last year and we ended up champions by ten points
8470264 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8470265 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8470266 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8470267 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8470268 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8470269 una cosa es la decisi n judicial y otra lo que pas
8470270 unless the state of texas violates their own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot
8470271 both parties filed before the deadline we expect their amended filings after both parties finish their nominating process at the conventions
8470272 my job demanded a lot and i gave it 100 percent
8470273 i kept up with every one of my male co workers
8470274 affected my familys quality of life then and they affect my retirement now
8470275 we cant afford more of the same votes that deny women their equal rights
8470276 equal pay for equal work is a fundamental american principle
8470277 todays ruling clearly rejects the white houses efforts to run out the clock on the committees investigation of doj politicization this congress
8470278 a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the absolute immunity issue
8470279 there may result a danger to the national security of the united states interference with a criminal counterterrorism or counterintelligence investigation interference with diplomatic relations or danger to the life or physical safety of any person
8470280 why isnt the appropriate thing to say that congress here used in a first amendment sense language that simply goes too far
8470281 a special agent in charge is not someone who is directly responsible to the people
8470282 there is no suggestion that plaintiff chose to buy the securities based on misinformation about the nature of the investment
8470283 the cfa is broadly worded to protect consumers from a wide variety of deceptive practices in connection with the sale of merchandise
8470284 the language of the cfa evinces a clear legislative intent that its provisions be applied broadly in order to accomplish its remedial purpose namely to root out consumer fraud
8470285 is this hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one 30 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength 31 the second is this love your neighbor as yourself there is no commandment greater than these
8470286 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
8470287 im not a racist and i resent the implication i would vote for a black man in a minute but this guy look who he hangs out with all known racists and radicals therefore i would vote for this guy if he were older and more experienced and didnt hang out with racists but i could never vote for someone with such racist affiliations
8470288 you mean i have to sit here for six minutes before you pump gas he was told
8470289 oh my michelle wiped her tears when bidens son spoke well that should convince us to vote for obama im not impressed
8470290 look into the situation and contact me if she had any questions
8470291 first of all let me tell you this lets get this straight
8470292 it really isnt so much about alex but j t s performances have been so unusual i think alex is fine he hasnt done anything to discredit him as a starter or to say that he cant play thats not been the issue at all we had an opportunity to give these guys a day off with their arms and j t stepped in and did some remarkable things so we decided to take more of a look at him the more we gave him the better he did
8470293 its hard with josh because hes a rookie and hes never been the tempo of a regular vs preseason game is substantially different
8470294 to play under that pressure all of the sudden the lights are shining the timing isnt like it was in the preseason because you are a little panicky and theres that growth process you are trying to fight through so to say that josh is the guy who is going to start hes in it obviously but we are really kind of planning on bj bryant johnson to step up and be healthy and get ready to go
8470295 im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk
8470296 but when its calvin klein and its fashion photographer steve meisel shooting you and you get to be a part of this amazing iconic brand and their legacy you just kind of go for it
8470297 i love comfort and ease i think you aussies are great at that
8470298 i like to walk by the store and have something catch my eye and then go in but i dont like to do the whole hour long im not a girl girl in that way
8470299 but i always kind of feel like you have one life to live so you cant hold back
8470300 we had a goal line running drill early in camp and i tell you hes a load he may be a really nice change of pace to some of our smaller backs we can put him in and let him hammer the ball a little bit
8470301 he kind of got lost in the shuffle after mason left and he came in and said he didnt know what to do said former glencoe silver lake coach dave dose
8470302 i said jon what do you want to do he said i want to go the u and give it a try and i told him hed just answered his own question
8470303 theres some stuff where i feel a little rusty hoese said
8470304 he was an incredible high school running back dose said
8470305 you give him the ball and hed just drag people and break tackles and the sight the average fan might not have seen was the blocking he literally put linebackers on their backs
8470306 a few times with hoeses love of snowmobile racing the good news for brewster is that hoese said hes put the snowmobiles on hold until the end of his college football career
8470307 im not going to lie though i do miss it hoese said
8470308 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8470309 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8470310 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8470311 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8470312 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8470313 when it was shown to him he was very very pleased indeed
8470314 he could only widen his eyes or something like that but it was explained to him and he was thrilled
8470315 it probably did as much as the injections they were giving him
8470316 doctors dont usually make predictions but they are predicting that within three days they will be able to feed him solids and that should build up his strength
8470317 i cant refute the ugly truth about niggers so ill hurl
8470318 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8470319 say barack hillary won 18 million votes why didnt you even consider her for vice president just askin bud
8470320 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
8470321 it was not only required as a good catholic to abhor and avoid abuse of power but to do something to end that abuse
8470322 i get comfort from carrying my rosary going to mass every sunday its my time alone
8470323 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
8470324 a person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae
8470325 there are those who say that catholics should be robots theres a formula
8470326 if i were an ordained priest id be taking some issue with some of the more narrow interpretations of the gospel being taken now
8470327 but my church is more than 2 000 years old theres always been a tug of war among prelates and informed lay members

8470334 i came to work this morning which is option expiry day saying wed be up 40 points and were up 46 at the moment so im happy with that he said
8470335 i think we saw bhp and rio both up in the uk and new york so we had a little bit on our side when we made that forecast and option expiry usually steadies the market anyway
8470336 you have no expression you laugh even you are not happy
8470337 50 gold medals are not enough to make up for his withdrawal in beijing
8470338 of course im pleased with the result but im disappointed also because gerrard will have an operation tomorrow on a groin problem
8470339 we knew he would be like this because he has had that problem for a while he has to do this now because he has pain and he had it when he went away with national team
8470340 we knew he had the problem in the first leg and yesterday our doctor talked about this situation steven said he would play with pain and afterwards he would have the operation today was ok he kept going because he knows hes going to the surgeon tomorrow its not very serious but he has pain so we needed to do it
8470341 has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose
8470342 in times past people may have a wish list of things they want to do with their house
8470343 now theyre kind of whittling that down to what they have to do or need to do to keep repair work from turning into big jobs

8470349 he was sworn in at the hospital at my bedside
8470350 i am happy because we have played two games and won two games but it is difficult
8470351 we now have a big derby on sunday and all the teams are very good
8470352 hopefully weve got all the injuries at the start of the season and we can get everyone back fit more or less after the international break
8470353 in a way its fallen nicely for us having only two league games in the first four or five weeks of the season when weve got a few injuries
8470354 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8470355 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8470356 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8470357 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8470358 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8470359 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8470360 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8470361 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8470362 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8470363 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8470376 dia mengaku kepada kami saat di kepolisian tubuhnya dipukuli polisi sehingga terpaksa mengakui perbuatan yang sebenarnya tidak dilakukannya kasihan sekali dia

8470380 what good is voting if all i can choose between is and a turd sandwich
8470381 no matter how much you try to link bush and mccain they are not the same
8470382 senator mccain has proposed substantial tax cuts offset only very partially by proposals to broaden the tax base
8470383 more government debt eventually translates into higher interest rates which discourage business investment and consumers demand for homes and such durable goods as automobiles or alternatively into increased debt owed to foreigners which mortgages the nations long term economic future
8470384 someone tell me based on this image alone why i shouldnt
8470385 my income dropped to below the standard deduction so now i pay no taxes thanks obama
8470386 within the top 5 only the top 1 will actually see tax increases and those tax increases will be minor
8470387 i want to pay more so my boss will be happy
8470388 your obama tax cut is you will probably not get an obama tax cut
8470389 im going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by 20
8470390 i only saved a dollar too its unfair that he got ten times more than i
8470391 why should he get 10 back when i got only two the wealthy get all the breaks
8470392 we didnt get anything at all the system exploits the poor
8470393 john mccain would tax you xxx xx more than barack obama
8470394 but if there were no wal mart where would you buy groceries you should just be thankful that they provide you with all the shopping lanes and food you will need
8470395 you tax us when were born you tax us when we die you tax us when we eat you tax us when we sleep get off our backs
8470396 my income dropped to below the standard deduction so now i pay no taxes thanks obama
8470397 pretty soon you may actually have a 50 hour minimum wage but a cup of joe will also cost you about 50
8470398 in about 6 weeks the minimum wage will go up to 50 per hour
8470399 so according to your interpretation of obama nomics we will all have to work for about an hour for a cup of joe pretty soon

8470422 tudo que aprendi em oito anos anos de presid ncia e tudo o que ocorreu depois nos estados unidos e no mundo me convenceram que barack obama o homem para este trabalho
8470423 obama tem uma habilidade impressionante de inspirar as pessoas de aumentar nossas esperan as e de nos unir para um prop sito maior ele tem a intelig ncia e a curiosidade que qualquer presidente bem sucedido precisa
8470424 barack obama vai nos afastar da divis o e do medo destes ltimos oito anos para nos fazer reencontrar a unidade e a esperan a

8470429 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8470430 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8470431 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8470432 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8470433 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8470434 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8470435 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8470436 who are open to doing something on the production side
8470437 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8470438 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8470439 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8470440 before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8470441 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8470442 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8470443 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8470444 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8470445 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8470446 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8470447 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8470448 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8470449 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8470450 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8470451 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8470452 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8470453 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8470454 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8470455 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8470456 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8470457 there are no plans that i know of to change the agreement but you know in life you never rule things out
8470458 but its obviously got to be something that both the united states and india you know can agree to if there were going to be changes but ive heard no mention of a need to you know adjust the agreement in any way
8470459 we are aware that the congressional clock is ticking and we are going to be consulting with other governments particularly governments in the nuclear suppliers group to try to move this process forward as quickly as we can
8470460 there are a number of concerns that some countries have about whats been about the agreement but they are good questions and we think weve got good answers to those
8470461 we have assured him that anti china activities will not be tolerated and that nepal is committed to its one china policy
8470462 i love that song and i adore imran khan i think hes going to be a huge star he and ranbir are my current favourites in fact i told ranbir how much i like imran no he didnt mind at all ranbir and i are friends after bachna ae haseeno
8470463 some people you jell with others you just do your job with katrina is one of those cases we were just professionals on the sets but there was no rivalry or anything
8470464 we were both working for the same film not at cross purposes we were both liked in race though people would like to believe otherwise there was no negativity or animosity between us there was no dramatic tension on the sets were both too sensible for that there was just no scope for one to one interaction
8470465 id love to complete the film right now im going through a phase when im searching for roles ive no idea what i want but yes id like to do an author backed zany fun filled film at the same time i love multi starrers theyre more fun on the sets
8470466 lots of unfulfilled wishes before i give up acting if i dont like whats being offered i wont sign anything for now my last film is freeze with neil nitin mukesh
8470467 shes really sweet johns brother and anka were seeing each other for three years beyond that i wouldnt like to say anything about them let them lead their own lives
8470468 key to the lock of the wto deadlock is not in our hands the key is with the developed countries
8470469 we cannot minimise any of those issues and make a wrong headline the headline issue is subsidies headline issue is the product specific caps
8470470 let us make sure that this pause is a useful pause
8470471 never fail they only pause that is how i perceive it
8470472 seek an injuntion as soon as next month to stop mga from making more bratz dolls
8470473 im still just waiting to wake up from this whole nightmare
8470474 this is the scariest thing ive ever been through in my life
8470475 without a doubt that was one of the worst days of my life
8470476 ive been coaching for nearly 28 years and ive never seen anything like it we tried talking to her and it was like she was looking right through us
8470477 i remember being on the bench and having a really bad headache and not being able to talk
8470478 i turned to go onto the ice and the next thing i knew i was falling down on the bench i remember everyone trying to talk to me i was frustrated because i couldnt talk to them i knew something was wrong but i didnt know what
8470479 there are so many specialists and doctors looking at her because this is so rare
8470480 i mean this just doesnt happen to a healthy 12 year old so they still dont have the answers they tell us that sometimes they never find out were just sitting watching and waiting
8470481 her right arm wont move at all but her right leg is moving so much better her smile is all the way back and she can talk up a storm now shes eating really well but shes still in the woods
8470482 the brain gets worse before it gets better is what the doctors are telling me she is having no physical therapy yet because they dont want her blood pressure to go up at all theyre pumping her full of steroids to try to reduce the swelling were just praying all its going to take is medication i have to put all my trust in these people theyve been so incredible to me
8470483 it helps me a lot that my friends and family come around to make me happy
8470484 a picture of a picture or a photo of his work or a print of a photo
8470485 a wealth of information about warhols process and his interactions with his sitters
8470486 through his rigorous though almost unconscious consistency in shooting the true idiosyncrasies of his subjects were revealed
8470487 the two pictures would be taken at the same time but maybe at different moments
8470488 by presenting both kinds of images side by side the photographic legacy program allows viewers to move back and forth between moments of warhols art work and life inseparable parts of a fascinating whole
8470489 we are delighted to be among the selected art museums and collecting institutions around the country to be honored by the warhol foundation through their legacy collection program
8470490 the way i see it the real long term problem facing markets with significant amounts of holiday properties is going to rear its head when retiring baby boomers start dying off lots of people croaking plus very few in a position to buy their second homes potential problems worthy of further analysis
8470491 i just heard some great news youre going to be in my class i hope youre as excited as i am about 3rd grade were going to have a great year together
8470492 dengan pengalaman dan kebijaksanaan joe biden yang mendukung pemahaman barack obama yang hebat dan insting yang bagus amerika akan memiliki pemimpin keamanan nasional yang kita perlukan
8470493 saya ingin kalian semua yang mendukung dia hillary untuk memilik barack obama pada november
8470494 semua yang telah saya pelajari selama delapan tahun sebagai presiden dan pekerjaan yang telah saya lakukan di amerika dan seluruh dunia telah meyakinkan saya bahwa barack obama adalah orang untuk pekerjaan ini
8470495 bagi bk nggak ada persoalan sebab ada surat dari pimpinan dpr kepada kpk agar menerima bk untuk berkoordinasi surat itu bentuk lain dari permintaan pimpinan agar bk melakukan pengusutan
8470496 sebelumnya mereka menolak diperiksa di kpk dan meminta diperiksa di dpr tetapi kami telah memutuskan memeriksa mereka di tahanan dengan alasan keamanan

8470498 lelaki yang mempunyai kaki yang besar tidak semestinya mempunyai alat kelamin yang juga besar teori itu tidak berasaskan saintifik
8470499 justeru kebolehan meramalkan saiz penis dengan cara melihat saiz kasut yang dipakai oleh lelaki tidak lebih dari sekadar satu salah tanggapan
8470500 seks penting dalam perkahwinan baik lelaki mahupun wanita mempunyai pendapat yang sama tentang ketegaran ereksi dalam menjamin kepuasan seks
8470501 dari perspektif wanita ereksi yang lebih baik yakni tegar dan lebih lama adalah lebih memuaskan
8470502 hanya kira kira satu perlima lelaki yang benar benar berpuas hati dengan ketegaran ereksi mereka
8470503 sebanyak 16 peratus wanita pula melaporkan tidak begitu seronok dengan ketegaran ereksi pasangan masing masing
8470504 meskipun lebih dari satu pertiga rakyat malaysia tidak berpuas hati sepenuhnya dengan bilangan kekerapan mengadakan hubungan seks tetapi dari sudut mencapai kepuasan kita masih pada kadar yang tinggi 42 peratus jika dibandingkan dengan peratusan dunia 50 peratus
8470505 sesuatu yang dapat dirumuskan adalah bilangan kekerapan tidak semestinya melambangkan kualiti
8470506 hasil kajian gbss menyatakan bahawa kaum lelaki mempercayai yang pada satu satu ketika dalam kehidupan mereka semua lelaki akan mengalami ketidakpuasan dengan ereksi mereka 77 peratus peratusan wanita yang mempunyai pendapat yang sama juga tinggi 62 peratus
8470507 anehnya lelaki 74 peratus lebih daripada wanita 47 peratus meletakkan kesalahan pada diri mereka sendiri apabila mereka lelaki gagal untuk mengekalkan atau mendapat ereksi
8470508 ini mungkin menjelaskan yang kegagalan untuk mendapatkan kepuasan seksual yang sepenuhnya mungkin lebih banyak dipengaruhi oleh faktor fizikal berbanding faktor psikologi
8470509 pada asasnya ereksi dibahagikan kepada empat tahap yang berlainan di mana gred empat adalah yang paling diidamkan
8470510 gred empat bermaksud ereksi yang tegar dan keras dan selalunya akan menandakan tahap kepuasan seksual yang lebih tinggi
8470511 gbss menunjukkan kepada kita bahawa kekerapan melakukan seks bukan tanda kepuasan walaupun majoriti lelaki dan wanita tidak berpuas hati dengannya kekerapan
8470512 bukan kuantiti yang penting di sini tetapi kualiti rahsia seks yang lebih baik adalah tidak lain dan tidak bukan ketegaran ereksi
8470513 lelaki dan wanita amat responsif terhadap memperbaiki kehidupan seksual mereka di mana 25 peratus responden lelaki dari seluruh dunia menyatakan keinginan untuk meningkatkan kehidupan seksual mereka termasuk lelaki dari malaysia 22 peratus

8470531 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8470532 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8470533 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

8470552 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

8470554 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8470555 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

8470614 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

8470637 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8470638 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8470639 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8470640 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8470641 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8470642 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8470643 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8470644 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8470645 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

8470649 os republicanos diziam que eu era muito jovem e inexperiente para ser o comandante em chefe da na o isso lhes soa familiar n o funcionou em 1992 e n o funcionar agora porque barack obama est no lado certo da hist ria

8470652 e o que mais importante barack obama sabe que os estados unidos n o podem ser fortes fora a menos que sejam fortes dentro o mundo deveria estar mais impressionado pelo poder de nosso exemplo do que pelo exemplo de nosso poder

8470654 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

8470697 probably fannie mae and freddie mac despite what u s treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
8470698 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could
8470699 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink

8470707 i wanted to express a variety of emotions to each of you regret empathy confidence and responsibility
8470708 i have a large heart that only wants help others not harm them
8470709 this incident has caused me to open my eyes and realize that i am the only person to blame i have to take full responsibility for my actions and live with the consequences determined by the administrative staff from conestoga valley high school and millersville university
8470710 encouraging students to visit ones website on which one is depicted as a person drinking while in a pirate costume is not equivalent to drinking with students while dressed as a pirate if the relationship between teacher and students is somehow damaged by the recognition that the teacher drinks on some occasions then i would say those students have been subjected to an unfortunately false concept of what it means to be an adult and are not aided by the perpetuation of such delusions
8470711 i believe snyders lawsuit will succeed because she was not given sufficient prior notice of the universitys actions or a chance to appeal it instead she says she learned of the change in her degree the day before she graduated

8470718 the aladdin board carefully considered vector capitals unsolicited proposals and unanimously determined that such proposals are not in the best interests of aladdins shareholders
8470719 we believe that these unsolicited proposals are opportunistic significantly undervalue aladdin and do not fully recognize the value of our company or its drm business
8470720 as part of our review the board and its advisors evaluated the vector capital proposals in the context of the companys recent financial performance our current business plan as well as additional alternatives available to the company which would enable it to enhance shareholder value
8470721 we are confident that through execution of its strategy aladdin will create substantially greater value for shareholders than either of vector capitals proposals vector capital fails to recognize the intrinsic value of the companys business and strategic initiatives

8470729 i can understand why they asked they wanted us to look at it because they think based on local politics that its a hot potato
8470730 they said that alves son and the former chiefs daughter were in the car and allegedly involved in the chicanery
8470731 we cant be in the business of handling local cities and towns political squabbles or wed spend all our time doing that

8470750 in the first half of 2008 the domestic petrochemical industry was faced with a serious situation where international oil prices soared to high levels repeatedly hitting record highs prices of production materials rose continuously refined oil products prices and crude oil prices were seriously inverted as a result of the government s stringent control over the prices of refined oil products and market competition was ever intensifying as a result all domestic oil refining businesses posted losses and the petrochemical industry witnessed an obvious decline in profitability in light of such grim situation the group fully implemented the overall cost leadership strategy as its main course of action the group further improved its production operation adjusted the assets and product mix enhanced internal management and strove for cost and expense reductions in the first half of the year the group maintained stable operations and production without encountering any major incidents in production safety or environmental protection the performance of major technical and economic indicators was satisfactory with total production output reaching 5 0687 million tons up 15 43 year on year whereas operating results posted a substantial decrease over the same period last year due to impact of changes in the external operating environment and policy related factors
8470751 in the second half of 2008 the average cost of crude oil may continue to climb since the significant loss in the company s oil refining operations arising from the inversion between refined oil product prices and crude oil prices in the country may not be reversed within a short period of time on one hand whether the state s financial subsidy policies to ensure the supply of refined oil products will change or continue remains to be seen on the other hand in line with the recent sharp drop in international oil prices prices of downstream petrochemicals witnessed a decline and the company has yet to process these already purchased expensive crude oil in transit and in stock the group cannot be optimistic about the extremely tough production and operation environment in light of the above unfavorable conditions the group will continue to strengthen management work to ensure smooth stable and optimized production operations further implement the overall cost leadership strategy amid the challenges posed by high oil prices dedicate efforts on corporate development tasks steadily pushing ahead reforms on the company s internal systems and mechanisms and strengthen team building among staff to further improve the company s operating efficiency

8470753 during the course of the wtc investigation i have had serious concerns about some of the findings and conclusions that nist has drawn
8470754 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
8470755 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view
8470756 i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
8470757 lets look at real alternatives that might have been the cause of the collapse of the world trade towers and how that relates to the official cause and whats the significance of one cause versus another
8470758 i hope to convince you to perhaps become conspiracy theorists but in a proper way
8470759 in every investigation ive taken part in the key has been to establish a timeline and the timeline is established by witness accounts by information from alarm systems by any video that you might have of the event and then by calculations and you try to put all of this together and if your calculations are consistent with some of these hard facts then perhaps you can have some comfort in the results of your calculations i have not seen a timeline placed in the nist report
8470760 its more important to take a look at that maybe there was damage by the debris falling down that played a significant role but other than that you had fires burning a long time without fire department intervention and firefighters were in that building i have yet to see any kind of story about what they saw what was burning were photographs taken nothing
8470761 the focus of the investigation was on the sequence of events from the instant of aircraft impact to the initiation of collapse for each tower for brevity in this report this sequence is referred to as the probably collapse sequence although it does not actually include the structural behavior of the tower after the conditions for collapse initiation were reached and collapse became inevitable
8470762 with the information and time available the sequence of events leading to the collapse each tower could not be definitively determined
8470763 none of the recovered steel samples showed evidence of exposure to temperatures above 600 degrees c for as long as 15 minutes
8470764 only three of the recovered samples of exterior panels reached temperatures in excess of 250 degrees c during the fires or after the collapse this was based on a method developed by nist to characterize maximum temperatures experienced by steel members through observations of paint cracking
8470765 all four test specimens sustained the maximum design load for approximately 2 hours without collapsing
8470766 the results established that this type of assembly was capable of sustaining a large gravity load without collapsing for a substantial period of time relative to the duration of the fires in any given location on september 11
8470767 the severe corrosion and subsequent erosion of samples 1 and 2 are a very unusual event no clear explanation for the source of the sulfur has been identified the rate of corrosion is also unknown it is possible that this is the result of long term heating in the ground following the collapse of the buildings it is also possible that the phenomenon started prior to collapse and accelerated the weakening of the steel structure a detailed study into the mechanisms of this phenomenon is needed to determine what risk if any is presented to existing steel structures exposed to severe and long burning fires
8470768 preliminary hypotheses we are studying the horizontal movement east to west internal to the structure on the fifth to seventh floors but truthfully i dont really know weve had trouble getting a handle on building no 7
8470769 if you go to world trade center one nine minutes before its collapse there was a line of smoke that puffed out
8470770 i suggest that theres an equally justifiable theory and thats the trusses fail as they are heated by the fire with the insulation intact these are two different conclusions and the accountability for each is dramatically different
8470771 gee gingerbaker try reading once in a while but no you wont acknowledge that people here are capable of having a liberal or anti bush view a fair number of us cheered when al gore got that nobel prize followed by a take that bush
8470772 then youll proceed to ignore all the science talk and change the subject to politics because it sets up convenient straw men you can take down on your favorite information controlling 9 11 twoofer site that bans skeptics upon or even before their first post
8470773 youll also ignore the vast tolerance of twoofer comments here in order to cover up the cognitive dissonance that comes from being everything you hate someone who spins everything politically without regard to science just like bush in regards to anything not right wing controls information with an iron fist whenever possible like on the typical twoofer forum and abhors openness
8470774 there isnt much separating bush from the twoofer crowd about the only thing that separates the two is that once in a while someone in the bush administration gets some science right

8470888 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university why is my wife glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because all our predecessors were thick
8470889 i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright
8470890 those people who could sing and play and recite and write poetry those people who could make wonderful beautiful things with their hands those people who could dream dreams see visions why didnt they get it was it because they were weak those people who could work eight hours underground and then come up and play football weak
8470891 those same people who read poetry and wrote poetry and taught me how to sing verse is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours
8470892 so what if i didnt attribute it to kinnock i cant quite understand this if i was making up who i was then thats one thing

8470912 our founding fathers did not pledge their support to im sorry mr
8470913 and when we lose our independence we lose our freedoms and we lose our sovereignty
8470914 the only difference between democrats and republicans is democrats want to tax and spend and republicans want to borrow and spend
8470915 that party has never shown up as more than an asterisk
8470916 theres a higher saturation of police and private security in this area than anywhere else in the city
8470917 we spend more time fighting perception than crime in this area
8470918 the administration of the asu downtown phoenix campus in conjunction with the city of phoenix is committed to creating and sustaining a community environment that is safe and productive for students faculty and all members of the community we believe that in order to provide a safe and productive learning environment we must partner with our students and provide them not only with a strong police and security presence on the asu downtown phoenix campus but also provide opportunities for them to actively engage in the promotion of personal and community safety
8470919 the crime rate in this area is very low because of the amount of patrol zones and officers in the area
8470920 in addition to our regular patrol officers we have bike foot and mounted patrols parking enforcement and liaison officers that are constantly looking for suspicious activity its one of the safest sections of the city
8470921 theres a balance between anxiety and complacency which is why we host a lot of educational programs and seminars throughout the year
8470922 crime happens in neighborhoods shopping malls and campuses we try to mitigate those crimes of opportunity through visibility and interaction with the community
8470923 i knew coming in that the area is safe to be around
8470924 with taylor place security the asu and phoenix police its easy for any student to see how safe dpc can be if students take their responsibilities seriously
8470925 for the past 50 years the memorial union has been central to our campus offering a gathering place for students faculty staff and visitors to engage
8470926 throughout the renovation every decision we made was based on meeting the needs of our students and the asu community the newly remodeled mu will be an area on campus that our students can enjoy and be proud of
8470927 many people consider the things which government does for them to be social progress but they consider the things government does for others as socialism
8470928 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8470929 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8470930 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8470931 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8470932 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8470933 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8470934 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8470935 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8470936 a number of police chiefs and sheriffs wanted guidelines and a clear set of rules
8470937 if the greens were fine we wouldnt be doing this work
8470938 but since were doing this work we think it will be a better course
8470939 even if they were to move the green back to exactly what it used to be we could do it
8470940 i think the usga just made a mistake in 98 putting the hole there if we meet somewhere in the middle on the slope we can have that green the same speed as the others
8470941 but two short par 3s just doesnt work in this day and age
8470942 were doing a lot of work for the 2010 open its not the longest course but its one you have to figure out how to get around use your mental ability
8470943 had i been more attentive to calls i received from recruiters my career opportunities would have expanded tremendously my mission now is to share my experiences and contacts with companies looking to grow and with talented executives and managers who are looking to advance their careers to best help their families
8470944 i made the mistake of looking only within my own company for career advancement i never anticipated the 3rd largest american life company would someday cease to exist
8470945 the life companies who have an active recruiting program and a focus on growth are the ones who will succeed in the years to come
8470946 we are excited to announce a magical slate of platinum titles for the first time on blu ray high definition this celebrated collection of animated features demonstrates disneys commitment to deliver great content
8470947 the landscape for the blu ray format is very healthy and we believe that the enhanced movie experiences that the format provides such as disneys bd live network offer consumers the chance to reinvent the experience of watching movies in their homes and the interactivity and connectivity that is being provided will truly make the family room relevant again
8470948 disneys bd live experience will enrich and deepen the overall consumer experience and we are delighted that snow white and the seven dwarfs will be the one that will launch disneys bd live network worldwide

8470951 he was like a prince in milan and at chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes
8470952 everybody needs to work like everybody else and everybody needs to prove he deserves to play
8470953 i think maybe he lost some self confidence step by step a player goes in the wrong direction
8470954 he was not my first option but the club gave him to me as a second option
8470955 i believe in the future he will again be a player of high quality the truth is i never had a single personal problem with him and i wish him well for the future
8470956 what does it mean in america today when dave mccune a steelworker that i met in canton ohio saw his job sent overseas and the equipment in his factory was literally unbolted crated up and shipped thousands of miles away along with that job
8470957 america can do better and tonight we say help is on the way
8470958 later when they announced the closure they still owed 1 75 million on that loan
8470959 nothing on the books at the time prevented them from not only selling the facility but gutting it even though they owed 1 75 million to the state of ohio
8470960 i never thought that a few weeks later id get a phone call from his staff which i thought was a joke and kind of blew off until his immediate assistant called me
8470961 they talk about andy warhols 15 minutes of fame i lived it it was unbelievable
8470962 massillon was in the process of losing about 2 200 manufacturing jobs
8470963 ansell perry had closed we had closed eatons had closed in a very short time massillon took a very very hard hit in its corporate tax base we lost a lot of good paying benefit providing jobs its why were in the shape we are today
8470964 i was born and raised in massillon this has always been a great hospital and it will continue to be great
8470965 im surprised at the big turnout they had especially on a rainy day
8470966 i think perhaps the people of massillon felt a little abandoned when a lot of the services moved to doctors
8470967 i think some of the facilities here at massillon are nicer
8470968 is that if we are not moving forward we are moving backward you have to always be looking to the future and looking at programs and strategies that work for all kids
8470969 if any student doesnt pass the test its not a good thing
8470970 our ultimate goal is that all of the students pass in all different areas
8470971 we try to have our kids be a part of our core curriculum as much as possible
8470972 our philosophy is if you dont expose the kids to the materials they wont have a chance to learn it its a matter of making sure they are exposed to as much information as possible
8470973 if a strategy isnt working you cant continue on and hope things change
8470974 you have to stop step back and make sure there isnt a strategy that would work better
8470975 the challenge is that you have kids at all levels and whole classroom instruction happens on rare occasions
8470976 we work more to individualize our instruction so that kids at the higher end arent bored and the students who dont understand right away arent confused
8470977 we need to challenge all of our kids to not only pass the test but to reach accelerated levels
8470978 the good part is we have parents who are very supportive if parents are involved with kids and our staff and administration is committed to the kids they will succeed
8470979 it is going to take every single one of us for our kids to do well

8470982 petraeus is careful not to credit all the progress to the surge of u s troops in 2007
8470983 v oters should try to determine the type of leader john mccain or barack obama would be in the worlds most powerful leadership position
8470984 how capable a leader would john mccain or barack obama be as president
8470985 mccains campaign has been anything but well organized his organization has experienced high turnover frequent resignations terminations and regular shifts in focus as a candidate mccain has often agreed on strategy and positions with his staff only to abandon them the next day
8470986 mccain has often left a trail of messes that need to be cleaned up after him projecting what mccain would be like in the white house one could probably expect lots of turnover and instability in his cabinet and white house staff
8470987 in contrast barack obama got his early training as a community organizer
8470988 as his candidacy has progressed he has expanded his central team and successfully married it to his field organization his organization resembles a growing corporate structure like google goog or intel intc a strong central core linked to a creative group of individuals
8470989 projecting this forward into the white house one would likely expect a disciplined staff around obama integrated with empowered people throughout the government carrying out multiple initiatives
8470990 how would each of these men respond to the pressure of surprise events like september 11 or hurricane katrina mccain would probably be impulsive in contrast obama would be likely to gather a group of experts around him listen carefully to their advice and make decisions
8470991 para nosotros es una clara se al de que la campa a de promoci n que estamos desplegando est dando buenos resultados
8470992 tambi n influye la campa a de concientizaci n que estamos realizando con brasil que en este caso se traduce en votos
8470993 downtown port orchard is a very small part of what is known as port orchard
8470994 thats just a fraction of the people whose mailing address is port orchard
8470995 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8470996 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8470997 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8470998 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8470999 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8471000 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8471001 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8471002 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8471003 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8471004 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8471005 creeping around back doors dropping hints and providing media speculation but not finding any evidence of wrongdoing or illegality
8471006 i am prepared to wait on the court steps for them and if they dont turn up they can go away for ever
8471007 what i am dealing with is the issue before us today conflicting evidence
8471008 amp financial services new zealand is being affected by an unprecedented wave of regulatory tax and saving changes as well as dynamic market and competitor activity
8471009 its certainly the worst case of over crowding we came across
8471010 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8471011 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8471012 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8471013 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8471014 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8471015 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8471016 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8471017 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8471018 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8471019 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8471020 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8471021 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8471022 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8471023 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

8471031 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8471032 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8471033 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8471034 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8471035 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8471036 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8471038 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8471039 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8471040 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

8471042 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8471043 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

8471095 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard

8471113 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8471114 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8471115 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8471116 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8471117 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8471118 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8471119 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8471122 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8471123 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8471124 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8471137 now hes a symbol of anti russia resistance in the post soviet space he defended the interests of his small country
8471138 eventually russia will be forced to leave and those states will be a part of sovereign georgia
8471139 once georgia is a part of europe that will happen

8471175 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8471176 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country

8471183 the time for change has come and barack obama is the change we need
8471184 for eight years john mccain has fallen in line with every one of george bushs national security decisions and now he offers up four more years of the same failed policies barack obama has proven that he has the judgment to deliver the change we need
8471185 make better health care and benefits for veterans a higher priority than tax cuts for exxon mobil and the wealthiest americans
8471186 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8471187 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose

8471190 barack obama will lead us away from division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope
8471191 if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope then join hillary chelsea and me in making sen barack obama the next president of the united states
8471192 i think we all had fun once we knew it was all safe
8471193 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8471194 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8471195 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8471196 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8471197 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8471198 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need

8471206 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8471207 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running

8471222 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8471223 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8471224 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8471225 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8471226 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8471227 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8471228 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8471229 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8471230 barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home
8471231 sounds familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8471243 i know you hear that phrase used all the time in politics but i mean it weve travelled the world together
8471244 but i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country

8471394 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8471395 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8471396 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8471397 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8471398 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8471399 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8471400 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run

8471419 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8471420 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8471421 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8471422 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8471423 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8471509 let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8471510 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job

8471521 if there was any deep division in the music scene in 1977 it wasnt people scratching their heads at less than stellar releases from kansas foreigner styx or steely dan and neil young it was the demise of live music as disco came to prominence i could make the argument that kansas nugent and other arena acts gained fans because people who hated disco really hated disco myself included
8471522 john jansens comments made me think of some of the bad things white people have done timothy mcveigh terry nichols the unabomber not to mention almost all the serial killers in the u s and all those arab terrorists theyre caucasian i just dont think we can afford to have white people running this country they are way too dangerous
8471523 i really used to be amazed how these individuals could be so blatant about who they really are and yet have their assemblies still pour money into their pockets so they can live like movie stars and then you have those who are of the new faith cashians and followers of santa christ
8471524 a lot of people are interested in the dog trials because its work you do at home with your dogs
8471525 people always say how good their dogs are but unless you take them in to the trials and have a go no one is really going to know about it
8471526 we put on a speed trial especially for them more for the work they do youve got to get around as fast as you can but also as neat as you can
8471527 it doesnt happen very often but you can still end up with 100 points but youve got to have a really good run

8471531 the gold medal winners were our dumpsie dearie jam this is a blend of pears apples and plums and is an old family recipe mint and rosemary jelly and figs in red wine
8471532 we have been fortunate enough to medal each year at these awards which in itself is quite a feat
8471533 these awards are a national competition and are for commercial people
8471534 i dont particularly like cooking but if you can win gold medals at the national fine food awards it is very pleasing
8471535 we know that josh with his heart and with his faith is in a better place
8471536 i added a few packs of polaroid to my stash
8471537 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8471538 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8471539 a man stopped me and said he saw people breaking into my car
8471540 for example whenever i take a cab i give the driver a large tip and say vote democratic
8471541 whenever i take a taxi i dont give the driver any tip at all
8471542 subsequent to that one of the credit cards in the wallet was used at least three different locations to make purchases
8471543 we need to know who they are so we can charge the one individual for stealing the wallet and find out which one of them actually used the credit cards at the gas station so we can charge them appropriately there as well
8471544 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8471545 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8471546 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8471547 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8471548 they were afraid the other children would fall off them so they didnt want to allow them in the bathroom
8471549 i would just like for her to be able to go to the bathroom like everybody else

8471554 hopefully well get close to that someday im still young this is my first olympic final
8471555 i thought i was feeling good and ready to roll
8471556 ive got to get stronger we know weve got the finish now we just need to figure out how to stay with them and stay relaxed back to the drawing board
8471557 i think there are societal advantages that african runners have
8471558 weve got kids staying inside playing video games and on the internet all the time theyre outside working theyve got jobs when theyre young theyve got to get to school on foot its all the stuff thats been publicized for years and years it hasnt changed and thats why theyre still where they are
8471559 its pretty pathetic that we cant get track and field in prime time
8471560 the sport isnt dying theres 91 000 people out here tonight there was a packed house at the olympic trials there are packed houses in europe maybe if we can get on tv people will start to see that its an entertaining sport
8471561 were still going to be working real hard were going to switch some things up in training this coming year and well see what kind of benefits that brings
8471562 ive always got it in the back of my mind that i can compete with these guys for me its going to be a certain day at a certain time and it will click tonight just wasnt the night
8471563 we built a giant wishlist of features we wanted to add based on the opinions of our team and original samba players
8471564 we then worked with sega to determine which features would be the best for the game and came up with a list that felt good
8471565 we had people constantly playing the game from the moment it was up and running on the wii
8471566 to gauge the opinions about the wii version we created playtesting sessions that included folks who had played the original games only a few times alongside hardcore samba fans that had mastered the original using the data from these different types of players we were able to make sure the game felt rock solid for the new player and hardcore samba fan alike
8471567 we should get up stand up and fight for your right
8471568 i congratulate south gloucestershire trading standards and local police for successfully shutting down gary boulters criminal operation elspa would like to thank the efforts of everyone concerned in their attempts to protect legitimate local traders and remove illegal products from the marketplace
8471569 mr boulter has been dealt with severely by the court and this should stand as a stern warning to others who are tempted to engage in this type of activity he has not only lost his liberty but now also has to pay significant sums of money in costs and under the confiscation order as well as having all of his discs and associated equipment forfeited he obviously had no regard for the local retailers whose businesses are badly affected by counterfeiting and he was supplying pornographic films which are age restricted and the content of which means they should only be sold by a licensed sex shop
8471570 where press freedom has deteriorated the most over the past five years
8471571 gamers have come to expect a certain level of realism in video games and by collaborating with key brands in the industry were able to deliver with guitar hero world tour
8471572 with the most advanced wireless instrument controllers the in game likeness of multiple multi platinum recording artists and authentic on stage gear the game offers the ultimate rock and roll experience
8471573 were here to nominate a candidate for could you imagine what would happen if something happened and the police werent here
8471574 one on hand its very reassuring in terms of knowing that when we need a police presence its there
8471575 so for example if there were to be riots in town or god forbid a terrorist attack or other things that are security related its kind of like our own version of
8471576 if theres anything on the negative side its kind of the sense of hummm we have all these bigwigs in town where were you when i needed you
8471577 is it supposed to make us feel safe but it doesnt
8471578 its a small price to pay for hosting a tremendously big important event that is the center of the worlds attention
8471579 going to conjure the image of the city being one step away from a fascist state
8471580 you have to prepare for the worst and breathe a sigh of relief if in fact in looks like you were overstaffed
8471581 an individual pays tax at a given bracket only for each dollar within that brackets range for example a single taxpayer who earned 10 000 in 2007 would be taxed 10 of each dollar earned from the 1st dollar to the 7 825th dollar 10 7 825 782 50 then 15 of each dollar earned from the 7 826th dollar to the 10 000th dollar 15 2 175 326 25 for a total of 1 108 75
8471582 what good is voting if all i can choose between is and a turd sandwich
8471583 no matter how much you try to link bush and mccain they are not the same
8471584 senator mccain has proposed substantial tax cuts offset only very partially by proposals to broaden the tax base
8471585 more government debt eventually translates into higher interest rates which discourage business investment and consumers demand for homes and such durable goods as automobiles or alternatively into increased debt owed to foreigners which mortgages the nations long term economic future
8471586 someone tell me based on this image alone why i shouldnt
8471587 my income dropped to below the standard deduction so now i pay no taxes thanks obama
8471588 within the top 5 only the top 1 will actually see tax increases and those tax increases will be minor
8471589 i want to pay more so my boss will be happy
8471590 your obama tax cut is you will probably not get an obama tax cut
8471591 im going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by 20
8471592 i only saved a dollar too its unfair that he got ten times more than i
8471593 why should he get 10 back when i got only two the wealthy get all the breaks
8471594 we didnt get anything at all the system exploits the poor
8471595 john mccain would tax you xxx xx more than barack obama
8471596 but if there were no wal mart where would you buy groceries you should just be thankful that they provide you with all the shopping lanes and food you will need
8471597 you tax us when were born you tax us when we die you tax us when we eat you tax us when we sleep get off our backs
8471598 my income dropped to below the standard deduction so now i pay no taxes thanks obama
8471599 pretty soon you may actually have a 50 hour minimum wage but a cup of joe will also cost you about 50
8471600 in about 6 weeks the minimum wage will go up to 50 per hour
8471601 so according to your interpretation of obama nomics we will all have to work for about an hour for a cup of joe pretty soon
8471602 happy with your obama tax cut consider donating to the obama campaign

8471605 cant you just believe man never mind the lack of graphics and the piss poor design this is like real ya know
8471606 delaware can get another senator but my boys cant get another father
8471607 my mothers creed is the american creed live our faith and treasure our families everyone can make it if they try hard enough
8471608 that american dream feels like its slipping away i have never seen a time where washington has seen so many people get knocked down and do nothing to help them get back up
8471609 thats what well get if geo i mean freudian slip freudian slip john mccain is elected
8471610 john mccain doesnt seem to get it barack obama gets it he chose to go to the southside of chicago he could have gone anywhere he made chicagoans lives his life
8471611 we dont need a good soldier we need a wise leader
8471612 were ready america is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8471613 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8471614 president clinton reminds us what its like when you put the american people first
8471615 sadly membership has now fallen to 10 with only one member under 40 and our most recent meeting had only five people in attendance
8471616 we realise many people work day to day and everyone seems to be so much busier than in days gone by but we also feel that we work for a most worthwhile cause
8471617 while we receive wonderful support for all our activities from the people of narromine and district we need the help of able bodied men and women to be able to continue
8471618 from all of the above you can see the problem facing us at the moment and perhaps there are some people who would like to help us remedy our situation
8471619 that has only delayed the inevitable without new members coming on board
8471620 were one of the last ones in this part of the state the focus during my year as president is to try and recruit new members
8471621 of those 10 there are probably six who will retire during the next five years
8471622 we are a struggling organisation although we are getting new members all the time nationally
8471623 we would really love to see a lot more members particularly younger ones
8471624 it is very hard to encourage people to do something unless they really want to with any organisation
8471625 what is it that theyre saying that i dont think is worth listening to
8471626 what is it im saying that i think is so important
8471627 what is it that theyre saying that i dont think is worth listening to
8471628 what is it im saying that i think is so important
8471629 a pol tica ling stica deste goberno foi continu sta se non de retroceso
8471630 your daughter ive brought her home she was taking shelter from the rain under the old tree on the road from town
8471631 pigeon we made had our initials and a carefully chosen name written under one wing
8471632 i am a hillary delegate and the people that voted for me expected me to vote for hillary we feel it is an obligation to vote for her
8471633 they started on us before we had time to grieve
8471634 as for other peoples money he seized it by stealth without the slightest hesitation yet when he had secured the money he was quite prepared to show contempt for it by reckless prodigality or to throw it to potential enemies without the slightest need in short he kept no money himself and allowed no one else in the world to keep any as if he were not overcome by avarice but held fast by envy of those who had acquired money thus he cheerfully banished wealth from roman soil and became the creator of nation wide poverty
8471635 as for other peoples money he seized it by stealth without the slightest hestitation
8471636 mira el video yo sali ahi lo acabo de ver y kyaaaa de ver sabido que lo subirian hubiera volteado a la camara aunque lo que estaba frente a mi era mejor

8471638 how to tell if your 17 yr old daughter is having sex
8471639 the lord hasnt finished with me and being bought back from the dead is for gods glory
8471640 no eye has seen no ear has heard no mind has conceived what god has prepared for those who love him
8471641 there may be a bit of argy bargy on the way through but i think its time to do this
8471642 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8471643 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8471644 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8471645 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8471646 the real challenge for mr rudd is will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply
8471647 mr rudd has the power now to withhold money from states that have not complied with this and the challenge for him is will he do so
8471648 since happiness and effectiveness depend upon the kinds of thoughts we think it is absolutely impossible to be happy if we think unhappy thoughts
8471649 if you put into your mind thoughts of fear you will get thoughts of fear
8471650 in my experience through many years in working with people i have discovered that the most vital creative and positive thoughts are those stated in the bible its words are alive they are capable of revolutionizing the entire personality
8471651 this means simply that if you fill your mind with spiritual words so that they sink from your conscious to your subconscious through spiritual osmosis you will condition your personality with spiritual power of sensitivity that gods will can operate in you
8471652 over the years i had noticed that certain passages from the scriptures had a particular potent effect on human beings
8471653 the process i have used both personally and in counseling is simply that of committing these great passages to memory
8471654 the best results are gained by utilizing spare minutes to say these scripture passages or thought conditioners over and over as you are riding on a bus or train or washing the dishes or waiting for an appointment utilize fractional moments to dwell and meditate upon the meaning of these texts as you do so there will flash out from them new insights new perceptions of truth gradually by a deep therapy they will drive into the mind until presently your life will become a living demonstration of gods power
8471655 i can understand why you would ask i mean its not like i ever talk about it
8471656 it says here that theres a scholarship for people who blog a ten thousand dollar scholarship
8471657 shrug i dont know i dont blog very often anymore reads over shoulder it says you have to write a three hundred page essay about an interesting blog youve read by another person and why it interests you
8471658 i guess ive got that covered ive been running my blog since the seventh grade thats about thinks holy crap about three or four years i have about seven hundred posts havent really posted anything lately though
8471659 dani do you have a blog you might want to try for this scholarship too
8471660 why not blogging is easy when youre bored you sit down and spill out your brain in text
8471661 val theres another one here for people who do copious amounts of community service
8471662 scoff and we all know thats never going to happen unless i committed a misdemeanor and i dont theyd count mandatory community service
8471663 well maybe we should involve you in more community activities
8471664 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8471665 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8471666 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8471667 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8471668 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8471669 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8471670 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8471671 that was as clear a message as you could get as to why barack obama should be president
8471672 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8471673 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8471674 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8471675 the idea of this little tour around the twin cities
8471676 is to play shows in celebration of and solidarity with our brothers and sisters who are engaged in speaking truth to power during the convention
8471677 i slam poetics with the dialectic of a heretic eclectic styles i inherited from the dociet files and walked the highways with james meredith evoke the souls of langston and james baldwin because theres a fire in my eyes when i too sing america but the schools aint preparin ya for the next era so we sit by in a state of gentle stasis waiting for the genocide my genealogy lies in the ocean waves created by africans who refused to be slaves so why we slavin for the status quo
8471678 if there was any deep division in the music scene in 1977 it wasnt people scratching their heads at less than stellar releases from kansas foreigner styx or steely dan and neil young it was the demise of live music as disco came to prominence i could make the argument that kansas nugent and other arena acts gained fans because people who hated disco really hated disco myself included
8471679 john jansens comments made me think of some of the bad things white people have done timothy mcveigh terry nichols the unabomber not to mention almost all the serial killers in the u s and all those arab terrorists theyre caucasian i just dont think we can afford to have white people running this country they are way too dangerous
8471680 i really used to be amazed how these individuals could be so blatant about who they really are and yet have their assemblies still pour money into their pockets so they can live like movie stars and then you have those who are of the new faith cashians and followers of santa christ

8471685 why are my it costs going up but im getting less and less functionality

8471691 rather the identity crisis stems from a perceived lack of measurable results the most successful cmos are aggressively instituting rigorous performance measurement and analytics in every aspect of their organizations and tying those metrics to revenue and profit growth

8471698 men are not abusive because they have a problem with anger they have chronic anger
8471699 the coalition will oppose the rudd labor governments punitive 30 per cent increase in the so called luxury car tax
8471700 it is the politics of envy which will increase inflation
8471701 the highest selling so called luxury car is the toyota landcruiser which retails for around 70 000 and are driven primarily by those in rural and regional australia and those with the need for a people mover
8471702 the opposition has decided to stand up for lower taxes on luxury cars rather than for lower interest rates for working families
8471703 its not a great result at home when you should have done better
8471704 we gave away the ball way too much in the second half
8471705 a bit of lack of concentration could have cost us the game but we won and if we play well defensively down there theres no reason we shouldnt win
8471706 i think we showed were the better team when we moved the ball around but it wasnt our best game
8471707 we had chances in the second half and didnt score
8471708 but we didnt show all we have i think well do better in the home leg
8471709 i saw lots of amateur situations from the men in white the impact red and white real esteli and yellow and black the officials
8471710 but a win is a win the 1 0 is better than it seems because it forces them to win a game and if we can score an away goal it could be a huge advantage for us

8471712 the labor members of a senate committee have decided to rush out a report which endorses labor policy
8471713 the reality is that fuelwatch will not only not put the price of petrol down it will actually increase it
8471714 fuelwatch is nothing more than foolwatch and those labor mps that have decided to endorse it are doing nothing more than following mr rudd
8471715 its a rather unusual step that a senate committee would put out an interim report the purpose of which is to do nothing more than to deceive the independent senators
8471716 fuelwatch is sham it has the potential to push up the price of fuel for motorists its nothing more than a quick fix for kevin rudd the committee has failed to justify its position
8471717 the analysis by the accc has been criticised the committee travelled the width and breadth of the country and struggled to find anyone who would support this hare brained scheme
8471718 certainly the accs work is certainly subject to some considerable question
8471719 fuelwatch is working against independent petrol retailers in western australia in fact many have closed down since the introduction
8471720 there were 200 independent petrol retailers before fuelwatch there are now 17

8471725 doctors dont usually make predictions but they are predicting that within three days they will be able to feed him solids and that should build up his strength
8471726 cancimini the crabby twins i dont mean to imply that these people are not well integrated but often we will see a cancimini listening carefully to themselves talking to their other worried self they usually have 2 phones and will call themselves and let it ring without answering they have diverse attachments and often collect lots of colorful little things but cannot remember where they are rules home parties gumball machines and plastic coffee stirring sticks
8471727 these are the people who gave us life they are the reason we are here today
8471728 if there was any deep division in the music scene in 1977 it wasnt people scratching their heads at less than stellar releases from kansas foreigner styx or steely dan and neil young it was the demise of live music as disco came to prominence i could make the argument that kansas nugent and other arena acts gained fans because people who hated disco really hated disco myself included

8471748 cycles in capital flows to emerging markets have now been with us for two hundred years
8471749 i was a high class muscleman for big business for wall street and for the bankers
8471750 in short i was a racketeer a gangster for capitalism
8471751 i helped make mexico especially tampico safe for american oil interests in 1914 i helped make haiti and cuba a decent place for the national city bank boys to collect revenues in i helped in the raping of half a dozen central american republics for the benefit of wall street the record of racketeering is long i helped purify nicaragua for the international banking house of brown brothers in 1909 1912 i brought light to the dominican republic for american sugar interests in 1916 in china i helped to see to it that standard oil went its way unmolested
8471752 i was contacted by a woman named claudine who became my trainer as an economic hit man
8471753 she said she was sent to help me and to train me
8471754 she is extremely beautiful sensual seductive intelligent her job was to convince me to become an economic hit man holding out these three drugs sex drugs and money and then she wanted to let me know that i was getting into a dirty business and i shouldnt go off on my first assignment which was going to be indonesia and start doing this unless i knew that i was going to continue doing it and once i was in i was in for life
8471755 the system is set up such that the countries are so deep in debt that they cant repay their debt
8471756 when the u s government wants favors from them like votes in the united nations or troops in iraq or in many many cases their resources their oil their canal in the case of panama we go to them and say look you cant pay off your debts therefore sell your oil at a very low price to our oil companies today tremendous pressure is being put on ecuador for example to sell off its amazonian rainforest very precious very fragile places inhabited by indigenous people whose cultures are being destroyed by the oil companies
8471757 at that first meeting the president of the company mentioned some of the books that i had written about indigenous people and said thats nice thats fine keep doing your non profit work
8471758 we approve of that but you certainly would never write about this industry would you and i assured him that i wouldnt
8471759 he brings a great approach from front to back he sees all 11 guys thats what i think as a defensive coordinator your responsibility is
8471760 mikes very no nonsense and theyve responded well to that
8471761 its a hard playing group its just that they havent been consistent
8471762 the real positive i found when i first got here is all these guys are good guys who want to win
8471763 marvin re enforced some things swarm to the ball pad level footwork
8471764 mike cut his teeth as a secondary coach so technically in the back end weve improved tremendously
8471765 we already had some talented guys now you see it happening on the practice field
8471766 were not were more in your face more man zone blitz
8471767 you just have confidence that theyre going to make people have to go 80 90 yards and not give up 60 yard chunks
8471768 when were healthy we have as much talent as anybody needs to get to the super bowl
8471769 nobody expects much out of us and thats a good thing its just the opposite of cleveland where everybody expects them to be good
8471770 for an athlete to be successful in the sport entertainment business we live in today they need to perform on and off the field of play and communicating effectively is a big part of that
8471771 we are a u s based tour and the majority of our pro am players our fans our sponsors speak english
8471772 but they were definitely frustrated when they didnt have a similar experience of a year before when they were with a player who spoke english
8471773 its unfortunate the lpga has to create a policy to force players to do something that they should want to do on their own
8471774 i would 100 support a program that helps foreign born players
8471775 but to threaten them with suspension i dont understand why they are going about it as a program of punishment rather than reward

8471778 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8471779 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8471780 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8471781 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8471782 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8471783 faraz was a year senior to me when i joined the islamia college peshawar in 1954 he was remarkably handsome full of life but very much into poetry he would gather students around him and read out his mostly romantic poems there was no open mixing of male and female students in those days but somehow his poems managed to reach girl students who felt greatly attracted to him he would receive dozens of hand written letters from them not only those at the university but from a womens college in the city as well the well to do ones would have their servants deliver their letters while others would drop them in front of faraz at bus stops at that time he loved to watch hockey and would lead slogans at the annual match between the two old rivals islamia college and edwards collge
8471784 i am against dictatorship and military rule the time has not yet arrived when i should escape from the country out of fear i will stay home and fight

8471786 despite computer projections of temperature rises there has been no net global warming since 1998 that the current temperature plateau follows a late 20th century period of warming is consistent with the continuation today of natural multi decadal or millennial climate cycling

8471791 truthfully i dont know a womens rights leader thats my age or later that wasnt involved in the civil rights movement
8471792 so for me its seeing something in my lifetime that i was hoping id see in fact its the fruit of all that labor for all of us who fought for civil rights and its another milestone that we should all take pride in and i think a lot of us do basically our two great movements the civil rights movement and the womens rights movement have been working together for years and in a way it was just unfortunate that it happened like this

8471877 helping the church regain credibility and encouraging our society to return to civility
8471878 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
8471879 this can be important as a model for a religious leader who is bipartisan in reaching out to find out about candidates
8471880 hes putting himself on center stage at a critical moment with a tremendous amount of responsibility riding on his shoulders
8471881 hes representative of evangelicals who now see that the gospel message is more than just about getting people into heaven its about how we use our spiritual resources to make this world a better place

8472110 much will be made as it should be that he is fulfilling martin luther kings dream but he is also fulfilling lyndon baines johnsons dream a dream of opportunity in a great society
8472111 he saw that it should be devoted to the peaceful purposes for all mankind
8472112 perhaps you should research mr franks record a little more
8472113 most importantly ms jessamy follows the law in these matters and we respond to requests for discovery or any information that is known to prosecutors is made known to the defense
8472114 hospitals have many vacant open funded positions but are just simply unable to recruit the qualified nurses to fill those positions
8472115 the objective is to double the number of nurses educated in maryland schools
8472116 they have an opportunity to get to know union memorial how we work we have an opportunity to really get to know them very well the hope then is that once they graduate from their program that theyll continue on with us
8472117 all i can do is be me whoever that is
8472118 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
8472119 all i can do is be me whoever that is
8472120 all summer long one of the things we emphasized is every team has to forge its own identity
8472121 you cant worry about whos not here anymore you have to make your own mark
8472122 in many regards weve got a on our backs with teams maybe thinking its payback time for all those years of success
8472123 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8472124 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8472125 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8472126 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8472127 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
8472128 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
8472129 the 4a board said we have these funds and this is what we want to do with this
8472130 this is a wonderful opportunity to get real world work experience especially for those who might not qualify for other internships
8472131 also because of the match the student is being paid a great wage this will allow them the opportunity to focus on school and the internship and not have to work a part time job in addition to the internship its a win win situation for both the small business and the student intern
8472132 we work with students who are either in their sophomore year or one semester from graduating they have to have the knowledge and skills weve been working with may and june grads right now for spring internships were scheduled to place 27 students in the fall and 27 in the spring of 09
8472133 i knew jordan was a good student but i just felt that his skills needed a little seasoning
8472134 he followed up and i couldnt get rid of him
8472135 what was really beneficial for us was that it allowed us to bring someone in and give him real practical experience
8472136 he had the skills i think he just needed to apply them in the real world
8472137 its so hard to find people who are motivated and skilled and be able to fill in the gaps the internship is an invaluable resource i recommend it to all my peers
8472138 a final decision will be left for next session not this session
8472139 it seems to me the legislature is usually a little hesitant to consent on issues like this unless there are some parameters on it
8472140 the only way i see this working is having some sort of consensus before the session i dont know how that happens
8472141 would buyers want some guarantee that there be no expansion of gambling casinos video lottery terminals
8472142 love n a temporary insanity curable by marriage or by removal of the patient from the influences under which he incurred the disorder this disease is prevalent only among civilized races living under artificial conditions barbarous nations breathing pure air and eating simple food enjoy immunity from its ravages it is sometimes fatal but more frequently to the physician than to the patient
8472143 i cant tell you what it is but i know it when i see it
8472144 my definition i care for you i want good things for you when you are happy its the best thing in the world to see i want you to be safe i want to be with you thats as simple as i can make it there is more though it is difficult to express
8472145 punk rock is exemplary manners towards your fellow human beings
8472146 usually i would pass even reading the music blogs that are all independent music but this one was actually good because it did not seem like you had to be a scenester knowing the secret handshake to be allowed to read it they have a good collection of artists from all over the map which is always what i like to see and they have this funny ad running on there site to bring 44 to singapore
8472147 remote exploitation of a security policy bypass in windows skype versions could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code
8472148 thats the america that george bush has left us and thats the amerca well get if george excuse if john mccain gets elected
8472149 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8472150 its a huge issue its at least as big an issue as the dns issue if not bigger
8472151 i went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago we described this to intelligence agencies and to the national security council in detail
8472152 theres no vulnerabilities no protocol errors there are no software problems the problem arises from the level of interconnectivity thats needed to maintain this mess to keep it all working
8472153 everyone has assumed until now that you have to break something for a hijack to be useful
8472154 but what we showed here is that you dont have to break anything and if nothing breaks who notices
8472155 the rate of bgp path updates goes up by a factor of 200 to 400
8472156 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8472157 that means that nobody could put themselves into the chain into the path unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding as router in the path
8472158 we havent seen the attacks and so a lot of times people dont start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked
8472159 but the youtube case is the perfect example of an attack where somebody could have done much worse than what they did
8472160 he demonstrated a similar bgp interception privately for the departments of defense and homeland security a few years ago
8472161 it is time now to take the energy this campaign has awakened and channel it into long term efforts to
8472162 from our magnificent tasting room and deck overlooking our vineyards hidden lake and the inspiring osage valley teeming with wildlife to our exquisite missouri and california vintages delicious food and enticing gifts chandler hill is an enchanting destination to visit time and time again
8472163 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8472164 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8472165 barack obama is the man for this job barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8472166 thats one of the things i admire about him hes a real spouse and he reacts the way a real spouse does
8472167 he didnt like when his wife was attacked and he responded accordingly and thats the way i hope my spouse would have reacted if i was attacked
8472168 mr clinton sought and often managed to convince americans that the global economy was an opportunity and not a threat
8472169 whatever his legacy from this campaign that legacy of his presidency should be built upon
8472170 hes sort of yesterdays man trying to be todays man and he seems angry about it
8472171 its not more of the same says principal patricia massa
8472172 this is because the word of mouth has spread that this is a really powerful new tool
8472173 foreign history and languages and sciences art and music drama things that make a child a whole person
8472174 first i was like wow im going to be there until 4
8472175 but when i got here i thought this isnt bad
8472176 mohamed you have to understand that women just dont want you touching them full stop
8472177 just shut up and dont say anything its the best way
8472178 that is why when i go you guys wont miss me
8472179 i wish they would tell us what is going on this week so we all know
8472180 you dont have to make noise in everything you do what were you doing having a poo
8472181 i respect you for it you and rex are the cleverest people in the house its not a bad thing
8472182 i still like you i dont think youre a bad person
8472183 twelve houses between them two rich guys its almost like shooting fish in a bucket
8472184 the victims that prosecutors are electing to proceed with at this time
8472185 jackson hattiesburg laurel and all areas along the coast its a little mexico
8472186 im not against people trying to make living i have compassion for those folks but at the same time the taxpayers of mississippi shouldnt be subsidizing a plant that wont even hire their own workers
8472187 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8472188 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken
8472189 i need a job and got kids i heard that they need some help now
8472190 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs
8472191 that doesnt justify but it certainly explains why they might be hiring individuals who show up and say ill work for you
8472192 i havent spoken to her but id make them count em
8472193 just to be extra safe we are keeping a law enforcement officer outside the locked door
8472194 supposedly theyre gonna fight at 147 pacquiao hasnt had trouble moving
8472195 fame was the last thing he wanted and he never understood it he never needed it because from the moment he was a child he was surrounded by people who adored him
8472196 he wasnt syd because syd was pink floyd he wasnt being clever by being reclusive he was just being himself
8472197 roger was never mentally ill he was assessed by quite a few psychiatrists over the years and they always said hes unusual but there is no illness there was no cure because there was no illness he never fitted into the norm but thats what made him so special
8472198 supposedly theyre gonna fight at 147 pacquiao hasnt had trouble moving
8472199 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8472200 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8472201 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8472202 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8472203 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8472204 the american people are dumb enough to give the republicans another shot
8472205 encourage users to analyze comment on and even challenge washingtonpost coms articles
8472206 everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler
8472207 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8472208 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8472209 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8472210 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8472211 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8472212 one of the goals of the plan was to disturb the smallest amount of lakefront possible and still try to do something that will be a draw for tourists will be an economic boon to the city and i think the plan being unveiled some great steps in that direction
8472213 one of the things that is proposed is a building which would house among other things an interpretive center and that would be a public building public access
8472214 that would be perhaps a way to bring the city of geneva to the waterfront and just further enhance the downtown activity
8472215 people spoke almost unanimously in opposition to having residential condos built on the lake and yet thats the foremost item i see in this plan
8472216 i think it totally separates the city from the lake and i have a hard time understanding why thats in the best interest of geneva
8472217 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
8472218 there was an error rendering the control object reference not set to an instance of an object
8472219 anwar whatever we think of him and many of us are deeply skeptical is looking more and more like our future prime minister
8472220 there is a mounting sense of inevitability to his impending succession
8472221 we cannot afford to have a weak leadership because it could lead to our downfall
8472222 essa n o a primeira vez que n s temos uma praga ou um v rus
8472223 n o uma ocorr ncia freq ente mas n o a primeira vez
8472224 dismissing his theft of kinnocks speech biden said at the time so what if i didnt attribute it to kinnock i cant quite understand this if i was making up who i was then thats one thing but biden was making up who he was and he was making up what kind of country this is
8472225 esto es frustrante queremos ganar la mayor cantidad posible de partidos
8472226 el partido se nos complic innecesariamente fue un rival que no lo dio por perdido y lo sigui luchando por ah pensamos que ten amos el partido terminado antes de tiempo y lo terminamos sufriendo
8472227 never has short term partisan politics so depleted the strength of americas bipartisan foreign policy
8472228 its swinging like somebody caught in a tree and thats when you can really see the cabling and its the exact shape of a body same size everything but its just covered in moss
8472229 its exactly what it looks like just somebody caught in a harness in a seat harness
8472230 it was quite high up about 12 to 15 metres
8472231 it was when hillary and bill came and it was like 90 to 100 degrees i just handed people water and stuff i was wearing a gore t shirt
8472232 is just helping people get set up in the morning
8472233 it was pretty cool seeing ted kennedy and michelle obama i just liked how many people had their signs up
8472234 he was put to work hed go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8472235 american people had their first date with michelle obama and it was matched in another way by another generation by ted kennedy
8472236 spanned the generations to the way people were inspired and motivated by john kennedy those of us who were their age at one time had a similar opportunity to be motivated by change
8472237 ted kennedy inspired us one more time and michelle obama is modeling that change it was an unusual historic event and ive never been prouder to be a democrat in my life
8472238 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8472239 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8472240 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8472241 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8472242 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8472243 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8472244 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8472245 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8472246 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8472247 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8472248 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8472249 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8472250 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8472251 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8472252 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8472253 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8472254 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8472255 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8472256 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8472257 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8472258 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8472259 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8472260 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8472261 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8472262 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8472263 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8472264 one that makes energy more efficient and renewable creating millions of high wage jobs one that allows families to spend more of their precious dollars raising children instead of boosting oil company profits
8472265 give the oil companies another four billion dollars in tax breaks right now the united states imports about 70 percent of its oil from overseas at the same time billions of dollars that we spend on all that foreign oil seems to end up in the bank accounts of those around the world who are openly hostile to american values and our way of life co2 emissions are increasing global temperatures sea levels are rising and storms are getting worse barack obama knows theres no single platform for energy independence its not a question of either wind or clean coal solar or hydrogen oil or geothermal we need them all to create a strong american energy system a system built on american innovation in montana were investing in wind farms and were drilling in the bakken formation one of the most promising oil fields in america were pursuing coal gasification with carbon sequestration and were promoting greater energy efficiency in homes and offices barack obama understands the most important barrel of oil is the one you dont use
8472266 for the last eight years the big oil companies and their washington lobbyists have literally written our national energy policies they have made billions while the rest of us are stuck paying the bill
8472267 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future mccain has voted against tax credits for renewable energy 11 times and his only idea to solve our energy crisis is to keep doing what were doing as we watch prices go up and up and up
8472268 up with creating millions of good paying jobs rebuilding our bridges ports and water systems up with creating millions of sustainable energy jobs to lower the cost of energy lower carbon emissions and protect the environment
8472269 the prime minister has lost the mandate of the country and the nation
8472270 i hope the member for permatang pauh will contribute to the proceedings of this house i am satisfied he has been unanimously appointed leader of the opposition
8472271 there is no threat from anwar he has won in a by election and he becomes just another mp
8472272 obama preps for first public appearance as a bona fide god
8472273 btw obama is now officially the democratic candidate for the presidency of the united
8472274 moderates are akin to a substance with a neutral ph
8472275 terkait dengan insiden itu sriwijaya air saat ini dalam penanganan kewenangan knkt
8472276 could regain hurricane strength within the next day or two
8472277 will likely produce life threatening flash floods and mud slides
8472278 we are continuing to monitor this storm as state government agencies including the state police and the louisiana national guard have been put on standby so we are ready to quickly respond if the storm heads our direction
8472279 full assessment of the character of mr broadus is required
8472280 he doesnt seem the sort of bloke we want in this country
8472281 where are my daughters i came through the hospital doors with them where are they
8472282 they are in a smaller waiting room and are very safe
8472283 why arent they here with me in this waiting room
8472284 this is your chance to breath you dont breath well on earth and you rush everywhere you go i gave you a night sky so you could sleep but you never sleep i gave you the sun at the beginning of each day so you will smile but you dont smile anymore this is your chance
8472285 what does that have to do with my children i want them with me
8472286 no one keeps them safe but you now its your turn to feel safe yourself and when this is all over you will be with your daughters again i promise you
8472287 they can see you from where they are and they are just fine
8472288 but i cant see them i cant see my daughters
8472289 is the room you put my daughters in as bright as this one
8472290 if so my youngest will demand sunglasses she will flash her big blue eyes and pout her lips until she gets her way you know
8472291 we should all have a longing for home if that does not exist then something is very very wrong
8472292 ey tomas im talking to you es rude to ignore someone like dat you know
8472293 jack move outta da way so i can pop dis little brat
8472294 remember son no man has the right to take another mans life no matter how vile or wrong one may seem it is up to god to decide who is punished and who is not it may only be arrogance or ignorance that drives a man to take the responsibility of god into his own hands there is more to existence than just this one life there are powers beyond our comprehension we must understand this to truely understand the principals of right and wrong they reach far beyond merely what you see or what you feel here in this moment
8472295 look at me boy remember this face know who did this to you im going to let you live youre no threat to me you had the chance to take your vengeance and you squandered it
8472296 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8472297 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8472298 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8472299 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
8472300 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8472301 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8472302 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8472303 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8472304 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8472305 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8472306 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8472307 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8472308 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8472309 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8472310 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8472311 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8472312 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8472313 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8472314 it has been a very significant toll on myself and my family
8472315 it has been an unbelievable personal cost and pyschological cost
8472316 the only certainty is that the vehicle was light coloured and the make and model cant be confirmed from witness accounts
8472317 there are other possible sightings of ciara further along stirling highway so it cant be confirmed if she did or did not get into this vehicle
8472318 they were incredibly close their two characters just got married
8472319 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight
8472320 he was a talented and spirited student who continued to follow his passion for drama after leaving the college
8472321 we are excited to be working with rec solar in providing clean energy during the convention
8472322 rec solars vision is to make solar electricity part of the mainstream energy supply to make that shift in paradigm a reality we recognize that we must reach out to the next generation of energy consumers in their preferred online medium
8472323 with the assistance of myspace the solar recharging stations are designed to not only raise awareness of alternative energy sources that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels but also to encourage a sense of community both online and offline
8472324 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
8472325 hey where you booger eating morons going we can hit this guy
8472326 what will be the affect that globalisation might have on the overall garment industry in sri lanka particularly shes
8472327 the world is inexorably becoming a single global market place with or without regionalism
8472328 how supply chain works for competitive improvement of an apparel cluster
8472329 buyer driven networks and the lack of opportunity this gives to the suppliers to leverage for profit
8472330 the primary economic rents in the chain of production are increasingly to be found in areas outside production
8472331 the effect that the working environment working methods and worker motivation has on the apparel industries competitiveness
8472332 what varies is the nationality of the work force not who controls them
8472333 we prefer to hire women workers indian women will never travel without their whole family sri lankan women are more willing to go alone
8472334 the government has stopped allowing workers to be brought in from third countries
8472335 the part of retail and consumer pressure to provide acceptable work spaces and equipment and non forced labour
8472336 i saw your curious look and figured id just give you the answers to the questions everyone always asks me im 7 feet tall i weigh 350 pounds i have a 20 inch private my left testicle weighs 3 pounds my right testicle weighs 3 pounds and my name is turner brown

8472339 didnt you tell me it was on sale for 20 00 how did you get 34 50
8472340 i am not afraid of anything in this world there is nothing you can throw at me that i havent already heard im just trying to find a decent melody a song that i can sing in my own company
8472341 poor boy never say die things will be alright by and by
8472342 i wont lose a friend by heeding gods call for what is a friend whod want you to fall
8472343 well ive been faithful and ive been so good except for drinking but he knew that i would
8472344 im gonna leave this place better than the way i found it was
8472345 mmm god luv i love the way you do that
8472346 oooooh draco mmm i love the way our bodies fit
8472347 no were not too proud to lure you with food
8472348 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8472349 first of all its cibcs first profit in three quarters
8472350 its a lot of relief on the fact that it looks like they have written down almost everything they had to write down you can assume maybe i hope that the worst is perhaps behind cibc now and they can move on and get into a profitable business
8472351 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8472352 not ready 08 presser in denver colorado counterprogramming the democrats
8472353 the witch will continue to live as a symbolic figure attracting attention for her injustice
8472354 does anyone else have these annoying feelings of insecurity that they battle with
8472355 not ready 08 presser in denver colorado counterprogramming the democrats
8472356 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8472357 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8472358 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8472359 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8472360 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8472361 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8472362 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8472363 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8472364 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8472365 the journey will be difficult the road will be long
8472366 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8472367 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8472368 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8472369 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8472370 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8472371 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8472372 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8472373 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8472374 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8472375 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8472376 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8472377 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8472378 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8472379 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government

8472385 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8472386 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8472387 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8472388 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8472389 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8472390 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8472391 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8472392 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8472393 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8472394 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8472395 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8472396 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8472397 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8472398 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8472399 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8472400 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8472401 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8472402 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8472403 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8472404 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8472405 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8472406 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8472407 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8472408 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8472409 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8472410 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8472411 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8472412 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8472413 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8472414 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8472415 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8472416 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8472417 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8472418 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8472419 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8472420 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8472421 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems

8472432 this is no ordinary time this is no ordinary election
8472433 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8472434 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8472435 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8472436 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8472437 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8472446 you play this game long enough and you know teams are going to hit skids like this its just part of the game but its still frustrating to go through it
8472447 we have to worry about whats going on here if we take care of our business the standings will come out if we keep winning were not worried about the diamondbacks just like theyre probably not worried about us

8472483 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8472484 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8472485 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8472486 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8472487 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8472488 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8472489 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8472490 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8472491 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment

8472493 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8472494 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8472495 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8472496 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8472497 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8472498 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8472499 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8472500 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8472501 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8472502 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8472503 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8472504 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8472505 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8472506 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8472507 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8472508 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8472509 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8472510 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8472511 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8472512 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8472513 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8472514 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8472515 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8472516 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
8472517 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8472518 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8472519 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8472520 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8472521 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8472522 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8472523 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8472524 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8472525 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8472526 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8472527 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8472528 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side

8472546 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8472547 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8472548 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8472549 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8472550 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8472551 that was as clear a message as you could get as to why barack obama should be president
8472552 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8472553 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run

8472632 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8472633 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908

8472642 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8472643 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8472644 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8472645 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare

8472652 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
8472653 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator

8472705 the idea that kids need a cell phone is debatable to say the least the idea that kids need an iphone is pretty ridiculous
8472706 they apple chose not to distribute thats not censorship thats a business decision censorship occurs when the government tells someone they cannot say or write something

8472769 in 1992 the republicans called clinton too inexperienced and thats what theyre trying to say now about barack obama
8472770 clinton proved to be one of the best presidents of the 20th century
8472771 with clinton we were on the right track to do all the things we have talked about doing but now after bush were back to square one in borrowing tons of money and not pursuing alternative fuels
8472772 i also think president clinton successfully brought together the middle of the political spectrum he was able to reach out across traditional barriers
8472773 i used to watch gi joe on this tv and by golly i liked it
8472774 in 1994 my partner tiffany right started happy house when she was 26 she designed some hand printed cards and sold them in adelaide when they sold well we sold some property and spent 18 000 establishing the business and working from the second bedroom
8472775 i was working in business banking in commercial finance and joined full time in march 1996 it was liberating leaving the anz after 12 years
8472776 we built happy house by going to trade fairs expanding into gift tags and wrapping paper
8472777 the business took off but manufacturing was an enormous learning curve by 1998 we were exporting to 10 countries but manufacturing a diverse range of products running wholesaling marketing and sales teams got too hard
8472778 it was so demanding on cash flow whereas the capital demands for licensing are minuscule licensing also allowed us to diversity into all sorts of different areas such as designing mobile phone content and chocolates
8472779 we moved production offshore and we started to award manufacturing licences so we could just concentrate on the design of very innovative products
8472780 by 2002 we were exporting to 20 countries through three main licence agreements
8472781 we have retail sales globally of us45 million a year about 7 12 of what they sell comes to us
8472782 we have had a good distributor in dubai for four years we are also about to expand in the us we have been going to the new york trade fair for three years and we appointed an agent over there and have three deals and got four about to happen
8472783 asia is a huge focus for us now it represents the majority of revenue
8472784 we have a massive copyright issue particularly in asia but what can we do
8472785 even when i fail how do i do that because i have what it takes
8472786 seeing as youre the new sheriff in town might as well make it official

8472829 they were incredibly close their two characters just got married
8472830 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight
8472831 no one loved her doing it more than mark he was thrilled
8472832 they were devastated so we closed the set immediately as people were trying to come to terms with the tragedy
8472833 his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him
8472834 his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile
8472835 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8472836 tv viewers and their families shared fun and excitement so that their home atmosphere became better and they temporarily forgot about worries in their work
8472837 when the olympics ended on sunday they had to return to normal life and face the worries in their work but often they were unable to adjust their mood so quickly
8472838 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories
8472839 of the 2 519 batsmen who have taken the crease in 131 years of test cricket bradman stands alone and untouched
8472840 i am no aware of any other sport which has one competitor so far above any other performer
8472841 no one has even come close to this i suspect no one else ever will
8472842 he soon became not just donald bradman but the don
8472843 in the tough years of the depression he was a hero at home and a great source of national pride in difficult times
8472844 he is our clark kent the mild mannered ordinary man who contains and conceals immeasurable powers is always there when needed and always delivers the goods but with nobility of purpose
8472845 something to watch not only a great batsman but a marvellous fieldsman too
8472846 you have to play relaxed you have to go out there and know the game plan and play within yourself thats what coach always says play within yourself if you go out there and try to do a million things bad things can happen
8472847 you have to figure which guys are going to make it does someone else come in from the outside to make it and then also which guys will be on the practice squad so those guys will get a lot of opportunities in this game
8472848 its a great opportunity to get the get the feel of the game
8472849 in college was the last time i really got to play the whole game ill be in there most of the time you can get in the zone and the flow of things its totally different than going in for the third or fourth quarter
8472850 ive been thinking to myself its not over ive had a good camp yeah but its not over i need to go out there and practice hard this week to get myself ready for this game mentally and physically
8472851 i feel comfortable because while i was out our coach put a big emphasis on getting mental reps
8472852 i made sure i was there mentally and i tried to run the plays through in my mind so i felt fine
8472853 we ended up with 1800 so our hair is being shaved off
8472854 it was horrible it was his first day with his motorbike and he was so excited
8472855 and now he cant speak i cant even begin to understand what his parents are going through
8472856 its terrible how a split second decision can change everything
8472857 when we got that call we were all in shock seeing someone that was so full of life just laying there
8472858 he can certainly let us know when hes angry with us especially when we cut his hair
8472859 any small thing we can do to help goes a long way
8472860 its very hard for them and it can be very mentally draining trying to keep up with every day things and give matthew the attention he needs
8472861 es el sue o de todo jugador entrar jugar y anotar tus goles y qu bueno porque fue por el triunfo yo siempre he estado buscando la oportunidad y la que me den siempre tratar de aprovecharla desde fuerzas b sicas estoy trabajando muy bien y vamos empujando fuerte
8472862 claro es muy complicado porque somos buenos jugadores son buenos en lo que hacen pero uno tambien trabaja para ser mejor por eso uno es profesional y estamos trabajando dia con dia para ser mejores

8472867 dynamic and erratic spontaneous and radical audacious and immature committed if not altogether coherent ecumenically open and often experimental visible here and there now and then but unsettled institutionally almost monastic in nature but most of all enacting a fearful hope for society
8472868 there was a little bird with its wings up on the cars engine
8472869 one time we even got together and rode from perth to rockingham what were we thinking
8472870 during the war fathers brothers cousins and friends were away so we spent a lot of our time together
8472871 when the men came back from the war and women were married you had to leave the bank so there were employment opportunities for men
8472872 we are currently undertaking a major three year research project in the peel harvey to assess both the blue swimmer numbers and their recruitment patterns
8472873 until we have a better understanding of what is happening the two month closure to the crab fishery from monday september 1 will provide additional protection
8472874 by the end of the research program we hope to have enough data on mandurahs blue swimmer crab stocks to draw some solid scientific conclusions which can be used to inform the community and help the department of fisheries evaluate the most suitable management arrangements to keep this iconic crab fishery sustainable
8472875 to make sure people are not breaching the closure there will be patrols by fisheries and marine officers and anyone who does the wrong thing could face a fine of up to 3000 plus court costs and an additional mandatory penalty of 20 for every crab in their possession

8472879 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8472880 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8472881 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8472882 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8472883 that was as clear a message as you could get as to why barack obama should be president
8472884 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8472885 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8472886 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win

8472904 it the performance was all pre recorded and the mso did record a minority of the music that was performed
8472905 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording
8472906 its nothing to do with priorities or which orchestra is better it was decided to split the work between the two orchestras
8472907 its quite a normal practice and if the olympics had been in melbourne the sydney symphony would have been involved im sure of that
8472908 we should really be celebrating the fact that a country the size of australia has six international orchestras
8472909 there are millions of people watching and if something goes wrong youd be snookered
8472910 the nature of liturgical celebrations does not permit pre records it is an authentic expression of the prayer and song of those people at the time in that place
8472911 its been pretty rough at times with gas and food with everything going up the cost of living is going up so with added utility expense you have to do a little bit better budgeting

8472961 if there was any deep division in the music scene in 1977 it wasnt people scratching their heads at less than stellar releases from kansas foreigner styx or steely dan and neil young it was the demise of live music as disco came to prominence i could make the argument that kansas nugent and other arena acts gained fans because people who hated disco really hated disco myself included
8472962 john jansens comments made me think of some of the bad things white people have done timothy mcveigh terry nichols the unabomber not to mention almost all the serial killers in the u s and all those arab terrorists theyre caucasian i just dont think we can afford to have white people running this country they are way too dangerous
8472963 i really used to be amazed how these individuals could be so blatant about who they really are and yet have their assemblies still pour money into their pockets so they can live like movie stars and then you have those who are of the new faith cashians and followers of santa christ

8473174 i dont like to see it but i love the intensity i just think youve got to have enough poise where you dont hurt your own team theres that line where as soon as it becomes a personal vendetta then all of a sudden it impacts your squad
8473175 declaremos juntos en una sola voz aqu mismo ahora que barack obama ser nuestro presidente
8473176 es con gran orgullo que anuncio que barack obama es el candidato dem crata para presidente de eeuu por aclamaci n

8473178 the prime minister has lost the mandate of the country and the nation
8473179 i hope the member for permatang pauh will contribute to the proceedings of this house i am satisfied he has been unanimously appointed leader of the opposition
8473180 i would like to welcome the member for permatang pauh who is back in the house after a second political tsunami the government is like the titanic which is going to sink
8473181 there is no threat from anwar he has won in a by election and he becomes just another mp
8473182 since the march 8 elections till now we have done nothing but politicking but the defections havent happened they are waiting for it to happen but it hasnt happened good luck to them
8473183 if ever youre going to get recognized and adulation its going to be at the democratic national convention
8473184 some people have called the violence hindu christian clashes but this is not accurate innocent christians mostly of dalit origin continue to be attacked by communal organizations which are mocking the rule of law governance in orissa state appears to have disintegrated
8473185 we call for all church and christian educational institutions of catholic protestant independent and unaffiliated christian denominations in the service of society to close for one day
8473186 communal organizations have taken the law into their hands in 12 districts of orissa and are going about targeting not only institutions but also persons what is at stake is not only the freedom of conscience of a minority community but indias secular democracy its commitment to human rights and constitutional guarantees the destructive and divisive communal forces have to be stopped we want this message to go across to our fellow countrymen and that is why we are closing our educational institutions on friday 29th august 2008 in deep sorrow and anguish we hope parents become aware of the implications of the incidents in orissa we also request all our people to pray for the victims of violence in orissa and other places and their near and dear ones we also pray for the misguided perpetrators of violence that they may mend their ways and become responsible citizens
8473187 economists expect 2008s second half to be worse than first
8473188 the next 20 years are going to see the most powerful wave of technologically driven growth the world has ever seen
8473189 we will simply be throwing more people at an ever wider array of problems and they will be able to share their discoveries at the speed of light
8473190 patterns in long term trends over the last 200 years point specifically toward the human colonization of space in the next 20
8473191 all i can say at this point is there was a miscommunication as to whether or not the boom was supposed to be over the track when the train hit it
8473192 i heard the smash and everybody was laying on the ground i went overtop of everybody towards the front cabin to take the driver out of there
8473193 the driver honked the horn slammed on the brakes and the train goes squish
8473194 considering the train did derail and depending on the volume of passengers that could have been on the train and if it were a different time of day things could have been substantially worse
8473195 you never know which part of the internet youll need do you need sun cream part whats the quickest way to the airport part what about an ocean view room part or can you really afford this part which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8473196 it should be noted that this is a four night infomercial
8473197 i think keith has gone too far i think chris has gone too far
8473198 arent we on the right path and they pagans in the wrong wont our killed persons go to paradise and theirs in the fire
8473199 then why should we let our religion be degraded and return before allah has settled the matter between us
8473200 after his return from hudaybiyah allahs messenger marched against khaybar he halted with his army in a valley between the people of khaybar and the ghatafan tribe to prevent the latter from assisting the jews
8473201 when the apostle looked down on khaybar he told his companions o allah lord of the heavens and what they overshadow and lord of the devils and what into error they throw and lord of the winds and what they winnow we ask thee for the booty of this town and its people we take refuge in thee from its evil and the evil of its people forward in the name of allah he used to say this of every town he raided
8473202 when the apostle raided a people he waited until morning and then he attacked we came to khaybar by night when morning came and he did not hear the call to prayer he rode and we rode with him we met the workers of khaybar coming out in the morning with their spades and baskets when they saw the prophet and our army they cried muhammad with his force they turned tail and fled the apostle yelled allahu akbar khaybar is destroyed when we arrive at a peoples square it is a bad morning for them
8473203 allahs apostle reached khaybar at night it was his habit that whenever he reached an enemy at night
8473204 the prophet offered the fajr prayer the prayer of fear near khaybar when it was still dark he said allahu akbar allah is greatest khaybar is destroyed for whenever we approach a hostile nation to fight then evil will be the morning for those who have been warned then the inhabitants of khaybar came out running on their roads the prophet had their men killed their children and woman were taken as captives
8473205 when allahs apostle fought the battle of khaybar or when he raided any other people we raised their voices crying allahu akbar allahu akbar none has the right to be worshipped except allah
8473206 so muhammad began seizing their herds and their property bit by bit he conquered khaybar home by home the first stronghold defeated was naim next was qamus the community of abi huqayq the messenger took some of its people captive including safiyah bt huyayy the wife of kinanah and her two cousins the prophet chose safiyah for himself
8473207 dihyah had asked the messenger for safiyah when the prophet chose her for himself
8473208 when dihyah protested wanting to keep safiyah for himself the apostle traded for safiyah by giving dihyah her two cousins the women of khaybar were distributed among the muslims
8473209 the apostle prohibited four things the morning of the khaybar raid carnal intercourse with pregnant women who were captured mingling his seed with another mans en dus mochten de moslims wel een kleinen orgie houden met niet zwangere vrouwen nor it is lawful for him to take her until she is in a state of cleanness met andere woorden wanneer ze niet menstrueerden voor de rest mocht het wel nor can a muslim eat the flesh of donkeys nor eat any carnivorous animal nor sell any booty before it has been duly allotted
8473210 ali struck the jew with a swift blow that split his helmet neck protector and head landing in his rear teeth and the muslims entered the city muhammad conquered qamus the neighborhood of abi huqayq safiyah bt huyayy was brought to him and another woman with her
8473211 abi huqayq safiyahs father held the treasure of the nadir he was brought to allahs messenger and he questioned him but huqayq denied knowing where it was so the prophet questioned other jews one said i have seen kinanah safiyahs husband walk around a ruin muhammad had kinanah brought to him and said do you know that if we find it i shall kill you yes kinanah answered
8473212 the prophet commanded that the ruin should be dug up some treasure was extracted from it then muhammad asked kinanah for the rest he refused to surrender it so allahs messenger gave orders concerning him to zubayr saying torture him until you root out and extract what he has so zubayr kindled a fire on kinanahs chest twirling it with his firestick until kinanah was near death then the messenger gave him to maslamah who beheaded him
8473213 when we reached khaybar muhammad said that allah had enabled him to conquer them it was then that the beauty of safiyah was described to him her husband had been killed so allahs apostle selected her for himself
8473214 the muslims said among themselves will safiyah be one of the prophets wives or just a lady captive and one of his possessions
8473215 when the apostle married safiyah on his way out of town she was beautified and combed putting her in a fitting state for the messenger the apostle passed the night with her in his tent abu ayyub girt with his sword guarded the apostle going round the tent until he saw him emerge in the morning abu said i was afraid for you with this woman for you have killed her father her husband and her people
8473216 la intransigencia de los gremios hace que los caminos empiecen a cerrarse
8473217 masivo no hay un solo docente trabajando es una expresi n de protesta del conjunto de los docentes bonaerenses y una fuerte exhortaci n al gobierno provincial para que convoque y mejore su propuesta porque estamos convencidos de que puede hacer un esfuerzo mayor
8473218 la responsabilidad es del gobierno los gremios que integran el frente tenemos mandato para darle continuidad a las medidas de fuerza en caso de que no haya una oferta superadora
8473219 propusimos mejorar la oferta salarial y del lado gremial hay una postura tan dura e intransigente que los caminos empiezan a cerrarse
8473220 on a different note now that harus letters have reached akiyuki it finally occurred to me that the girl at the beginning of the op is her since shes throwing a letter that akiyuki catches at the end unfortunately that also means shell remain separated from akiyuki and that shell probably cut her hair at some point
8473221 i have to go to the bathroom will you pause it
8473222 get ready because you are about to fall in love
8473223 archivo de v deo mpeg 4 es compatible con el ipod
8473224 i hope this guy is going to talk for more than ten minutes
8473225 any time youre pitching from behind that means it takes any doubt out of a batters mind what youre going to throw next pitch if that happens major league hitters are going to hit you hard
8473226 he threw strikes thats why he had the results he had
8473227 its a shame we couldnt score a couple of runs for him
8473228 just strike one strike two dont get in hitters counts thats what theyve always told me and you can see it works
8473229 we just got my arm slot up just a little bit more
8473230 we kind of went back over some film and saw my arm slot was dropping down a little bit and i was slinging the ball
8473231 hopefully hes going to get better with his control because i think hes one of the parts thats missing in this team
8473232 its clear that the worldwide economic issues affecting businesses are having an impact on where and how advertisers spend their money it is also significant that the us and the uk as the highest spenders on advertising in their regions are showing reductions in our forecasts but overall the picture is still one of growth
8473233 besides the no holds barred interviews that offer a look at what its like to be a ppm panelist we will also reveal new insights between perceived and metered listening including how large this gap is and when and why it exists
8473234 these insights will help stations program smarter as we will share concrete ideas on what you can and cannot control in a ppm world
8473235 the coleman insights ppm series mapping the dna of ppm
8473236 the coalition will oppose the rudd labor governments punitive 30 per cent increase in the so called luxury car tax
8473237 it is the politics of envy which will increase inflation
8473238 the highest selling so called luxury car is the toyota landcruiser which retails for around 70 000 and are driven primarily by those in rural and regional australia and those with the need for a people mover
8473239 the opposition has decided to stand up for lower taxes on luxury cars rather than for lower interest rates for working families
8473240 the labor members of a senate committee have decided to rush out a report which endorses labor policy
8473241 the reality is that fuelwatch will not only not put the price of petrol down it will actually increase it
8473242 fuelwatch is nothing more than foolwatch and those labor mps that have decided to endorse it are doing nothing more than following mr rudd
8473243 its a rather unusual step that a senate committee would put out an interim report the purpose of which is to do nothing more than to deceive the independent senators
8473244 fuelwatch is sham it has the potential to push up the price of fuel for motorists its nothing more than a quick fix for kevin rudd the committee has failed to justify its position
8473245 the analysis by the accc has been criticised the committee travelled the width and breadth of the country and struggled to find anyone who would support this hare brained scheme
8473246 certainly the accs work is certainly subject to some considerable question
8473247 fuelwatch is working against independent petrol retailers in western australia in fact many have closed down since the introduction
8473248 there were 200 independent petrol retailers before fuelwatch there are now 17
8473249 in light of the fact that the public has been deluged with pro obama pabulum over the course of the last 10 months we felt it was crucial to make sure voters get the whole story and there is no better way to tell a story than to illustrate it with the company you keep
8473250 the fact remains barack obama launched his political career in the house of known terrorists and was helped with the purchase of a home by a now convicted felon this speaks volumes about his lack of judgment vision and experience
8473251 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could
8473252 when it was shown to him he was very very pleased indeed
8473253 he could only widen his eyes or something like that but it was explained to him and he was thrilled
8473254 it probably did as much as the injections they were giving him
8473255 doctors dont usually make predictions but they are predicting that within three days they will be able to feed him solids and that should build up his strength
8473256 even with the michael jackson task whenever hed do something you guys would go thats amazing
8473257 thats not helping dude people with disabilities they wanna be able to do it to the best of their ability they dont wanna be told that things are amazing were all on tv and we dont wanna look like s
8473258 just shut up and dont say anything its the best way
8473259 but then its like hes always saying oh its on camera its on camera yeah exactly its on camera what nice people we are nice caring people there should be more like that in the world might be a better place
8473260 a weekly podcast by a nice jewish couple and their baby girl living in the buckle of the bible belt
8473261 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama
8473262 i am proud that she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wanted for our chidlren
8473263 i am not so grateful for the chance to speak in the wake of hillarys magnificent speech last night but i ll do the best i can
8473264 like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8473265 the american dream is under siege at home and american leadership in the world has been weakened
8473266 he has shown a clear grasp of foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to rebuild our badly strained military
8473267 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding instincts and insight america will have the national security leadership we will need
8473268 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8473269 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him obama and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8473270 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8473271 han sido prepotentes entonces tenemos que tomar todas las empresas que ellos tienen aqu y que se vayan nosotros no podemos aceptar eso el tiempo previsto para un acuerdo se acab as que procedamos y pagaremos lo que cuesta eso realmente
8473272 son mentiras eso del hiperpresidencialismo de la concentraci n de poder y eso s molesta porque es jugar con la buena fe de los ecuatorianos
8473273 obviously we wont buy for the sake of it we do need good players but with amrabat pieters from fc utrecht and now nijland we signed potentially great players but also affordable players its harder for us to sign former ajax or az talents they are much more expensive and we do regret that aissati left us
8473274 we have a complete assessment of all dutch talents in pro football stef nijland for instance was assessed more than 20 times on various aspects of the game
8473275 we have several lists a scouting list for players who could play for psv 1 immediately and a list of future players like nijland who we signed for the future now stef can get used to the level we aspire to in eindhoven and we can prepare him for the big games
8473276 again its not that we want to be az or something but due to the fact that we qualify for the cl for years already we can afford to strengthen our group
8473277 its not that we wont scout in south america anymore but i just want to see more dutch lads in our team players we can identify with players who dont need to assimilate
8473278 you need that mix you need players who can perform on a weekly basis to even out the youngsters who sometimes play like gods and the next week like garbage men its also important for the hierarchy in the dressing room
8473279 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8473280 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8473281 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8473282 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8473283 the prosecution case has many weaknesses not least of which is the evidence of dr hussain himself but it is not so devoid of evidence that there is no case
8473284 being given a list of questions in advance provided him an opportunity to ensure that his evidence was consistent something no doubt a jury would take into account when assessing his evidence
8473285 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but it can always be better
8473286 thats why we are investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and hired 200 more inspectors with more to come in this fiscal year
8473287 we have an inspector in place on a daily basis when the plant is running to oversee the production process
8473288 while others characterize that as paperwork i characterize that as an important part of an effective inspection system the review of results from testing records and cooking temperature employed in a plant are fundamental that the processes employed by the plant are in control
8473289 we have an unwavering commitment to keep our food safe and we have excellent systems and processes in place but this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8473290 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world
8473291 this is a terrible tragedy and the system failed we will fix it
8473292 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but it can always be better thats why we are investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and hiring 200 more inspectors
8473293 no we are not thinking of taking part in any event we want to hold a preparatory camp for the players ahead of the important four test series against australia the details will be worked out soon in consultation with the concerned people
8473294 theres no change in the tour itinerary bangalore is to host the opening test from 9 13 october after the australians start the tour with a four day warm up tie against a select india xi at hyderabad from 2 5 october
8473295 i never write the yankees off until the seasons over and the standings are set
8473296 theyve been around too long and been in the playoffs for such a long time that were definitely not counting them out
8473297 it couldnt have been any worse the first two games but weve got to come back tomorrow
8473298 when i walked into this clubhouse i remembered getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away and i got a smile on my face because it just has a good memory to me
8473299 and i know this is the last year of the stadium so you think about that
8473300 two games doesnt make a lifetime it doesnt make a career
8473301 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankee series for me
8473302 im not writing a hall of fame career just yet but its been nice to get off to the start ive gotten off to it takes a little bit of pressure off
8473303 hes a beauty hes kind of i think the energizer bunny for this team
8473304 you know hes the one that stirs stuff up every team has got to have that guy
8473305 the seasons getting shorter we dont have many games left
8473306 we really have to come out and be perfect tomorrow
8473307 it appears that in trying to rush out ppm arbitron is sacrificing the accuracy of the data
8473308 arbitron has great respect and appreciation for the critical and unique role that and spanish language radio plays as a voice for the diverse communities across the country for those reasons we have had a long term commitment to working with spanish language broadcasters in a collaborative and supportive manner arbitrons role as an independent research company is to provide stations and advertisers with information that is based on the actual behavior of radio audiences that is what ppm delivers today we are confident that a fair understanding of the ppm system will demonstrate that it produces objective unbiased audience estimates the ppm is a more reliable survey instrument than the paper and pencil diary which relies heavily on memory and recall a paper and pencil ratings method often allows survey participants to overstate intentionally or unintentionally the time they spend with individual radio stations our ppm samples are designed to effectively represent the diversity of the markets we measure in terms of age sex race ethnicity and language preference overall hispanics and african americans have the highest listening levels in the ppm system broadcasters that serve ethnic audiences and who have embraced ppm are succeeding with the timely and detailed data that only ppm can deliver
8473309 on august 13 2008 four of the countrys top 10 hispanic markets including the number one market officially received their first pre currency ppm report broadcasters are now seeing that some spanish stations increase their ratings and rank position significantly in ppm
8473310 arbitron first debuted ppm ratings pre currency reports in new york last october and while an average of 8 percent of our hispanic panel has been replaced each month with brand new hispanics the ratings results in this market have not changed dramatically
8473311 today the hispanic ppm sample has also improved to a point where for the past several months in new york it has consistently out performed the diary on nearly every measure
8473312 our work is never done and we will continue to put forth an earnest effort to work together with broadcasters and agencies to improve areas that can benefit from it
8473313 at the same time that we look to the future i want to take this opportunity to point out the facts on ppm samples today in the wave of markets rolling out now ppm has the largest local market electronic media ratings panel ever maintained the hispanic sample size is more than twice the size of the current nielsen lpm hispanic panels
8473314 the spanish dominant hispanic ppm sample across all 10 deployed markets including new york and l a is over representative of the hispanic population and performs higher than the diary the average ppm proportionality in june 2008 was 119 percent where 100 is the goal the diary method achieved 101 percent in the last survey available survey for all of these markets
8473315 hispanic panelists agree to participate in our ppm panels in higher percentages than non black non hispanics we cannot say the same thing about the diary service
8473316 spanish dominant ppm panelists participate in higher percentages each day than any other panelists we cannot say the same thing about the diary service
8473317 ppm includes individuals in cell phone only homes whereas the diary does not these panelists tend to be hispanic and young the cell phone only population is a fast growing segment of the population and will be an increasingly important part of our panel
8473318 hispanic 18 34 year olds ppm panelist counts in june are at or above target in 8 out of 9 of our panels six are over 100 percent two are over 97 percent and only nassau suffolk is below target but climbing the diary service is not performing at this level
8473319 our hispanic customers have asked for additional panel characteristics and controls in ppm such as country of origin more discrete language weighting by age groups and in home in person coaching these measures and controls do not exist in our diary service and they would be yet another way that our electronic service will surpass all former radio ratings collection systems
8473320 despite the facts noted above a concern has been raised that ppm
8473321 be made right those who have not had an opportunity to see the facts but have seen the headlines in industry trade magazines might assume there is a bias against hispanics in the ratings the reality is that in ppm hispanics have the highest listening levels of any ethnic group hispanic stations have among the highest time spent listening in ppm
8473322 hispanic stations total weekly count of listeners increase virtually across the board in ppm
8473323 why dont my ratings look like the dairy the difference in ratings between diary and ppm has been quantified and it is because of the measurement tool
8473324 after electronic measurement the diary is the best radio survey method available and it does a terrific job of measuring core radio listening habits yet anyone who needs to understand why differences in radio listening exist between diary and ppm need only come to arbitron headquarters to view how the american public records their listening in the diaries the diary gets the job done well but there is better way to deliver more granular and timely results with accountability that advertisers demand
8473325 will the radio industry fire the person who suggests that radio traffic reports be placed online and easily made accessible by cell phone
8473326 will radio place that traffic report at a location where the consumer can access it without going through the stations home page
8473327 what of value will be left in its programming that the audience can respond to immediately when a cell phone responds immediately to them

8473336 many players apparently avoided getting involved in the market because the outlook is so unclear
8473337 the market is still in the process of pricing in an anticipated downturn in corporate earnings this fiscal year
8473338 this was a huge huge win for us simply because of the way we lost last night
8473339 we couldve afforded to lose but the way we lost last night you never know where thats going to lead you
8473340 you always want to see the big league team do well
8473341 it was a team effort its not about one guy or one pitcher we did a great job
8473342 were fighting some demons the demons of the past the rascals that have hung around us for a year
8473343 every time we lose a game like last night is a reminder of that
8473344 i think the race will come down to the end
8473345 the makeup of the guys in this clubhouse is that they can have a 10 game losing streak and put it all behind them
8473346 i thought fausto got better as the game wore on
8473347 i felt the best that i have all year tonight i had good stuff
8473348 its funny i had nothing in kansas city in my last start and won and tonight i lost
8473349 im pleased with the way their guys fought through things with all the adversity and trades and things

8473374 for matt and myself itd be nice knowing what the situation would be and be able to move forward with it the way i look at it more than anything the sooner it can happen the sooner we can get past the interviews and media coverage that goes with it and you can prepare for the game
8473375 we know its getting close and you get that anxiety and excitement knowing the decision has to be made soon i am sure coach understands that and hell make the decision as soon as its necessary
8473376 hopefully well get in enough snaps with the first offensive line that both can play
8473377 i just wanted to make sure kurt gets his timing with the ones for this game much like we did in kansas city
8473378 she gave him the money back there was no problem
8473379 i need soldiers and theyre not giving it to me they need to prioritize the needs of this community
8473380 tell me what democracy looks like this is what democracy looks like
8473381 i just cant imagine driving through my neighborhood at home and seeing a security checkpoint
8473382 its pretty neat we can still do this in this country
8473383 i realized at that moment that sure i may feel like crap but ive basically been a shitball to live with of late and im not doing anyone any favors by bellyachin all the fucking time
8473384 wouldnt it be cool if you and neil and alton could go riding together find or cook some really great food and just hang out
8473385 if you could have dinner with any famous person historical figure celebrity etc who would it be
8473386 indeed this is the perfect and complete glorification of god when one does not exult in his own righteousness but recognizing oneself as lacking true righteousness to be justified by faith alone in christ
8473387 it must be emphasized moreover that the original complaint for the cancellation of the eccs of the small scale mining permits of pgmc has already been rendered moot and academic as these already expired last april 2008
8473388 thus there being no more valid and existing small scale mining permits the issue of the cancellation of the eccs of the permits regarding over extraction of minerals and other violations by pgmc is no longer necessary
8473389 we had special board meeting on this and we deliberated on the complaint of the other party pgmc regarding orientals prospectus the legal cases were disclosed in the prospectus and we found no reason to deny the application
8473390 a reading of the foregoing grounds reveals the intention of the lawmakers to make the registration and issuance of securities dependent to a certain extent on the merits of the securities themselves and of the issuer to be determined by the sec
8473391 this measure was meant to protect the interest of the investing public against fraudulent and worthless securities and the sec is mandated by law to safeguard these interests following the policies and rules therefore provided
8473392 the absolute reliance on the full disclosure method in the registration of securities is therefore untenable
8473393 they cannot really point their fingers to the company the situation right now is beyond the control of oriental public investors are unwarranted victims
8473394 for example they want to invest in other mining claims they can do that as long as they disclose it to the public we dont impose penalties on deviation but on non disclosure
8473395 i dont think the price of the stock would go anywhere until these are resolved
8473396 the public is very trusting maybe thats why they still bought oriental shares despite pending cases its because they trust that regulators examined the risks very well
8473397 now in cases like this the regulators may need to look at the requirements again be more observant of what the situation really is and lay down more stringent rules
8473398 the philippines needs to develop a national program that will not only invite filipinos abroad to come home occasionally and render a few medical missions but to entice them to stay on and actually work in the country

8473400 we should remember the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain is a minority versus majority issue and if it would always be the tyranny of the majority that would be imposed the aspirations of the minority would never be realized
8473401 i had a guy come up from nfl madden and he told me i was their lowest rated player
8473402 and i was like thats nothing to me it makes me feel even better because this time next year i want to see what my rating is
8473403 its a lot of pressure but im ready for it
8473404 its really accelerated his development and hes worked really hard at it
8473405 could he play i think hes athletic enough but youd like to get him more seasoned before he had to be out there
8473406 this is a foundation for what we want to do this year
8473407 winning preseason games is not the important topic what its really about is playing your technique and fundamentals and getting that right before the season starts
8473408 winter must be cold for those with no warm memories

8473413 it is going to be awesome i am proud to say that atlanta is my new hometown and i am really excited
8473414 im not going to lie it still bothers me very much i was very unhappy with the deep referee and the way he officiated our first bout they constantly stood me up from dominant positions on the ground and tried to make it as difficult as possible to beat chonan i feel i completely dominated the first two rounds and the cut stoppage with two minutes left in the third round was bulls t i am glad our rematch will be in the ufc and im looking forward to having a fair fight i was really disappointed when i found out he was injured and couldnt fight me at ufc 85 but i understand that this is a fight business and people do get hurt im just glad the ufc decided to put this fight back together definitely this is a must win losing this fight is not an option for me it a win over chonan does a lot for me it avenges a past loss that should have never happened and it also moves me up the ufc rankings i am very thankful for this opportunity
8473415 this year were going out there to see how the first games prepare us for the sec because anyone who knows the southeastern conference in any sport knows its a grind day in and day out
8473416 the games are going to be difficult and we need to get these ladies prepared to play at that sort of level every time they step on the field
8473417 we have not found willing partners on the other side of the table

8473432 but the kitchen fioor has taken a beating there were a lot of slams
8473433 these were men who had been sentenced and found guilty by the supreme court walking around freely
8473434 it was evening around the time for the last prayer when armed men came and took my son islamuddin by force i have eye witness statements from nine people that he was there from that night until now my son has never been seen

8473439 mr president admit that you are wrong your intentions to keep this war ongoing is terribly wrong
8473440 its a really exciting time for our football team particularly the opportunity to go to the rose bowl and play against an outstanding team like ucla
8473441 the fact that we are breaking in a new quarterback makes it even more interesting i think
8473442 jon had some experience at this level with the two games hes played significant roles in and a lot of practice snaps hes practiced well and really improved taking care of the football
8473443 its obvious that youve got some guys like arian foster and i think a group of tailbacks that are very capable of being guys that make plays for us
8473444 last year was the first time demonte bolden walter fisher and dan williams had played any significant snaps i think those three guys are ready to have really good years for us
8473445 defensively having the experience returning in the secondary is a real plus for us
8473446 going on the road and ive talked about it with the team there is a mental and physical toughness you have to have to go and play and win in those settings
8473447 im very encouraged because of the maturity returning on this team
8473448 the new offense im excited to see it unveiled and to play in a real football game
8473449 weve made progress and were working to get the ball to our playmakers
8473450 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8473451 let us declare with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8473452 the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened
8473453 together vice president cheney donald rumsfeld and john mccain brought more than a century of experience to our foreign policy challenges
8473454 and what did that get us one international debacle after another
8473455 we deserve better than john mccains jokes about bombing iran or his denials that iraq has distracted us from afghanistan
8473456 we deserve better than a foreign policy thats more confrontational than george w bush and fails to address the complex challenges of a changing world we need leaders who recognize both our national interest and our shared challenges who will pay attention to both allies and enemies and who will truly make america safer and stronger i can think of none better than barack obama and joe biden
8473457 when i returned from iraq i realized we didnt just need change over there we also needed to change how we treat our veterans here at home
8473458 for eight long years weve had a president who rushed to stand with soldiers at political rallies but abandoned them at walter reed weve had a president who spent billions on private contractors but not on body armor for all our troops
8473459 for the past eight years the man in the oval office has tipped his hat over his eyes kicked back his chair and snoozed at his desk while his vice president conspired with oil industry cronies
8473460 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8473461 yes we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time
8473462 were counting on you pennsylvania if you dont deliver your votes to barack obama its over before the polls even close in montana
8473463 the fact that the first stop were making is in beaver shows how seriously the obama campaign is taking pennsylvania
8473464 we know this race is going to be close and we know sen mccain will be making an all out effort to win the state
8473465 i know if theres any way that she could come back and teach i know she would do it in a second
8473466 i heard that your husband was deployed and i thought i could give you a break and bring over dinner
8473467 when she came to us initially we thought she was just going to lend us her name
8473468 but it turns out that she was a volunteer who got down into the trenches with us to fund raise
8473469 she was always there rooting you on no matter what no matter whether it was for an exam or at a football game
8473470 it was joe the boys and the state of delaware
8473471 we where tired of getting yelled at all the time
8473472 we didnt think they would think a teacher would do it we are so sorry to miss romonison she should not be in trouble for something we did we wont do it no more
8473473 there were a couple of the jurors who had decided already that she must be guilty because she was arrested and it was in all the news
8473474 i believe in the interest of justice that a new trial should be granted
8473475 i believe the verdict at trial would have been different
8473476 if this were the standard all you would need would be someone writing an anonymous note to the judge or the defense attorney to get a new trial
8473477 given that weve got one week before school starts this looks to be the best solution going into this school year
8473478 the spirit in which we want to negotiate is that no one is worse off under the arrangement than was planned before
8473479 that was not done in this case thats very unfortunate and thats not the way the school district wishes to conduct itself
8473480 which could cause panic to an individual if he or she were unaware of the possible cause due to a lack of knowledge of the spraying
8473481 exacerbated by the sounds of low flying aircraft and the presence of a mist of unknown origin
8473482 a direct correlation between the infection rate of mosquitoes and human illness
8473483 being able to spray is a very positive step to protect pennsvylania citizens
8473484 sympathetic to our position that there was a gross lack of notice
8473485 initial indications from our mosquito traps in montgomery county suggest that the spray was highly effective
8473486 if people are concerned and want to take additional steps weve listed those steps
8473487 the risk of virus from these mosquitoes is greater than any risk from this very low level of pesticide
8473488 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary said mccain spokesman tucker bounds
8473489 our brave soldiers were killed because of mccain and president bushs reckless incompetence
8473490 allomap can help contribute to an appropriate treatment plan by identifying those patients not experiencing post operative heart transplant rejection
8473491 it is an example of how advancements in science and technology are leading to new medical care diagnostics
8473492 these new findings have several clinical implications besides the impairment of sexual function in these young men
8473493 the lack of testosterone during these critical years may lead to diminished bone mass and the lack of development or lose of skeletal muscle in addition these patients may gain more weight with an average body mass index of 38 they already were obese and become more insulin resistant
8473494 also patients with low testosterone and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high concentrations of c reactive protein
8473495 which increases their risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease above and beyond the risk associated with diabetes
8473496 while obesity contributes to the association of type 2 diabetes and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism hh the association is not dependent entirely on obesity
8473497 in our first study of diabetic men we found that 31 percent of lean type 2 diabetics also had hh so it is likely that factors other than obesity contribute to hh possibly insulin resistance
8473498 whether obesity or insulin resistance is the major determinant of hh has to be addressed in future studies and the pathogenesis of hh needs to be defined
8473499 whats unique about this program is that as researchers we are first gaining insight into the concerns and issues of these mothers and then enlisting them to help us come up with ways to increase the likelihood that they will try to breastfeed exclusively
8473500 this is much different from the usual route where the researchers come up with a solution beforehand and then conduct a study to see if it was correct
8473501 we are determined to make inroads and demonstrate real strategies that women can use
8473502 we know that breastfeeding works and that mothers and fathers want whats best for their babies our goal is to identify what a new mother needs for success and how that can be provided
8473503 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them
8473504 relapse or the resumption of active drug taking and drug seeking is very common in drug addicts
8473505 addiction related brain changes and behaviors seem to be hardwired and semipermanent and there are limited treatment options our data suggest that rather than trying to block the process of increasing dendritic spine density we may actually want to look at treatments that try to enhance this process
8473506 this suggests the exciting possibility that mef2 proteins may control expression of key genes that modulate drug related brain changes and behavior
8473507 if we understand which genes are influenced by mef2 we can intervene and try to help the system resist or reverse these sensitization processes

8473517 we had a deal it collapsed 11 days prior to close

8473520 if they know your method of financing has run into a snag they will give you some time

8473539 since 1999 new evidence has seriously weakened the case that carbon emissions are the main cause of global warming and by 2007 the evidence was pretty conclusive that carbon played only a minor role we know for sure carbon emissions are not a significant cause
8473540 twenty first century mysticism and superstition is finding expression in the big environmental debates deep green extremists yearn for a return to a pre industrial society before the enlightenment when faith and dogma prevailed over rational thinking and evidence based science

8473594 si dovrebbe sempre tenere a mente sempre ricordare il punto di inizio di questa crisi lattacco georgiano contro lossezia del sud
8473595 non pu non sollevare dubbi che una missione umanitaria sia affidata a navi da guerra
8473596 tecnicamente possibile la costituzione russa prevede un allargamento della federazione a chi ne fa richiesta ma non in agenda
8473597 if we leave before this government resigns it means we are defeated
8473598 especially since hurricanes katrina and rita we take every storm seriously
8473599 this one does seem that it is going to be a threat and so we are in constant communication with our local state and federal partners and have our plan in place to roll out whatever we need to roll out at whatever time we need to do so
8473600 fifty hours from when it is projected that there will be tropical storm or hurricane force winds felt in the area that is when we determine when to call for the evacuation
8473601 this is a holiday weekend so we are asking people to pay attention to weather forecasts and news so that they can be ready in the event that there is an evacuation called for
8473602 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8473603 and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together
8473604 i think we did pretty good we were able to move the chains we came out in the second half and were able to keep the drive alive and get a field goal for a 10 3 lead before we came out
8473605 you always are supposed to do better running the ball
8473606 but you cant sit here and say well buffalo ran the ball on pittsburghs defense so no matter what you guys are going to have to run the ball on pittsburgh
8473607 they even were using some blitzes to stop the run so we had to get ourselves back to being more balanced
8473608 thats when you saw that fourth series where we decided to throw it three times in a row and we got the touchdown
8473609 they know youre going to run it but goal line play is all about attitude
8473610 and the good thing is that touchdown came over the right side it lets people know that we dont always have to run to the left side
8473611 that was an important play as for the overall preseason stats they dont mean anything because running the ball is about getting a feel in the first half and finishing teams off in the third and fourth quarters as long as ive been coaching preseason rushing stats have never meant anything
8473612 as it relates to recovery fema is still the same or similar organization that not only deals with evacuations and post event but the long term challenges of a recovery and were still struggling with that
8473613 to be prepared to where theyre not trying to scramble to get thousands of people down there
8473614 the lessons from katrina were very profound and pre deployment and pre positioning of materials was one of the greatest lessons learned
8473615 we are worried that if 300 000 people are evacuated we will have people right here at the chapter saying provide us shelter
8473616 sure we could be farther behind but we could be ahead
8473617 it doesnt feel good to go out there and lose
8473618 especially when we know were better and were capable of doing a lot of good things
8473619 i dont know what it is a lot of them have been the solo variety it gives our team a chance to stay in the game
8473620 you play this game long enough and you know teams are going to hit skids like this its just part of the game but its still frustrating to go through it
8473621 we have to worry about whats going on here if we take care of our business the standings will come out if we keep winning were not worried about the diamondbacks just like theyre probably not worried about us
8473622 st matthews anglican church is a community of believers set alight by the fire of god called to experience and share the fullness of life in jesus christ and the healing power of the holy spirit
8473623 that god would continue to pour out his holy spirit on us so that we would seek him more deeply and go out to share his love and grace with others resulting in a community of believers committed to spiritual growth discipleship and outreach
8473624 whether the diocese of new westminster has the right to unilaterally replace these duly elected trustees and move to seize control of the parishes assets is in dispute
8473625 the trustees of both st matthews and st matthias and st luke are meeting and seeking legal advice regarding their response to the diocese
8473626 however we note with interest that the diocese has chosen to act only against the two smaller parishes and not the larger anic parishes st johns shaughnessy and church of the good shepherd in vancouver another concern is that the notice alleging a crisis was signed by the bishop on july 10th but not served on the parishes for six weeks after the lambeth conference had concluded
8473627 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8473628 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8473629 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8473630 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8473631 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8473637 no one ever predicted that clownfish would be attracted to the scent of leaves i just figured they might like beach water
8473638 i saw the islands had heavy vegetation and i said lets give it a shot
8473639 this shows that you cant separate the marine and terrestrial environments you have to consider them working together
8473640 i would really like to see if this is happening in other fish
8473641 its really easy to speculate that without the leaves clownfish might not be able to find their homes

8473643 while the ocean vessel pirate was commercial fishing for dhufish this great white shark was hooked in the mouth
8473644 it only resisted slightly for 5 minutes before it came up alongside the boat to have a look just long enough for one of the crew members to slip a rope around its tail
8473645 and thats when the fun began the shark took off towing the 35 foot fishing boat backwards through the water at an estimated 7 knots
8473646 just like in jaws the boat was taking on water over the stern and the crew watched in horror as the shark would actually jump completely out of the water at times
8473647 this went on for an hour before the shark finally drowned

8473650 in the deep ocean there is a strong interaction between viruses and prokaryotes which helps sustain the deep sea ecosystems independently of the nutrient inputs coming from the surface waters

8473657 the whale meat should be returned to its senders at their own expense
8473658 whales as living organisms at the top of the marine ecosystem are extremely important for protecting the ocean environment and we should therefore pay close attention to how they are treated
8473659 the fisheries agency also needs to strive in future to protect the marine ecosystem by revising its own lethal research programme which has led to the deaths of almost 8 700 whales in whale sanctuaries across the southern oceans and move on to non lethal means of conducting research on whales

8473765 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8473766 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8473767 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8473768 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8473769 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8473770 if he didnt run that way he wouldnt be the kind of back he is
8473771 hes been able to run that way and not be banged up and i think he will continue that
8473772 we need to play them enough that we have a feeling for if they can play and if they can contribute or not
8473773 it will be interesting to see what he can do for four quarters
8473774 i think he showed the world that hes capable of being an every down back
8473775 anything extra you get out of barber it may shock the world
8473776 you know what youre getting out of him every play
8473777 the spark he gives i didnt think hed be able to give us that as a starter just because you play that role you come in that second series its something special but he does it as a starter i think hes going to be a big part of what were doing

8473782 i thought david did a wonderful job of integrating his understanding of life in god and god in life
8473783 ive had students tell me the course was a life changing experience
8473784 in our evangelical world we take the authority of the bible seriously traditionally women have been excluded from ordination and things of that sort david really took the text seriously and led people through it to show them you can support gods call to women in all calls to leadership including ordination that was a major contribution

8473792 its not a great result at home when you should have done better
8473793 we gave away the ball way too much in the second half
8473794 a bit of lack of concentration could have cost us the game but we won and if we play well defensively down there theres no reason we shouldnt win
8473795 i think we showed were the better team when we moved the ball around but it wasnt our best game
8473796 we had chances in the second half and didnt score
8473797 but we didnt show all we have i think well do better in the home leg
8473798 i saw lots of amateur situations from the men in white the impact red and white real esteli and yellow and black the officials
8473799 but a win is a win the 1 0 is better than it seems because it forces them to win a game and if we can score an away goal it could be a huge advantage for us

8473810 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8473811 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8473812 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8473813 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8473814 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running

8473830 welcome home thanks for thanks for preserving our right to go on not giving a fuck
8473831 one would think that when the only man running for the post of mca president says the party may have to pull out of the barisan nasional if umno continues to champion the concept of ketuanan melayu it should make the front page of all newspapers
8473832 the rest of the chinese dailies offered up only today some muted reaction to the candidates suggestion
8473833 but has he really spoken out and articulated the frustrations of the chinese community
8473834 what is the reaction of umno towards such a strong statement from an mca vice president and cabinet minister
8473835 because it appears the statement so far is meant only for the eyes of the chinese community
8473836 it is really insulting to members to think that in this age of multi culturalism anyone would choose to put on a show in the chinese newspapers for the chinese community
8473837 he should also officially issue statements that that will be mcas policy should he become president

8473842 the aladdin board carefully considered vector capitals unsolicited proposals and unanimously determined that such proposals are not in the best interests of aladdins shareholders
8473843 we believe that these unsolicited proposals are opportunistic significantly undervalue aladdin and do not fully recognize the value of our company or its drm business
8473844 as part of our review the board and its advisors evaluated the vector capital proposals in the context of the companys recent financial performance our current business plan as well as additional alternatives available to the company which would enable it to enhance shareholder value
8473845 we are confident that through execution of its strategy aladdin will create substantially greater value for shareholders than either of vector capitals proposals vector capital fails to recognize the intrinsic value of the companys business and strategic initiatives

8473847 latino immigrants tend to come to this country as young adults and thats the time when they tend to start having families
8473848 for the bulk of hispanic public school students english acquisition is not their educational challenge
8473849 we have a large hispanic and latino population do we ignore them and not educate them so they later become part of our welfare and criminal justice system or do we educate them and help them contribute back to society id rather find a positive way to help them become anything they choose to be
8473850 on one hand i hear a lot of frustrations from teachers about their population of students
8473851 but at the same time we seem to be struggling as educators to step up to meet the needs of this very diverse population
8473852 a lot of people who have become teachers recently say it puts a strain on schools
8473853 but it gives teachers jobs also when hispanics move here and become students in our schools we get that much more money from the state i look at it as being a very positive situation
8473854 a lot of people who have become teachers recently say it puts a strain on schools

8473862 not just that since the show is about the making of akshay as the superstar he makes an appearance in all the songs of the other actresses however katrina will be the only one who will get to perform with akki singh is kinng is their fourth successful film together and they are cashing in on it katrina flew in from new york last night and will be in mumbai for three days where she will shoot for the show along with akki everything is hush hush
8473863 salman and ajay were initially supposed to shoot together but as salman was busy with veer and 10 ka dum he gave dates a few days later on the other hand as ajay had already blocked his dates he couldnt shoot with salman
8473864 ajays shoot look and styling was immaculate designer ana singh did his clothes when it was salmans turn to show up and shoot a couple of days later the actor wanted to check out how devgan looked after seeing the snapshots sallu refused to shoot saying that he needed time to prepare vipul shah was present at the time and sallu told him he wanted to look hotter than ajay
8473865 i really dont want to compromise with anything in this movie since a veteran actor like sharath kumar has agreed to do the film that should be an added inspiration for us to reach beyond the borders more than half of the movie will shot in afghanistan because the script has been written with a backdrop of terrorism movies like kabul express did really well in the box office so the movie will be a sort of an experiment in the south i dont remember any south indian movie being shot in afghanistan
8473866 officials in afghanistan have given us a clear picture of the whole scenario in the country we have followed all their rules and regulations to shoot a movie in their land
8473867 we had to go through many contacts to reach sharath and then when we told him that the film needs to be shot in afghanistan he was a bit hesitant

8473873 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8473874 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8473875 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the english language be the vice presidents office is on the phone he said as the crowd roared
8473876 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8473877 or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8473878 now after six long years the administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8473879 hes done a lot for working class people and he has a lot of great foreign policy experience
8473880 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8473881 lets declare together with one voice right here right now barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8473882 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since
8473883 has convinced me that barack obama is the man for the job
8473884 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8473885 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8473886 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8473911 s yo creo que los compa eros nosotros estamos conscientes de que no es f cil simplemente aplicarnos es de cada partido entregarnos al cien para que nosotros lo hagamos f cil no simplemente con pisar la cancha creamos que ya al contrario creo que este equipo est bien consciente de eso

8473914 s te digo hay veces que es complicado tampoco es excusa pero de verdad que a veces te saca mucho de onda ese tipo de esas situaciones pero estamos de locales y yo creo que tenemos todo para ganar
8473915 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family

8473917 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the english language be the vice presidents office is on the phone

8473919 this is the time as americans together we get back up
8473920 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8473921 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8473922 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8473923 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8473924 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8473925 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8473926 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8473927 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8473928 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8473929 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8473930 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need

8473954 whether the brightest galaxies in clusters grew substantially in the last few billion years is intensely debated our observations show that in this time these galaxies have increased their mass by 50
8473955 most surprising is that in three of the four groups the brightest galaxy also has a bright companion galaxy these galaxy pairs are merging systems
8473956 the stars in these galaxies are already old and so we must conclude that the recent merging did not produce a new generation of stars

8473973 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8473974 i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8473975 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for president of the united states by acclamation

8474013 gas prices are too fucking high as you know i do own my own jet and i have been having flying back and forth to la pursuing my acting career
8474014 now if im flying back and forth like twice in a month thats like 200 000 or 250 000 round trip fuck that im back on american airlines right now ok

8474016 i want to give a shout out to all my saudi arabian brothers and sisters and all my brothers and sisters from all the countries that have oil if you could all please send me some oil for my jet i would truly appreciate it
8474017 but right now can you believe it i am actually flying commercial thats how high gas prices are ok so i feel you look im at the gate right now
8474018 this is proof that gas prices are too high we need to do something about it so tell whoever the next president is that we need to bring gas back down
8474019 get this one iran is changing its cars to run on natural gas and were not doing a thing here theyre doing this to use less oil and sell it for 120 a barrel we can switch our cars to natural gas and stop sending our dollars to foreign countries
8474020 there are not going to be big bids on these tracts
8474021 this is not what the oil and gas companies want to produce more oil from the coasts
8474022 how concerned are you about rising gas and energy prices
8474023 in order to reduce the price of gas should drilling be allowed in offshore oil wells off the coasts of california florida and other states
8474024 will be the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind

8474032 as well as talking about policies talk about the stance they will take if they happen to be the balance of power holder
8474033 some balance of power holders like to see themselves as honest brokers and negotiators compromise whereas others are more inclined to push for a fairly narrow range of policies
8474034 theres absolutely nothing wrong with having accountability and thats what we have
8474035 running around telling staff this is a damn mess and were all failing is not the way you bring about change in a school
8474036 youve actually got to motivate people and one of things ive found is that youve got to tell students in that particular school we are a good school you are great students look at the good things you are doing
8474037 you dont walk around saying god were all terrible it doesnt motivate anybody
8474038 what people need to understand is that in south australia we already have a professional pay scheme which is called the elevated skills teachers program
8474039 its been highly successful in making sure that we keep experienced teachers in the classroom
8474040 we are concerned about the attraction retention provisions that are in place and were working with the state government to seek improvements via our enterprise bargaining negotiations
8474041 obviously businesses appraise where they are at on quite a regular basis and certainly reading the literature that has been released by australian paper in my discussions with them i dont think theres any cause for concern at the moment
8474042 were continuing to get questions from clients brokers and consultants about whats going on
8474043 and its important for customers to know that were maintaining our operations
8474044 great west has been in a segment of the market cigna has wanted to get into but hasnt been as successful as wed like
8474045 what often happens with acquisitions is that people are let go and systems shut down but were not doing any of that
8474046 theyre telling us nothing will change and thats proven to be the case
8474047 acquisitions are creating super insurers that pay out as little as possible and take higher premiums its like were negotiating off the sticker price of a car
8474048 as they grow more sophisticated their leverage is more political
8474049 the presence of a number of strong competitors in the colorado springs marketplace is the key to holding growth in premiums down and to providing a wide range of reimbursement sources for providers so that they cant be played one against the other
8474050 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined
8474051 they discover that they must work to keep some form of economic balance and when they cant theyre lost
8474052 i paid the bills whether i ate or didnt whether i went to the doctor or not
8474053 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
8474054 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
8474055 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
8474056 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
8474057 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
8474058 we already know he is a rock star we already know he can bring 85 000 people together in a stadium he has done it multiple times he needs to talk to people who havent made up their minds yet
8474059 its likely that the campaign would do it differently if it had to do it again because the decision was made before the european trip
8474060 i have heard some of the concerns and criticism that its such a big venue

8474064 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
8474065 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed

8474083 this was a huge huge win for us simply because of the way we lost last night
8474084 we couldve afforded to lose but the way we lost last night you never know where thats going to lead you
8474085 you always want to see the big league team do well
8474086 it was a team effort its not about one guy or one pitcher we did a great job
8474087 were fighting some demons the demons of the past the rascals that have hung around us for a year
8474088 every time we lose a game like last night is a reminder of that
8474089 i think the race will come down to the end
8474090 lets get past the name calling lets get past all this pointless debate about blaming someone here or blaming someone there and lets get on with the business
8474091 our teachers are our greatest resource australia has and what i would say is that we are committed to investing more in quality teaching across australia
8474092 we want a quality revolution in australian schools but were going to be there for the quantity as well which is the additional funds that will be invested
8474093 we believe absolutely from the pit of our stomachs that this is the right thing to do and we intend to prosecute this
8474094 these laws were passed in 2004 and 2008 is the last year that the states actually have the opportunity to comply with the laws
8474095 it is law today that as a condition of school funding states have got to provide plain language report cards to parents and also publish the performance of those schools
8474096 the real challenge for mr rudd is that given 2008 is the last year that the states have to comply will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply
8474097 the one area that we will want to discuss in more depth with the commonwealth is the issue of the so called performance tables or league tables
8474098 this is something weve not supported in the past not because we dont want parents to have more information but because measuring these things is exceedingly difficult
8474099 people have a right to form blocks of like interests and unions are one of those forums
8474100 lets get past the name calling lets get past all this pointless debate about blaming someone here or blaming someone there and lets get on with the business
8474101 earlier today education minister julia gillard said only similar schools will be compared as a way of identifying why some are performing better than others
8474102 and he told the unions to get on board or risk being left in the past
8474103 lets get past the name calling lets get past all this pointless debate about blaming someone here or blaming someone there and lets get on with the business
8474104 our teachers are our greatest resource australia has and what i would say is that we are committed to investing more in quality teaching across australia

8474123 to believe that he will preserve us is indeed a means of preservation god will certainly preserve us and make a way of escape for us out of the temptation should we fall we are to pray for what god has already promised our requests are to be regulated by his promises and commands faith embraces the promises and so finds relief
8474124 in order that we may also be glorified with him

8474126 blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account rejoice and be glad for your reward is great in heaven for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you
8474127 if the world hates you know that it has hated me before it hated you if you were of the world the world would love you as its own but because you are not of the world but i chose you out of the world therefore the world hates you remember the word that i said to you a servant is not greater than his master if they persecuted me they will also persecute you if they kept my word they will also keep yours but all these things they will do to you on account of my name because they do not know him who sent me
8474128 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also

8474181 defenders of liberty should champion the cause of the brutalized ossetians who demand independence from georgia when president bush says the territorial integrity of georgia must be respected and gop presidential candidate john mccain declares today were all georgians they are putting politics above justice

8474283 so is your god to stupid to know how to save the people he supposedly created that need logic and proof or is he just a weak god and unable to do the needful
8474284 why wont god prove himself or give those who dont believe the understanding to do so

8474286 democracy is a poor system of government at best the only thing that can honestly be said in its favor is that it is about eight times as good as any other method the human race has ever tried democracys worst faults is that its leaders are likely to reflect the faults and virtues of their constituents a depressingly low level but what else can you expect
8474287 there was so much to grok so little to grok from
8474288 you will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart i will be found by you
8474289 rara vez percibimos que estamos rodeados por lo extraordinario los milagros suceden a nuestro alrededor las se ales de dios nos muestran su camino los ngeles piden ser o dos sin embargo no prestamos atenci n a nada de esto las pr cticas religiosas tradicionales son importantes nos hacen participar junto a los dem s de una experiencia comunitaria de adoraci n y oraci n pero nunca debemos olvidar que una experiencia espiritual es una experiencia pr ctica de amor son numerosos los conflictos que nos acompa an en nuestra b squeda pero debemos vencer nuestros miedos porque el camino se hace mediante la experiencia diaria del amor
8474290 i havent been home from work yet and i just thought well ill just pop in and fill up the tank just to see and there were more cars than i expected actually

8474292 we sell storm curtains so our business went crazy today
8474293 it went up down the street the dodge store right down the street it was 3 44 a gallon this morning and i think its about i guess 3 62
8474294 it was 3 45 this morning now its 3 69
8474295 as the days unfold folks will come to appreciate more and more that barack is no bill clinton we know bill clinton barack you aint got the stuff
8474296 i would rather vote for a boring old war hero than an anti american racist
8474297 for starters they will have to reluctantly concede that baracks attacks on bill clintons presidency were wrong
8474298 bingo clinton was masterful and not one news station ran with the never ending standing ovation he got he also wrote his own speech lol barack must be seething michelle every time they showed her looked like she just swallowed a rotten peanut clinton was masterful and not one news station ran with the never ending standing ovation he got the dnc has not given any intelligent reasonable thinking person a reason to vote for obama reagan and particularly the bush family all the way back to prescott bush have always hated fdr and were determined to gut the new deal prescott bush was even a part of an assassination conspiracy against fdr all of the privatization theyve been trying to ram through as well as de regulation is part of that plan lucky for us that bush hasnt been totally successful i think mac will be reasonable without a republican congressional majority regarding regulations etc there is a traitor roosevelt on the rules and bylaws committee that fell over backwards for bambi we are fdr reagan clinton mccain democrats this coalition also includes puma we are deciding this election as we have decided every election in modern history obama doesnt meet the min requirements for the job of president we are looking for a much better experienced candidate in a time great of crisis we are looking for a candidate with core values and convictions that have passed many laws and stood behind them despite opposition we are looking for a candidate that values country before party country before self we want a candidate who will defend america and will never surrender and will never cause america to be humiliated is that what you heard good it was meant that you were to just think that look below the surface read between the lines and you will see that the clintons set the bar for obama and mccain obama soetoro will never meet them if you truly were a freedom fighter you would understand this but you are not you are a faker just like the one i think its time to unite behind our nominee barack obama both clintons have now given ringing endorsements to obama bill clinton has said obama is ready to be president its time for the puma folks to follow the clintons lead and support obama biden get a life the majority of posters are now officially john mccain supporters republican before i kiss azz and vote for obama
8474299 the situation at our channel is about to blow up
8474300 i do know that 25 000 marines in a province again are probably in excess of the need especially after iraqi provincial control assumes responsibilities for security
8474301 the taliban are growing bolder in their tactics and clearly doing their best to exploit security gaps where they exist
8474302 weve seen families slaughtered weve seen policemen rounded up and executed with shots to the back of the head in the soccer stadium just to make the point and so thats what we risk if we dont somehow take advantage of those gains and maintain the momentum in that area

8474315 we deal with those that are uninsured but this is something for businesses large and small
8474316 its for individuals for people whove never had health insurance because theyve never been able to afford it
8474317 the situation at our channel is about to blow up
8474318 we hire smart people who are passionate about their love of politics and love of news
8474319 have you been sleeping for the past couple of months
8474320 i feel so comforted by the fact that youre an independent
8474321 i bet everybody at msnbc has independent on their voting cards oh were down the middle now
8474322 i think we did pretty good we were able to move the chains we came out in the second half and were able to keep the drive alive and get a field goal for a 10 3 lead before we came out
8474323 you always are supposed to do better running the ball
8474324 but you cant sit here and say well buffalo ran the ball on pittsburghs defense so no matter what you guys are going to have to run the ball on pittsburgh
8474325 they even were using some blitzes to stop the run so we had to get ourselves back to being more balanced
8474326 thats when you saw that fourth series where we decided to throw it three times in a row and we got the touchdown
8474327 they know youre going to run it but goal line play is all about attitude
8474328 and the good thing is that touchdown came over the right side it lets people know that we dont always have to run to the left side
8474329 that was an important play as for the overall preseason stats they dont mean anything because running the ball is about getting a feel in the first half and finishing teams off in the third and fourth quarters as long as ive been coaching preseason rushing stats have never meant anything
8474330 these rains will likely produce life threatening flash floods and mud slides

8474335 there is a russia narrative that we were weak in the 90s but now we are back and we are not going to take it anymore but being angry and seeking revanchist victory is not the sign of a strong nation it is the sign of a weak one
8474336 russia is going to have to come to terms with the reality it can either integrate with the world or it can be a self isolated bully but it cant be both and thats a choice russia has to have
8474337 they are kind of giddy they will need to sober up
8474338 when they sober up they will see that it is not the u s that has done things to them its that they have done things to themselves
8474339 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel economic and political losses
8474340 no one asked what impact its actions had on the russian stock market there was no russian stock market
8474341 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8474342 the georgian people won their freedom after years of tyranny and they can count on the friendship of the united states
8474343 three american presidents bush clinton and bush have all in their own way sought to encourage russias integration with the wider world this is a good thing it was the right set of policies
8474344 russia has now put all of that at risk because russian cannot simultaneously behave like the soviet union toward its neighbors like this is 1968 and act as if it is 2008 when it comes to the wto
8474345 there are areas where we have common interest with russia and we want to work with them the question is whether russia has an ability to work with us

8474374 we did drop a lot of revenue but we still had fixed costs of doing much bigger business in the second half of the year
8474375 we have addressed that now and reduced our fixed costs through back end processes
8474376 you can put this down to a really big tidy up over the last 12 months
8474377 we were looking to break even or have a slight profit but the market has been pretty tough and we have gone through a lot of changes with vendors resellers and internal redundancies i think things have now settled down where we are going compared to the last year is chalk and cheese
8474378 protect yourself from real estate and mortgage fraud preserving the american dream of homeownership
8474379 i audit hundreds of real estate files every year and this file takes the cake
8474380 if anyone is looking for a trademark signature of mortgage fraud i think theyll find it here from fabrication of bruce mcclellans assets and making outrageous claims about mcclellans guaranteed return on his investment to making no real attempt to sell the investment property and taking cash back at closing here we have what appears to be knowingly committed mortgage fraud
8474381 what lindsey hunters company is under investigation for having done ruins lives destroys neighborhoods and is calculable in our current mortgage meltdown and housing crisis
8474382 people generally do not commit real estate or mortgage fraud for the sheer joy of ripping off the system although in lindsey hunters case with all the benefits he receives by virtue of playing in the nba if he did it then that would appear to be the primary motivation

8474385 essentially a major upgrade to part of telstras existing network
8474386 the opposition has made it clear that if 4 7 billion of taxpayers money is to be utilized then we need commensurate public policy gains were not about imposing new burdens on taxpayers shareholders or corporations were about saying if you want the money there are strings attached
8474387 and we believe that achieving effective structural separation has to be one of those things because the
8474388 overseas experience has already proven that separation does not work it increases costs reduces efficiencies limits future innovation and most importantly kills off investment
8474389 he sol trujillo is genuinely proud and understandably proud that they have been able to maintain profitability because of the poor market structure and poor regulation weve had in australia
8474390 telstra is puzzled by mr billsons reported comments given that this wednesday morning the office of the leader of the opposition confirmed that structural separation of telstra is explicitly not coalition policy
8474391 it would be totally irresponsible for mr billson to suggest that telstra should be further separated given that the coalition sold shares to 1 4 million shareholders who paid billions of dollars to the government as part of the t3 process only a few months ago telstra is not and will not be a political play thing
8474392 the opposition repeats that it seeks to impose no new burden on telstra or its shareholders but if telstra puts its hand out for 4 7 billion of taxpayer money commensurate public policy gains are required
8474393 ironically the speech mr quilty has reacted to called for greater dialogue and openness about the broadband choices australia faces and how little attention is being paid to the national and consumer interests under labors vague troubled and stalled nbn tender process

8474429 there are still rivalries in the west but also great coalitions
8474430 ich sharp contractions in the money supply and recession are two spokes on the same wheel
8474431 the us money supply has experienced the sharpest contraction in modern history heightening the risk of a wall street crunch and a severe economic slowdown in coming months data compiled by lombard street research shows that the m3 broad money
8474432 monthly data for july show that the broad money growth has almost collapsed
8474433 the overall debt burden in the us economy is currently at record levels raising concerns that a recession if it occurs could set off a sharp downward spiral
8474434 the biggest one month fall since modern records began in 1959
8474435 over time inflation will be the last problem that the fed will have to face as a severe us recession and global slowdown will lead to a sharp reduction in inflationary pressures in the u s slack in goods markets with demand falling below supply will reduce pricing power of firms slack in labor markets with unemployment rising will reduce wage pressures and labor costs pressures a fall in commodity prices of the order of 30 will further reduce inflationary pressure the fed will have to cut the fed funds rate much more as severe downside risks to growth and to financial stability will dominate any short term upward inflationary pressures leaving aside the risk of a collapse of the us dollar given this easier monetary policy the fed funds rate may end up being closer to 0 than 1 by the end of this financial crisis and severe recession cycle
8474436 recent government statistics show that only between 10 and 20 of the rebate dollars were spent the rebates added nearly 80 billion to the permanent national debt but less than 20 billion to consumer spending here are the facts tax rebates of 78 billion arrived in the second quarter of the year the governments recent gdp figures show that the level of consumer outlays only rose by an extra 12 billion or 15 of the lost revenue the rest went into savings including the paydown of debt consumer outlays increased to 36 billion from 24 billion so the additional 12 billion of consumer spending was less than 16 of the extra 76 billion of disposable personal income by comparison savings rose by 62 billion or five times as much this experience confirms earlier studies showing that one time tax rebates are not a cost effective way to increase economic activity
8474437 the recent plunge in m3 ed m3 is the broadest measure of money used by economists to estimate the entire supply of money makes it likely that credit lines have been fully tapped and or banks have simply turned off the spigot liquidity shrinks by the day banks scrambling to refinance long term debt are going to have a very tough go of it weekly unemployment claims are soaring consumers out of a job are going to have a tough time paying bills those looking for a bottom in these conditions are simply barking up the wrong tree
8474438 the problem began in the roaring twenties when the fed made money plentiful by keeping interest rates low money seemed to be plentiful but what was actually flowing freely was credit or debt production was up more than wages so more goods were available than money to pay for them but people could borrow money was so easy to get that people were borrowing just to invest taking out short term low interest loans that were readily available from the banks
8474439 the fed began selling securities in the open market reducing the money supply by reducing the reserves available for backing loans the result was a huge liquidity squeeze a lack of available money short term loans suddenly became available only at much higher interest rates making buying stock on margin much less attractive as fewer people bought stock prices fell removing the incentive for new buyers to purchase stocks bought by earlier buyers on margin the stock market crashed overnight
8474440 the federal reserve definitely caused the great depression by contracting the amount of currency in circulation by one third from 1929 to 1933

8474485 last night i discovered a new new york favorite in park blue
8474486 if there was any deep division in the music scene in 1977 it wasnt people scratching their heads at less than stellar releases from kansas foreigner styx or steely dan and neil young it was the demise of live music as disco came to prominence i could make the argument that kansas nugent and other arena acts gained fans because people who hated disco really hated disco myself included
8474487 john jansens comments made me think of some of the bad things white people have done timothy mcveigh terry nichols the unabomber not to mention almost all the serial killers in the u s and all those arab terrorists theyre caucasian i just dont think we can afford to have white people running this country they are way too dangerous
8474488 i really used to be amazed how these individuals could be so blatant about who they really are and yet have their assemblies still pour money into their pockets so they can live like movie stars and then you have those who are of the new faith cashians and followers of santa christ
8474489 the heartbreaking story of a man and his last chance at bat
8474490 i have been standing on first base for 18 years and i just wanted to steal second
8474491 if there was any deep division in the music scene in 1977 it wasnt people scratching their heads at less than stellar releases from kansas foreigner styx or steely dan and neil young it was the demise of live music as disco came to prominence i could make the argument that kansas nugent and other arena acts gained fans because people who hated disco really hated disco myself included

8474493 i really used to be amazed how these individuals could be so blatant about who they really are and yet have their assemblies still pour money into their pockets so they can live like movie stars and then you have those who are of the new faith cashians and followers of santa christ
8474494 i will no longer mutilate and destroy myself in order to find a secret behind the ruins
8474495 im still a little crazy all the time but i can try and hide it
8474496 jobs are leaving the u s industries are being shuttered across the country and we will only be able to win the economic battles when we reform health care
8474497 the past is the past you cant take it back you cant change it
8474498 but what you can affect is today tomorrow and the week after that
8474499 i tell them we really have to get on with it
8474500 and i really think that in time before the election a majority of those people will come around
8474501 if a democrat is going to be elected president there are four or five states that youve really got to focus on
8474502 my advice to the obama campaign for what its worth is to get the candidate joe biden surrogates anybody into those states go to the big towns the little towns the neighborhoods and talk about issues thats what people care about
8474503 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8474504 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment
8474505 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8474506 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry
8474507 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8474508 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8474509 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8474510 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8474511 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8474512 i want you to recognize that this jar represents your life
8474513 the golf balls are the important things god family children health friends and favorite passions things that if everything else was lost and only they remained your life would still be full
8474514 the pebbles are the other things that matter like your job house and car
8474515 there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls the same goes for life
8474516 if you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff you will never have room for the things that are important to you
8474517 so pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness play with your children take time to get medical checkups take your partner out to dinner play another 18 holes
8474518 there will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal
8474519 take care of the golf balls first the things that really matter set your priorities the rest is just sand
8474520 im glad you asked it just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem theres always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend
8474521 i felt the whole team was sharper and physically we were much better than on saturday afternoon

8474537 los republicanos me dec an que era muy joven y muy inexperto para ser el comandante en jefe les suena familiar no les funcion en 1992 y no les funcionar ahora porque barack obama est en el lado correcto de la historia

8474540 y lo que es m s importante barack obama sabe que ee uu no puede ser fuerte afuera a menos que sea fuerte dentro el mundo deber a estar m s impresionado por el poder de nuestro ejemplo que por el ejemplo de nuestro poder
8474541 nothin is as good as they say it is nothin and i do somethin bad pretty good

8474546 cause its like a well trained institution over there once theyre born why do you think they make it to the little league world series every year
8474547 if i marry a girl that punches hard or throws a ball hard will my son genetically be able to throw 95mph cause i can throw about 75 80mph
8474548 euge i dont think you want a wife that punches hard she might punch you hard in the face if you came home late one night

8474551 you dumb mother f amp ker you dont know your left from your right
8474552 i doubt you really went to um let me see that ring again i dont think you really played football there
8474553 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8474554 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8474555 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8474556 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8474557 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8474558 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8474559 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8474560 the journey will be difficult the road will be long
8474561 we were glad to see that assemblywoman angelini and assemblyman rible share our and the publics outrage over the practice of schools paying for and granting raises based on diplomas from unaccredited institutions
8474562 our bills were very similar so instead of drafting legislation separately we agreed wed all sponsor the bill
8474563 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8474564 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8474565 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8474566 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8474567 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8474568 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8474569 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8474570 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8474571 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8474572 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8474573 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8474574 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8474575 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8474576 that was as clear a message as you could get as to why barack obama should be president
8474577 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8474578 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8474579 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8474580 the most obvious the most capable and the most progressive choice for leader is not in the race at least not yet for a long time peter kormos has been demonstrating by example what leadership is
8474581 peters candidacy and victory would promote serious discussion of socialist solutions for the problems faced by working people and the poor including the urgent need to save the environment from the ravages of capitalist greed
8474582 ser un poco m s barato que el c4 sed n y un poco m s caro que el c3 m s caro
8474583 we found no scientific evidence to support current recommendations that consuming these foods increased the risk of diverticulitis and did not appear to increase the risk of developing diverticulosis or complications related to the disorder
8474584 it is important to note that the study findings may not apply to each person that suffers from diverticulosis there are probably going to be a subset of people who adhere to a more restrictive diet that helps to benefit them and their symptoms to improve
8474585 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8474586 the pbr you know its like lets rock and roll lets get it on and lets ride some rank bulls
8474587 i decided you know what were gonna switch it up a little bit
8474588 ill get on the first two and hell get on the last two and that way were already warmed up and ready to go and theres no time to really stop and rest you just get on and go
8474589 we didnt know the bull far out but i had heard that hes a pretty good bull if you could get out on him
8474590 i didnt know he was quite as bad as what he was in the chute but
8474591 i like the idea of having a teammate and cheering each other on
8474592 the one thing i dont like is the winner take all i think every rider should have the chance at some money whether they win or not
8474593 expose your own playmate tricks and win house bunny merchandise
8474594 ive never seen a time when washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up
8474595 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8474596 champ when you get knocked down get up get up
8474597 afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded
8474598 its only gonna make it better when he gets here
8474599 you play the game you play by the rules and there is no way in anything that you can get out of it
8474600 hey i have an idea lets make a restaurant that looks like a nyc version of a farmhouse
8474601 cool ill go to the flea market and get some old tools for the wall
8474602 amish comes to the city and brings all the tricks from the farm
8474603 the acres a farmer sets aside from his regular crop for planting whatever he fancies
8474604 i frequent this place for lunch every chance i get
8474605 issue my beautiful young and talented friend breaks up with her middle aged pot bellied boyfriend her birthday is on valentines day and
8474606 she just brightened your day she had a smile that lit up a room she would talk and be friends with everybody because she loved everybody
8474607 she got caught up in the wrong society make them tell you what theyre doing and if they dont push them i went to everybody to get help because i knew this was coming and the organizations out there need to pay attention to moms because we do know our kids
8474608 i dont recognise my team i already raised the alarm last week but i cant do it every weekend
8474609 we need wins to move up the table and to give us confidence
8474610 were absolutely convinced that we have the right man for the job and that were heading in the right direction we have absolute patience
8474611 im not worked up all im completely calm we drew ten times last year and we ended up champions by ten points
8474612 i am happy because we have played two games and won two games but it is difficult
8474613 we now have a big derby on sunday and all the teams are very good
8474614 hopefully weve got all the injuries at the start of the season and we can get everyone back fit more or less after the international break
8474615 in a way its fallen nicely for us having only two league games in the first four or five weeks of the season when weve got a few injuries
8474616 now how in the world did i get here how did everything in my life culminate to this present situation
8474617 it is too deep we dont know what else to do
8474618 it doesnt matter what the phillies and mets do were just concentrating on just getting wins
8474619 my location was good and i kept the pitches down in the zone
8474620 in my head i was thinking just finish strong and i ended up throwing a good game
8474621 i got lucky he gave me one i could put a good swing on and it felt good
8474622 usually those guys have so much savvy out there they feast on your aggressiveness and youth
8474623 were going through a bad time right now but i certainly dont buy that were not any good
8474624 were just having trouble manufacturing runs the first three runs were home runs but we cant seem to sustain any kind of momentum or rally
8474625 i would say liz did enough to stay out of the big inning he pitched around some walks
8474626 i thought this time his changeup was the real key because they were sitting on his fastball
8474627 we have to win as many games as we can no matter how minnesota plays
8474628 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse

8474642 it was such a long time ago that i might even not remember but i was lost franticly lost in a spiral of up and downs no matter what i did i couldnt stay happy ever i was just completely lost in the world and didnt understand myself i became a shadow of my friend followed everywhere the kid went and then one day we had to go our separate ways so i was a shadow without a base to start from there are many other kinds of loneliness and different feelings or emotions one has when theyre lost and thats what brought us all here almost every room is filled with lost people without a purpose or those who were bored of their life
8474643 she would find us hell i dont understand it and dont think i ever will somehow she just drew us all in one at a time years after one another she would take us she could have knocked us out or seduced us or anything but we dont usually remember how we get here but we do know that she does things to us makes our bodies reflect who our mind is hiding inside if you were really a dog in a human body she would turn you into a dog as i am shadow like now i wasnt always she can manipulate life and the body and she loves hearing us scream thats the one mistake everyone makes letting her hear you scream and pleading her to kill you it only makes her happier
8474644 dont close your eyes if you want to be able to see

8474649 it was a really tough one and i am completely out of breath
8474650 i struggled out there and my opponent played really really well and pushed me to the limit
8474651 i am not yet at my full potential i still have a long way to go to be where i want to be

8474673 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and jill biden and beau biden and mama biden and the whole biden family with me on this journey to take america back
8474674 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier
8474675 they require a wise leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8474676 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8474677 be there for my dad like he was for me be there for barack obama because our country needs him be there because barack and obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8474678 at the start of this campaign we had a very simple idea which is change in america doesnt start from the top down it starts from the bottom up that change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things
8474679 so we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come and join in the party and join in the effort to take america back i think we are going to have a great night tomorrow night and i look forward to seeing you there
8474680 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent

8474684 bloody their nose so you can walk down the street the next day
8474685 afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded or should we trust barack obama who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to afghanistan

8474688 i collected the annual peanuts books all through childhood and its probably impossible to overstate the influence peanuts had on me
8474689 the most important thing i learned from peanuts is that a comic strip can have an emotional edge to it and that it can talk about big issues of life in a sensitive and perceptive way
8474690 marine debris takes a heavy toll on the environment wildlife and even the local economy
8474691 we hope everyone who enjoys the beachs splendor takes their environmental duty seriously and joins us in this great event
8474692 the twice yearly beach clean ups provide a special focused day for folks to come to the coast and help pick up the flotsam and jetsam from other folks and the sea
8474693 the most interesting thing in the past 25 years is seeing the changes in what you find out there
8474694 years ago it was empty cans of chewing tobacco floating out of the surf changing to plastic water bottles thats probably the largest volume of items found on the beaches i scour
8474695 from little tractor trucks to sand pails and plastic shovels shoes and all varieties but never in pairs occasionally dot the beach
8474696 some locals make fun of visitors by calling these items whale snot
8474697 it looks like a boat might have dumped a load of future poles offshore
8474698 many locals have been dragging them off the beach and cutting them up
8474699 at a time when less and less picnic debris is being left on the beach there are more and more rolled up disposable diapers
8474700 not exactly the best examples to be setting by parents with young children
8474701 along with great food and a big crowd one of the employees hid a written wedding proposal and ring in a bottle that he managed to have his girlfriend find while they were gathering trash
8474702 of course along with taking my rake and bucket to collect rocks and fossils throughout the year theres always a handful of solv bags for picking up when items appear
8474703 while the twice annual beach clean up is great and hundreds of tons of stuff gets hauled off its always nice to be doing that ongoing landscape maintenance of the beach
8474704 hes out of control i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love

8474708 they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8474709 while the increase in the number of children with disability attending school is encouraging more has to be done to close the significant gap in employment between people with disability and people without disability

8474712 we would not have performed these tests if we didnt think there was something there
8474713 the operation is over we killed third militant early today thursday
8474714 because they wimps do not interact with electromagnetism they cannot be seen directly
8474715 as more and more wimps thermalize inside the sun they begin to annihilate with each other forming a variety of particles including high energy neutrinos 1 these neutrinos may then travel to the earth to be detected in one of the many neutrino telescopes such as the super kamiokande detector in japan
8474716 businesses that dont insure their employees dont do it because they dont like them
8474717 they do it because they flat out cant afford it
8474718 you push in one side and another side pops out and theres only so many dollars to go around
8474719 if we simply provide coverage without changing what we pay for itll be a disaster
8474720 i think what it comes down to is everybody is going to have to make some sacrifices
8474721 we cannot afford not to go there because health care affects everything
8474722 i feel vindicated i feel great that i am back
8474723 this really goes against the grain of the other economic indicators that weve seen i need to get to the bottom of it
8474724 many seniors are leaving the workforce so their incomes are not as great as they used to be and we have people retiring to vermont they may have assets but not a lot of income so that may well be an explanation because we are the second oldest state now
8474725 i told you come to the shitty of chicago our citizens would elect
8474726 after the georgian leadership lost their marbles as they say all the problems got worse and a military conflict erupted
8474727 and i believe we should handle other existing conflicts in this context
8474728 take it from me obama is okay we can trust this guy you can support him for the same reasons that you supported me
8474729 experience without judgment isnt worth much john mccain proves that with his unwavering support for the policies of george bush
8474730 bill clinton was the new kid on the block when he ran for president but with his priorities in order he set the nation back on the right track so will barack obama
8474731 i wish i could fast forward this boston series and get back on the mound in cleveland theres just no other way to put it i was just flat out awful and hopefully i can put this behind me soon it will be a long night
8474732 my breaking stuff wasnt there it just wasnt there my changeup was up i was just flat out bad
8474733 the players have a day off once in a while
8474734 we have to play our game above anything else and try to win more ballgames and the rest will take care of itself
8474735 were going to be playing the top contenders from the east division and in the central plus houston has been playing well
8474736 were playing all the teams vying for postseason except for the teams out of the west it starts in earnest against the phillies
8474737 theyre a powerhouse offensively and they have four tough pitchers lined up against us well see which way the wind is blowing that always dictates how games are played at wrigley were going to have our work cut out for us
8474738 try to work quickly get ground balls and let the defense help me out
8474739 were recruited in nepal to work as kitchen staff in hotels and restaurants in amman jordan
8474740 for 15 months mr gurung was held in iraq against his will before kbr and daoud allowed him to return home to nepal
8474741 allege that the illicit trafficking scheme from their recruitment in nepal to their eventual employment in iraq was engineering by kbr and its subcontractor
8474742 so it is premature for us to comment at this time
8474743 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8474744 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything in her power to elect barack obama
8474745 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us

8474750 theyre all the same ill show you politics in america he it is right here
8474751 i think the puppet on the right shares my beliefs
8474752 i think the puppet on the left is more to my liking
8474753 hey wait minute theres one guy holding up both puppets
8474754 y de pronto me percato que se ubic a mi lado el capit n arce quien sin mediar provocaci n alguna comenz a insultarme dici ndome en forma amenazante sube ahora las fotos concha de tu madre maric n desgraciado y otros insultos similares mientras pasaba reiteradamente de un lado a otro roz ndome en forma matonesca
8474755 que los superiores de este capit n deber an estar en conocimiento respecto de estas conductas impropias e investigarlas ya que desprestigian a su instituci n
8474756 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial
8474757 presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal
8474758 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial
8474759 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8474760 esta situaci n se alan sucede porque carabineros act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8474761 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche que result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta situaci n desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8474762 emplazamos al general de carabineros de la ix regi n a que informe objetivamente sobre el origen de los balines que afectan a su personal
8474763 muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche
8474764 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches
8474765 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos
8474766 ante el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios
8474767 labors only rationale for this tax increase is to increase revenue and supposedly fight inflation yet even labor senators concede it will be inflationary in their majority report
8474768 labor says they want to look after australias car industry yet they are proposing a tax increase which will damage it labor says they want safer greener cars yet they are proposing a tax which will discourage innovation in these areas
8474769 labor says this is a tax on the rich yet the highest selling so called luxury car is the toyota landcruiser which retails for around 70 000 and is driven primarily by those in rural and regional australia and those with the need for a people mover
8474770 eating just about anything in the range of 300 to 400 calories would be better than nothing at all
8474771 if it took the lives of our military and our civilians to get the western world to the thinking they are now arriving at wed consider the losses justified
8474772 we have paid a very high price for this understanding among western partners but we also believe this price will be rewarded
8474773 i think maybe europe made an honest mistake and miscalculated the danger posed by russia to europe and to the free world
8474774 after this very transparent move i think there is a much bigger awareness
8474775 georgia will never forgive russia for what they have done
8474776 now hes a symbol of anti russia resistance in the post soviet space he defended the interests of his small country
8474777 eventually russia will be forced to leave and those states will be a part of sovereign georgia
8474778 once georgia is a part of europe that will happen
8474779 georgia is a country which does not fit the russian vision of a good neighbor and so this is a lesson also for ukraine
8474780 lets get past the name calling lets get past all this pointless debate about blaming someone here or blaming someone there and lets get on with the business
8474781 our teachers are our greatest resource australia has and what i would say is that we are committed to investing more in quality teaching across australia
8474782 we want a quality revolution in australian schools but were going to be there for the quantity as well which is the additional funds that will be invested
8474783 we believe absolutely from the pit of our stomachs that this is the right thing to do and we intend to prosecute this
8474784 these laws were passed in 2004 and 2008 is the last year that the states actually have the opportunity to comply with the laws
8474785 it is law today that as a condition of school funding states have got to provide plain language report cards to parents and also publish the performance of those schools
8474786 the real challenge for mr rudd is that given 2008 is the last year that the states have to comply will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply
8474787 the one area that we will want to discuss in more depth with the commonwealth is the issue of the so called performance tables or league tables
8474788 this is something weve not supported in the past not because we dont want parents to have more information but because measuring these things is exceedingly difficult
8474789 if it tempts you so much try it in spite of my prohibition but take note i am powerful and i am only the most lowly gatekeeper but from room to room stand gatekeepers each more powerful than the other i cant endure even one glimpse of the third
8474790 i am taking this only so that you do not think you have failed to do anything
8474791 so how is that in these many years no one except me has requested entry
8474792 here no one else can gain entry since this entrance was assigned only to you im going now to close it
8474793 we want to know if it has served stakeholder needs and whether the existing system can be improved
8474794 gen nogovitsyn said poland becomes a target for attack such
8474795 a conduta sexual humana deveria respeitar a seguinte ordem desejo excita o e por ltimo orgasmo mas com a supervaloriza o do orgasmo a maioria pula a fase do desejo e vai direto pra a excita o e a n o tem beijo abra o nem carinho s que eles se esquecem que o beijo um fator essencial para se atingir o orgasmo
8474796 fato que quanto maior a renda e o grau de instru o melhor o desdobramento desse assunto por m o que est em jogo hoje a quest o da falta de tempo e a necessidade emergencial do orgasmo e isso atinge toda e qualquer classe
8474797 o beijo est ligado aos nossos cinco sentidos tato olfato vis o audi o e paladar voc olha nos olhos v a verdade no outro cria um v nculo
8474798 todas disseram que j aceitaram propostas bizarras mas n o aceitam dar beijo na boca muitas delas t m namorado ou tem filho e disseram que nem pagando dariam o beijo
8474799 under any scenario were going to see more nuclear power because its just going to be more cost effective once theres a price on carbon
8474800 the first question is how do you do a tax cut and fight a war which is what george bush did
8474801 my life has been full of disappointments but with them have come positives
8474802 when we were in theatre and he was born i just kept saying to tanz theres our wee boy i couldnt stop crying
8474803 tanz is just so amazing going through what she went through sometimes us males just dont really understand what women go through with pregnancy
8474804 they are both in good health now though so its all good all the staff at jean todd were awesome
8474805 i lost my leg but then i became an international swimmer i have a great partner in tania and im a good looking awesome guy
8474806 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8474807 and what i know is over the centuries the doctrines of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins
8474808 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm anti abortion attitude
8474809 human development begins at fertilization when a male gamete or sperm spermatozoon unites with a female gamete or oocyte ovum to produce a single cell a zygote this highly specialized totipotent cell marked the beginning of each of us as a unique individual
8474810 a lot of my baby pictures of me and my family you would find them and they would be melted and smeared
8474811 i would write him daily and he would write me daily
8474812 our routines are different our recreation is different our friends are different our neighborhood is different
8474813 im in dire straits i dont know where im getting my next meal
8474814 that soon after the storm there were few places to eat
8474815 it didnt matter how much food we bought it sold out every day
8474816 everything is going to be new and its going to be wonderful
8474817 in the next five years this is going to be a boomtown
8474818 weve been put back together again people just did outstanding things for us
8474819 if were talking about drinking and driving dropping the age is a bad idea
8474820 if were talking about decreasing the alcohol consumed per occasion were less certain
8474821 if the training was there and the weapon was in the right holster it wouldve never have happened
8474822 while it may not have changed this outcome as a result of this incident we are evaluating our use of level i security holsters
8474823 also today palmetto health agreed to create a separate waiting area for our inmates
8474824 while no policy can protect against every possibility we will continue to review our policies and procedures

8474833 should we trust john mccains judgment when he rejected talking with iran and then asked what is there to talk about or barack obama who said we must talk and make it clear to iran that its conduct must change now after seven years of denial even the bush administration recognizes that we should talk to iran because thats the best way to advance our security again john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8474834 we must provide iran the time it needs to obtain nuclear weapons
8474835 should we trust winston churchills judgment when he rejected talking with nazi germany and then asked what is there to talk about or neville chamberlain who said we must talk and make it clear to nazi germany that its conduct must change now after seven years of denial even the chamberlain administration recognizes that we should talk to hitler because thats the best way to advance our security again winston churchill was wrong neville chamberlain was right
8474836 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take this country
8474837 in 2004 we came so close to victory we are even closer now and let me tell you this time were going to win
8474838 george bush with john mccain at his side promised to spread freedom but delivered the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time they misread the threat and mislead the country
8474839 i think he would have been an incredible president and i think the country lost out
8474840 when barack obama promised to honor the best traditions of both parties and talk to our enemies john mccain scoffed george bush called it the soft comfort of appeasement but today bushs diplomats are doing exactly what obama said talking with iran
8474841 i dont like the image of barack obama and john kerry to me they represent a weaker america
8474842 no one can question barack obamas patriotism like all of us he was taught what it means to be an american by his family his grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line in world war ii his grandfather who marched in pattons army and his great uncle who enlisted in the army right out of high school at the height of the war
8474843 i have known and been friends with john mccain for almost 22 years
8474844 be there for my dad and be there for barack obama
8474845 no longer will you hear the eight most dreaded word in the english language the vice presidents office is on the phone
8474846 he made the lives of the people on the south side of chicago the work of his life thats what you do when youve been raised by a single mom
8474847 yet the americans are more open to military action especially if a diplomatic solution fails to become a reality
8474848 as a single parent he decided to be there to put us to bed to be there when we woke up from a bad dream to make us breakfast so hed travel to and from washington four hours a day
8474849 so even though dad worked in washington hes never been part of washington
8474850 he always sounded like the kid from scranton penn that he is
8474851 ive never seen a time when washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up
8474852 like many of us barack worked his way up his is a great american story
8474853 i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear
8474854 we have the power to change it thats barack obama and thats what he will do for this country
8474855 unless the state of texas violates their own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot
8474856 we are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation when we miss deadlines we get no second chances this is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy
8474857 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable
8474858 therefore republicans and democrats should be held to the same standards

8474860 while the result from our global renewables division is disappointing it reaffirms our previously stated strategy to restructure this part of our business
8474861 we are currently seeking a strategic partner for global renewables and discussions are underway with several interested parties both in australia and the united kingdom
8474862 we are on track for a conclusion of this process by year end
8474863 the foundation for this result has been progress on both the tenke fungurume project in the democratic republic of congo and the lancashire waste project in the united kingdom while the company is also beginning to establish a niche in western australias growing magnetite iron ore sector
8474864 we also have a very strong pipeline of work with 15 secured definitive feasibility studies this compares with six at the same time last year
8474865 the brisbane team is building up a strong study book with companies such as rio tinto and recently won their first project contract on panaust limiteds phu kham copper gold operation in laos
8474866 the santiago office is gaining momentum and recently secured the study for the angostura gold project in colombia one of a growing number of opportunities in the highly prospective andean region

8474868 an issue of particular frustration is that while the technical performance at eastern creek has been positive and despite ongoing discussions with waste providers we are not receiving fair market revenue for the waste being processed
8474869 it is clear that the ur 3r process is an internationally recognised advanced waste treatment solution that provides a major climate change benefit when compared with landfill
8474870 a global set of high quality accounting standards would be an international language of disclosure transparency and comparability
8474871 it is clear that china has put the bar very high
8474872 that means that no white elephant has been built and the after games use of these venues will be optimal
8474873 these venues will be used by the students of the universities by the owners of the different venues the workers unions this is i believe a great legacy
8474874 the efforts on water cleaning and water remediation will be stepped up more trees will be planted all of this i believe is a legacy of the olympic games
8474875 the regulations might not be perfect and we acknowledge that they are not perfect but they are a sea change compared to the situation before we hope and we have expressed this hope that they would continue
8474876 but we acknowledge at the same time that the situation is a major change
8474877 through the games china has been scrutinised by the world its opened up to the world
8474878 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world and i believe that this is something that will have positive effects on the long term
8474879 the banks are up and the resources are leading the charge

8474889 we categorically deny that the sudan liberation movement has carried out the hijacking we condemn any act that causes harm to any sudanese civilian
8474890 obviously we want to ensure a strong future for the viper but as we focus on the core business well listen to people who have expressed interest
8474891 the market has changed significantly competition within that premium luxury category only intensifies and as a result it really puts something like the viper at a competitive disadvantage from the standpoint that its obviously a very niche focus with limited scale
8474892 guns n roses representatives have been made aware of the arrests and are leaving the matter to the authorities

8474911 its fairly obvious the aircraft went in close to vertical it was a very hard impact
8474912 at the moment weve got most of the wreckage but there are a few bits that have been found in the vicinity where the aircraft collided
8474913 if anyone finds any bits around their houses or on the ground if they could call the atsb on 1800 020 616
8474914 we want to find the bits but more importantly we want to find out where those bits landed because then we can reconstruct from the point of impact backwards which is up in the air

8475059 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8475060 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8475061 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8475062 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8475063 i think the applause to bill clintons speech and the other speeches just took the program overtime hell speak tomorrow im sure the applause for clinton was like 10 15 minutes and i think he probably went longer than alloted

8475065 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8475066 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8475067 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8475068 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8475069 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

8475080 please help me in welcoming my friend my father my hero the next vice president of the united states of america
8475081 i am proud to live in a country with the bravest soldiers in the world
8475082 yes yes i accept your nomination to run and serve with barack obama as the next vice president of america

8475086 breaking news obama to make surprise appearance on stage with biden after speech
8475087 from our end we had a couple of media calls yesterday and in the interest of transparency and honesty we tracked down the information and made it available
8475088 it changed my life people there showed an interest and a want to help muslim americans
8475089 the goal is to demystify these fields and provide tools to be effective speakers strong leaders and confident organizers in their own communities
8475090 if theyre able to clear up misconceptions which they can do through the media and through government the word will get out that mainstream muslims are not like the radical muslims that americans hear about
8475091 frankly if we dont get involved in making laws we dont have a right to protest
8475092 there are some muslim people who would say it is anti islamic to do this or do that just as there are a lot of christians and jews who say it is wrong to do this and do that
8475093 extremists and authoritarians are in every faith and people who are progressive and who believe in love and inclusion are in every faith
8475094 muslims like all other followers of faith groups are not monolithic
8475095 they will have different levels of practice and have different interpretations of religious teachings
8475096 it shows its not impossible for a muslim american to rise up to public office and represent the people
8475097 the title is of great concern to us since the word is commonly used in a derogatory manner against people of the muslim faith or arab origin we have no desire to inhibit the creative process or your right to produce any film you wish
8475098 it is unfortunate that a major film studio would choose to exploit an ethnic slur as a sensational promotion for a movie
8475099 mainstreaming a bigoted term in this manner will only serve to legitimize and normalize anti muslim prejudice in our society

8475119 so here are five words that i would suggest are usually meaningless in a world where the populations were talking about are
8475120 the thing about popcorn is that it is a low investment low risk snack you can eat it if youre not hungry you can successfully have a tiny portion you are virtually certain that it will taste very much like your last popcorn snack there are products that are as easy to sample as popcorn and making your product more popcorn like is a great idea at the same time its interesting to note that very few people make a lot of money from popcorn for a product this ubiquitous its surprisingly unsuccessful coke and nike and marlboro are a lot more powerful than jiffy pop so the second lesson is that you want to make the sampling popcorn like but the commitment to be far bigger than it is for popcorn easy trial and consistent quality can lead to low commitment not a great combination how do we make this more like popcorn how do we make it less like popcorn
8475121 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8475122 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8475123 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8475124 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8475125 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8475126 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8475127 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8475128 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8475129 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8475130 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8475131 who are open to doing something on the production side
8475132 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8475133 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8475134 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8475135 some guys will make it or break it in that game but for the most part you know your team right now
8475136 thats just part of football its all about competition and thats what makes it great because its hard to make the team
8475137 ive seen plenty of people come in here that played well and got cut and ive seen people who didnt play well make the team so you really cant gauge whats going to happen
8475138 income poverty and health insurance coverage in the united states 2007
8475139 five consecutive days of college football to start the 2008 season
8475140 im expecting him to do some great things this year rice said
8475141 hes been very productive and he has a big frame he said of the 6 foot 219 pound morgan
8475142 i think it would be a great opportunity for me too
8475143 culture history and pageantry of football at historically black colleges according to organizers
8475144 i want the fans to come out and support it because its going to be the experience of a lifetime
8475145 everyone in the country knows you just got fired osullivan said
8475146 thats what happens you get fired its embarrassing thats how i look at it
8475147 were not farther ahead but were closer to the finish line
8475148 we came in a little flat after tuesday night carlos stepped up huge
8475149 we did it to them after they did it to us
8475150 the way we lost last night you never know where thats going to lead you
8475151 we stayed close we stayed close stayed close and we had a couple of hits and then murphy had a big hit
8475152 you play against these guys you just got to keep it close its a big win for us bounced back from a loss so were all happy
8475153 we are trying to win them all its not you win one oh we come back and beat you it kind of just worked out that way from last nights game we bounced back and i thought we played an excellent game
8475154 the way you win really doesnt matter but the way we won elevates our confidence and thats good
8475155 we were not expecting that their website be in braille or that they make any huge changes just that they designed the site in a standard way so our software would work
8475156 lots of other large corporation websites have dealt with this successfully
8475157 they did not want to talk to us about it
8475158 in 2006 many things on the website were accessible to visually impaired people and some were not
8475159 whats important is that we have been working continuously as the website and the technology have improved
8475160 target has made a positive shift to dealing with the problem
8475161 i do know that 25 000 marines in a province again are probably in excess of the need especially after iraqi provincial control assumes responsibilities for security
8475162 the taliban are growing bolder in their tactics and clearly doing their best to exploit security gaps where they exist
8475163 weve seen families slaughtered weve seen policemen rounded up and executed with shots to the back of the head in the soccer stadium just to make the point and so thats what we risk if we dont somehow take advantage of those gains and maintain the momentum in that area
8475164 tell me do you think we have time to stop for a coffee
8475165 well only stop to get coffee if you get something to eat too
8475166 why do you still keep that thing didnt you say it was broken
8475167 no no i dont think i was talking about this one this is the one my mother gave me remember
8475168 yes i remember but i also remember you telling me that it was broken and that you hated it
8475169 i do hate it i hate silver but it was my mothers she had it since forever im not going to throw it out and no i never said that it was broken you must have dreamt it again
8475170 teaches your kids responsibility because theyve been taking care of the cows since may and to see their excitement when they do well and it all pays off in the end
8475171 its a lot of work and then getting to see friends that i havent seen in a while
8475172 good feelings just to give a little bit of yourself
8475173 we dont always know their names but we recognize their faces
8475174 weve lowered the prices youve got to do what youve go to do but you have to keep the gates open too
8475175 the weather looks beautiful as far as temperatures are concerned i never turn down a little shower it cleans the streets and fields
8475176 gnome do do is an intelligent launcher tool that makes performing common tasks on your computer simple and efficient
8475177 this was a huge huge win for us simply because of the way we lost last night
8475178 we couldve afforded to lose but the way we lost last night you never know where thats going to lead you
8475179 you always want to see the big league team do well
8475180 it was a team effort its not about one guy or one pitcher we did a great job
8475181 were fighting some demons the demons of the past the rascals that have hung around us for a year
8475182 every time we lose a game like last night is a reminder of that
8475183 i think the race will come down to the end
8475184 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8475185 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8475186 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8475187 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8475188 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8475189 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8475190 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8475191 i never write the yankees off until the seasons over and the standings are set
8475192 theyve been around too long and been in the playoffs for such a long time that were definitely not counting them out
8475193 it couldnt have been any worse the first two games but weve got to come back tomorrow
8475194 when i walked into this clubhouse i remembered getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away and i got a smile on my face because it just has a good memory to me
8475195 and i know this is the last year of the stadium so you think about that
8475196 two games doesnt make a lifetime it doesnt make a career
8475197 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankee series for me
8475198 im not writing a hall of fame career just yet but its been nice to get off to the start ive gotten off to it takes a little bit of pressure off
8475199 hes a beauty hes kind of i think the energizer bunny for this team
8475200 you know hes the one that stirs stuff up every team has got to have that guy
8475201 the seasons getting shorter we dont have many games left
8475202 we really have to come out and be perfect tomorrow
8475203 hey my spidey sense tells me youre about to pull off some caper thats not going to be so good for us
8475204 office hours only if your idea of fun is sparring with linden pets who are the only thing worse than some of the lindens truly in fact thats probably why they keep those loathsome sycophants around as it makes the lindens look like paragons of thoughtfulness and rational deliberation
8475205 they are going to keep looking past the customers they have now to the ones they wish they had whether corporate or educational or government so look past them too
8475206 whoever or whatever sl is for it definitely isnt for us that much ive learned its in spite of us and for someone else
8475207 ll kind of reminds me of the type of people who really dont connect with other people at a party because they keep looking over their shoulders waiting for the really important people to arrive
8475208 we will be introducing the new blog and forum enhancements in october until then the blog will continue to be utilized for announcements other information is also being made available in other parts of the website such as the grid status page blog margins and showcase
8475209 i never write the yankees off until the seasons over and the standings are set
8475210 theyve been around too long and been in the playoffs for such a long time that were definitely not counting them out
8475211 it couldnt have been any worse the first two games but weve got to come back tomorrow
8475212 when i walked into this clubhouse i remembered getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away and i got a smile on my face because it just has a good memory to me

8475217 hes a beauty hes kind of i think the energizer bunny for this team
8475218 you know hes the one that stirs stuff up every team has got to have that guy
8475219 the seasons getting shorter we dont have many games left
8475220 we really have to come out and be perfect tomorrow
8475221 he was a loving man and he worked very hard for the community
8475222 the really stupid thing is that he was the type of person that if these people just asked for it he wouldve given them whatever they wanted
8475223 he was a good muslim man he cared a lot about the community
8475224 he was a good father to me and good husband to my mother
8475225 iraqs oil fields are a vital source of wealth and revenue to their country and must be kept in tact for future prosperity of the iraqi people
8475226 they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights
8475227 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8475228 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8475229 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8475230 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8475231 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8475232 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8475233 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8475234 the government is busy basking in the benefits of this policy while leaving the environment to pick up the tab
8475235 been astute enough to pick up what might be a current hole in the resource efficiency capability of not only victoria but also the nation
8475236 encouragement to deal with a whole of life issue concerning products that may ultimately end up within the waste stream
8475237 i am happy to look at local based regulation and market mechanisms but also harmonisation with other jurisdictions across the nation to try to make sure we have the appropriate investment and regulatory environment whether that be most appropriate in state or national jurisdictions
8475238 clearly more focused on collecting accolades than the environmental issues associated with their policy
8475239 in the next decade victoria will be faced with tens of thousands of dead hybrid car batteries with no environmentally sustainable way of disposing of them
8475240 i want victoria to lead the way nationally in developing a clear framework for identifying when and what products require recycling at the end of their use including car batteries and the most appropriate market or regulatory approach to achieve that
8475241 specialises in the recovery of nickel and cadmium to a strict environmental standard
8475242 the judgment was it was a good opportunity to visit australia and to discuss what is being considered in terms of the future policy arrangements applying to the industry and the perspective of a key participant
8475243 the belief that we can go further and eliminate coal from our energy supply is a dangerous delusion
8475244 that process is in line with the procedures established by the previous government on the consideration of visa applicants he said
8475245 mr broadus has not been granted a visa there are further steps required beyond character assessment before a visa is granted
8475246 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus
8475247 community complaints have no effect on the grant or otherwise of a visa
8475248 as a result of public concern and interest the department has decided that in fact we will be undertaking a more thorough assessment of mr broadus character
8475249 however the decision on the granting or refusal of a visa application is made on the individual merit of the case consistent with the legal criteria for the class of the visa
8475250 vanessa should have been walking out of that hospital totally healthy
8475251 change the system that killed my daughter to make it a safe system thats the apology i want from reba meagher
8475252 im shocked with the extent of these deaths given the government has denied them is not reporting them is failing to come clean with the extent of problems in our hospitals
8475253 there may be a bit of argy bargy on the way through but i think its time to do this
8475254 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8475255 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8475256 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8475257 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind

8475275 declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8475276 these bans on plastic bags are wrong for the environment wrong for business and wrong for consumers
8475277 the obvious result of a plastic bag ban is an increase in the use of alternative bags such as paper bags
8475278 many grocery and retail stores in maui and hawaii already offer at store programs that allow consumers to bring their used plastic bags back for recycling
8475279 more americans are recycling plastic bags and film than ever before driven by a growing realization that plastic bags and film are too valuable to waste
8475280 we look forward to shining light on the environmental and economic implications of the councils action in the days weeks and months ahead
8475281 thats yet another step in the development of our credit offering
8475282 we are an unquestionable leader in the polish market in terms of the number and value of credit card transactions our efforts are aimed at making it easier for our customers to use citibank credit cards also while internet shopping
8475283 a true measure of the popularity of our credit cards is the fact that in the first quarter of 2008 citi handlowy acquired 60 000 new citibank credit card clients as a result the number of citibank credit cards issued by the bank in poland exceeded 866 000
8475284 another solution making online shopping easy is offered by unikasa as part of a joint project with ecard previously customers of e shops paid for their purchases at the post office as of march 2007 they have been able to do it at the checkout counter in supermarkets to benefit from this option all they have to do is to choose unikasa as a method of payment when placing their order at an e shop and then print out an automatically generated confirmation with a barcode on it when doing shopping in a store that belongs to the unikasa network they can pay for the item purchased on the internet in cash within three working days the money is credited to the account of the e merchant who sends the goods thats a perfect solution for customers who often pay for their purchases in cash and do not have a credit card
8475285 an additional benefit is the fact that the e merchant applies a lower delivery charge
8475286 the winner must present a good balance of capability cost and risk and be able to provide danish industry with a viable and competitive long term partnership
8475287 we believe the super hornet is the best value option and offers a winning solution for denmarks fighter requirements
8475288 the super hornet has been a model acquisition program for the united states and the u s navy one that has continued to add capability while decreasing cost over its lifetime
8475289 the super hornet with its small logistics footprint and high mission readiness rates will stand well in the competition since it enhances effective deployment in international operations with the aesa radar now fully onboard the two seat f a 18f is providing unmatched aircrew situational awareness and taking air combat capabilities to new levels as we can now seamlessly execute same time air and ground missions this is truly an aircraft that delivers tomorrows capabilities today
8475290 no other drug eluting stent has this level of clinical data support in the setting of primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction
8475291 more than 3 000 patients have been included in nine randomized trials to assess the safety and efficacy of the cypher select plus stent in ami all of these studies have demonstrated significant reductions in the occurrence of repeat revascularization at one year with no increase in stent thrombosis death or repeat myocardial infarction long term follow up has also demonstrated that these results are sustained
8475292 we are confident of achieving a global peak sales potential of more than eur 100 million annually with this active ingredient
8475293 we wanted to transition to a digital system in order to create new opportunities of optimization reduce technical and operational risks and provide our viewers with consistently exceptional video and audio quality and to support our operational growth plans over the next 10 years
8475294 because we are working with remote sites different compression schemes formats and applications it was essential to find a system that would provide transparent integration operational flexibility quick and accurate monitoring and easy and efficient control we knew we needed to work with a supplier with a proven commitment to interoperability among technologies and individual components and harris has fully demonstrated that commitment

8475302 i have a very young daughter id like to see her grow up and see grandchildren this is where i get emotional so just bear with me
8475303 what we have done is to teach the body how to cure this disorder
8475304 i could literally give up everything other than my family to have a cure
8475305 every single cell in the lettuce leaf contains 10 000 copies of this insulin gene
8475306 it is the same insulin that is injected but here what we are doing is instead of injecting it in the blood system we are presenting it to the immune cells and then asking the immune cells to see that this is your own protein
8475307 what we have done is to teach the body how to cure this disorder this is a totally new concept a new platform to use this oral delivery system to fix this immune disorder
8475308 you dont need to inject this so all of these expenses which are associated with human therapeutic delivery are eliminated using this
8475309 we are anticipating the same result as we found in the animal model
8475310 the makeup of the guys in this clubhouse is that they can have a 10 game losing streak and put it all behind them
8475311 you cant come off a 4 2 road trip and get swept at home thats not a good thing
8475312 i thought fausto got better as the game wore on
8475313 i felt the best that i have all year tonight i had good stuff
8475314 its funny i had nothing in kansas city in my last start and won and tonight i lost
8475315 im pleased with the way their guys fought through things with all the adversity and trades and things
8475316 i dont really think about the record going into the games
8475317 i just try to remember what ive done to them in games past and how i got different guys out stick with the game plan and execute it until they try to do something else
8475318 you know hes going to pitch a good game and put up a lot of zeros
8475319 hes one of the premier pitchers in the league so i knew i couldnt make a mistake
8475320 roy and two big swings are all we needed tonight
8475321 i dont know if it was the first inning going a bunch of pitches right out of the chute
8475322 i kind of ran down a little bit i thought maybe i could get through the eighth but that was pushing it
8475323 maybe in new york i went out of the zone for some fastballs
8475324 but i feel just as good as i did the prior week
8475325 give him 10 more of them and he wont drop them
8475326 salty didnt take it for granted the ball was going to be caught it worked out well for us
8475327 thats what were taught since little league to hustle and run the ball out thats the fundamentals of baseball we were in a tight situation we needed a big hit i thought when he hit it that i had to run as hard as i can especially since im not in the lineup everyday i busted my fanny as hard as i could rounding third i saw him drop it and i thought they might throw me out at home then i saw catcher miguel olivo out there too and i knew i had it
8475328 obviously the error hurt but it shouldnt have been as close as it was either
8475329 a lot of that has to do with lack of run production when we should produce third inning runner on second nobody out and we dont get him over fourth inning runners on second and third with nobody out and we dont score a run out of that too
8475330 it should have been caught and you dont get a lot of practice at it it should have stuck in the glove and it didnt its kind of unexpected
8475331 this was a huge huge win for us simply because of the way we lost last night
8475332 we couldve afforded to lose but the way we lost last night you never know where thats going to lead you
8475333 you always want to see the big league team do well
8475334 it was a team effort its not about one guy or one pitcher we did a great job
8475335 were fighting some demons the demons of the past the rascals that have hung around us for a year

8475339 theyve been around too long and been in the playoffs for such a long time that were definitely not counting them out

8475347 you know hes the one that stirs stuff up every team has got to have that guy
8475348 the seasons getting shorter we dont have many games left
8475349 we really have to come out and be perfect tomorrow
8475350 sure we could be farther behind but we could be ahead
8475351 it doesnt feel good to go out there and lose
8475352 especially when we know were better and were capable of doing a lot of good things
8475353 ive been bitten by the home run in the second half
8475354 i dont know what it is a lot of them have been the solo variety it gives our team a chance to stay in the game
8475355 you play this game long enough and you know teams are going to hit skids like this its just part of the game but its still frustrating to go through it
8475356 we have to worry about whats going on here if we take care of our business the standings will come out if we keep winning were not worried about the diamondbacks just like theyre probably not worried about us
8475357 mated as for the concerns is that these payments are seen whereas bribes

8475367 the damn leadoff hitter needs to step up and do something
8475368 we dont need to worry about anything arizona is doing if we take care of our job
8475369 i still think he has the ability to help us
8475370 i feel like im one of the main reasons our offense isnt going
8475371 which i was unaware he had as was dolls guitarist sylvain sylvain whom i just spoke to in london i believe arthur didnt know either about two weeks ago he came down with what seemed to be a lingering flu for which he was under doctors care last night he went to the hospital where he died
8475372 i will always remember the look of bashful happiness on arthurs face as people in the audience constantly called out his name he was finally back where he belonged
8475373 its good to know that he went out on a high point in his musical life
8475374 which i was unaware he had as was dolls guitarist sylvain sylvain whom i just spoke to in london i believe arthur didnt know either about two weeks ago he came down with what seemed to be a lingering flu for which he was under doctors care last night he went to the hospital where he died

8475380 prema t ure especially when their support is needed for a 25 million chariho bond on the ballot this november the bond money is slated to bring charihos richmond campus up to code and elim inate the need for having classes in trailers
8475381 hopkinton has never been supportive of the dis trict mageau said noting hopkinton voters last november refused to pass a bond question to repair the schools
8475382 the people of hopkinton must be educated about how lucky they are to have two other towns share the cost of educating their children said andy polouski vice chairman of the chariho school committee who spoke when the workshop was opened up for public comment
8475383 i hope the people of hopkinton are smart enough to stand up and not destroy the most valuable asset they have
8475384 i would like to see chariho remain strong how ever i have very little faith in its ability to do so she said
8475385 lack of loyalty and trust on the part of the other four members
8475386 the people of hopkinton must be educated about how lucky they are to have two other towns share the cost of educating their children
8475387 the people of hopkinton must be tricked and coerced into voting for the bond with the other two towns so the lucky one charlsetown will not have to bear the cost of leaving the district
8475388 the current was not sufficient to the transistor it was not enough to trigger the blast
8475389 we are still to examine why explosives were placed at such place
8475390 as much as consumers seem to be slowing down at the moment i think theres still lot of investment in capacity
8475391 the rba has seen a consumer demand slowdown and relied on business investment holding up
8475392 but anything beyond that depends on data to come after christmas
8475393 first and foremost this makes it less likely well have a negative print for gdp next week
8475394 it the capital spending numbers was strong across the board and that was the reason to buy the aussie dollar and sell bonds
8475395 i also think there will be a gradual easing cycle of rate cuts rather than an aggressive easing cycle
8475396 the banks are up and the resources are leading the charge

8475404 maybe we got duped a little bit maybe we overestimated her
8475405 the public policy favoring resolution of cases on their merits is not promoted by permitting a party to a single such matter to impose an undue burden on judicial resources to the detriment of all other litigants
8475406 nor is the efficient disposition of the business before the courts advanced by undermining the authority of the trial court to supervise the parties who appear before it
8475407 in declar ing a judicial plague on the houses of these contentious montagues and capulets
8475408 not only denies all parties a trial on the merits
8475409 results in a waste of the time energy and resources of the parties
8475410 substantial judicial resources that have been devoted to this case
8475411 proactive efforts to provide a firm discovery schedule and progressive warnings and sanctions
8475412 i have to tell you folks that i have reached my limit never has that happened to me yet in eight years as a judge
8475413 what seems to me is that the parties in this case are less interested in litigating legal issues than they are in a tit for tat that has more to do with personal issues
8475414 parties willful contumacious defiance of court orders via excessive frivolous and retaliatory motion practice
8475415 not by any means an instance of willful contumacious or bad faith conduct

8475426 de dichter wordt aan het begin van de uitzending dus om 10 30 u ge ntroduceerd luistert vervolgens naar wat er voorbij komt en maakt naar aanleiding daarvan een gedicht rap lightverse al naar gelang de specialiteit van de dichter van die dag het resultaat draagt hij zij direct na het nieuws van 11 30 u live voor
8475427 we verwachten van de dichters dat zij zich daarvan bewust zijn en ermee rekening houden er wordt echter vooraf uiteraard geen censuur toegepast
8475428 we kunnen vooralsnog geen financi le vergoeding aanbieden voor het dichterlijke werk mogelijk dat daarvoor enige ruimte ontstaat als zich na verloop van tijd een vaste groep van meewerkende dichters vormt
8475429 i just wanted to come by got something to say i want everybody to know and understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and jill biden and beau biden and mama biden and the whole biden family with me on this journey to take america back
8475430 i think this conventions gone pretty well dont you think
8475431 i think michelle obama did pretty well opening night dont you think
8475432 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8475433 no need for spell check that is the way obama talks missing the uh um duhs though
8475434 and this is what god says to all humanity the fear of the lord is true wisdom to forsake evil is real understanding
8475435 those were the days when i went to the city gate and took my place among the honored leaders the young stepped aside when they saw me and even the aged rose in respect at my coming the princes stood in silence and put their hands over their mouths the highest officials of the city stood quietly holding their tongues in respect
8475436 but thanks be to god who made us his captives and leads us along in christs triumphal procession now wherever we go he uses us to tell others about the lord and to spread the good news like a sweet perfume our lives are a fragrance presented by christ to god but this fragrance is perceived differently by those being saved and by those perishing to those who are perishing we are a fearful smell of death and doom but to those who are being saved we are a life giving perfume
8475437 as the deer pants for streams of water so i long for you o god
8475438 just as the rich rule the poor so the borrower is servant to the lender
8475439 but thanks be to god who always leads us in triumphal procession in christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him
8475440 here paul takes an image from the roman world seeing jesus as the victorious conquering general in a triumph parade
8475441 for we are to god the aroma of christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing
8475442 fragrance in the form of incense was common at the roman triumph parade in pauls mind this fragrance is like the knowledge of god which people can smell when the triumph parade winds by
8475443 to the victors the perfume from the censers would be the perfume of joy and triumph and life but to the wretched captives who walked so short a distance ahead it was the perfume of death standing for a past defeat and their coming execution
8475444 in the same way the message of the gospel is a message of life to some and a message of condemnation to those who reject it john 3 17 21
8475445 the same happens to the present day to those who receive and to those who reject the gospel it is the means of salvation to the former it is the means of destruction to the latter for they are not only not saved because they do not believe the gospel but they are condemned because they reject it
8475446 we do not peddle the word of god for profit
8475447 it may describe something which can bear the test of being held up to the light of the sun and looked at with the sun shining through it
8475448 who has helped you utter these words and whose spirit spoke from your mouth
8475449 turn my heart toward your statutes and not toward selfish gain
8475450 better a poor man whose walk is blameless than a fool whose lips are perverse
8475451 the only way to live a successful christian life is to come under the authority of god to be in obedience to him
8475452 so i ask you are you living in obedience to god have you accepted gods authority to the extent that you are willing to give up our way and take gods way to give up your will and take gods will
8475453 even jesus had to say not my will but thine be done
8475454 can we understand that jesus the man had to learn obedience to god exactly as you and i do the writer of hebrews spoke of his learning obedience i mean having to learn it like i have to learn it like you have to learn it
8475455 eventually jesus had to face the thing that god wanted him to do he didnt want to go to the cross he didnt want nails driven into his hands can you imagine how that would hurt imagine having the flesh and bones of your hands crunched by nails being driven through them and then having nails driven through your feet
8475456 thats the law of god thats the law of nature so jesus had to give he had to obey god the human part of him didnt want to do it any more than we do but jesus is our example in giving up our own way and taking gods way we too can say not my will but gods be done and how glorious it is when we go through it endure the pain of it and come out with a resurrection with a seed multiplied with the joy of the lord flowing in our hearts
8475457 for to me to live is christ and to die is gain
8475458 all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me david thought that every trouble in the world had met in him but he exaggerated for all the breaking waves of jehovah have passed over none but the lord jesus there are griefs to which he makes his children strangers for his loves sake sorrow naturally states its case forcibly the mercy is that the lord after all hath not dealt with us according to our fears yet what a plight to be in
8475459 yet the lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime come what may there shall be a certain secret something to sweeten all lovingkindness is a noble life belt i e life jacket in a rough sea the day may darken into a strange and untimely midnight but the love of god ordained of old to be the portion of the elect shall be by sovereign decree meted out to them no day shall ever dawn on an heir of grace and find him altogether forsaken of his lord the lord reigneth and as a sovereign he will with authority command mercy to be reserved for his chosen and in the night both divisions of the day shall be illuminated with special love and no stress of trial shall prevent it
8475460 majesty i had a special moment with the lord as i listened to this song
8475461 i have a responsible grown up life but peel back the trousers and i am a hot blooded undieboi

8475483 your local department of health should be interested in this information a they served adulterated food b when advised of adulterated food they did not require the diner to surrender the dish for replacement the diner had to request this obvious action c when requested by the diner the dish was not replaced any establishment that will lie and reserve a contaminated dish will likely commit other health violations

8475490 our contractor didnt want to drain the pool completely when kids are still using it so he was able to set it up so the kids could swim while construction was going on they were working 24 hours a day on the project
8475491 the perfect end state would be that the project becomes self sufficient it doesnt require any american influence to be able to continue
8475492 i dont lose anything if i cut a share from my profits and give it here for my country

8475496 the only thing that can destroy us is us we shouldnt do it to ourselves and we shouldnt use fear for political purposes scaring people to death so they will vote for you or scaring people to death so that we create a terror industrial complex
8475497 egypt shows us how easily human nature bends towards using power to preserve privilege at the expense of the weak
8475498 part of a larger system a complex web of power and violence and industry and technology that exploits people for its expansion and profit
8475499 and it happens in the wilderness which has global implications because the sinai event happened in the wilderness and not in the midst of a nation or city or province where someone could make ownership claims it was for all the people of the world
8475500 theyre commanded do not mistreat or oppress a foreigner for you were foreigners in egypt do not take advantage of a widow or an orphan do not deny justice to your poor people it is as if god is saying the thing that has happened to you go make it happen for others god measures their faith by how they treat the widows orphans strangers the weak among them gods desire is that they would bring exodus to the weak in the same way that god brought them exodus in their weakness
8475501 because of the lords eternal love for israel he has made you king to maintain justice and righteousness
8475502 the bible is full of stories in which the pagan characters seem to have better insight into the ways of god than the people who are supposed to have that insight see jethro in exodus 18 rahab in joshua 2 the magi in the gospels and numbers 22 were not sure about balaams donkey
8475503 god doesnt have a problem with eating and drinking and owning things its when those things come at the expense of others having their basic needs when the passionate rants of the prophets really kick in
8475504 take away the comforts of kingdom deprive a person of the structures and institutions of empire and they just might find the spine to envision a new tomorrow push a person to the limits of suffering and they just might become a revolutionary
8475505 in that day israel will be the third along with egypt and assyria a blessing on the earth the lord almighty will bless them saying blessed be egypt my people assyria my handiwork and israel my inheritance
8475506 for the prophets in exile no vision was too large no dream too big no hope too beyond what would happen in the new exodus a movement bigger than any one nation bigger than any one ethnic group bigger than one religion
8475507 what started as a promise of hope for a particular group of people beside a particular river turned into a universal hope for all of humanity whatever river they find themselves beside
8475508 for the fellow traveler jesus death isnt the end of hope its actually the beginning of hope
8475509 if evil always takes some form of violence then more violence isnt going to solve anything
8475510 paul is gathering with the religious leaders trying to persuade them about jesus he doesnt first go to the gentiles he goes to the religious faithful he attends their gatherings he speaks to them in their language paul does this because he knows that if the church gets converted the whole world will follow
8475511 due to this inhuman behavior america will fail she will fail completely among the countries and another nation will rise and take americas place america will lose because her behavior is not the behavior of a great nation
8475512 those who live by the sword shall die by it
8475513 an entirely different understanding of what just took place in jerusalem to himself an understanding that strikes at the core of their entire worldview which looked for the military restoration of israel and in the process of explaining to them what really just happened namely the fulfillment of gods plan see lk 24 he reaches out to save them from perpetuating the very thing he came to save them from
8475514 you forget the people god cares about the widow the orphan and the refugee
8475515 entitlement leads to becoming immune to the suffering of others because i got what i deserve and so apparently did they in the empire of entitlement when the fundamental awareness is lost that this is all a gift luxuries can begin to seem like necessities excess can become normal and it can be very easy to lose perspective on just how much we have
8475516 if you are a citizen of an empire that has the most powerful army in the history of humanity and is currently on the way to spending a trillion dollars on a war passages in the bible about those who accumulate chariots and horses from egypt are passages about you and your people
8475517 this is a warning to us of the powerful impulse within an empire to tell only one version of the story the version that glosses over the dark side and injustices in order to serve the larger story of continued supremacy and success
8475518 imagine how dangerous it would be if there were christians who skipped over the first century meaning of johns letter i e revelation and focused only on whatever it might be saying about future events years and years away there is always the chance that in missing the point they may in the process be participating in and supporting and funding various kinds of systems that the letter warns against participating in supporting and funding that would be tragic that wouldnt be what jesus had in mind that would be anti jesus that would be anti christ were the people in johns church reading his letter for the first time with roman soldiers right outside their door thinking this is going to be really helpful for people two thousand years from now who dont want to get left behind
8475519 for someone to receive someone has to give for someone to be fed someone has to provide the food if someone somewhere benefits then someone somewhere has paid something
8475520 a church is not a center for religious goods and services where people pay a fee and receive a product in return a church is not an organization that surveys its demographic to find out what the market is demanding at this particular moment and then adjusts its strategy to meet that consumer need
8475521 this is why when christians organize politically and start flexing their muscle making threats about how they are going to impose their way on others so many people turn away from jesus jesus followers at that point are claiming to be the voice of god but they are speaking the language of caesar and using the methods of rome and for millions of us it has the stench of solomon its not the path of descent
8475522 the eucharist is about people with the power empowering the powerless to make a better life for themselves
8475523 the church is the living breathing life giving system confronting empire subverting picture of the new humanity
8475524 jesus wants to save our church from the exile of irrelevance if we have any resources any power any voice any influence any energy we must convert them into blessing for those who have no power no voice no influence

8475538 personally im always ready to learn although i dont always like being taught
8475539 theres nothing worse to hit than a public school in my opinion
8475540 you hit a public school like that that says to me that the person doesnt really care much about the community
8475541 the budget for schools is already not what it should be or not enough to provide those for all the kids in all the schools
8475542 because they wimps do not interact with electromagnetism they cannot be seen directly
8475543 as more and more wimps thermalize inside the sun they begin to annihilate with each other forming a variety of particles including high energy neutrinos 1 these neutrinos may then travel to the earth to be detected in one of the many neutrino telescopes such as the super kamiokande detector in japan

8475595 the time of parental care has ended and it is time for action according to indications of the market
8475596 women who participated in the study say they like south korean men whom they find considerate compared to their northern counterparts
8475597 but north korean men say they are often appalled by women here who speak out and act according to their own will
8475598 southern women are not very womanlike north korean women are calm and keep things to themselves in a graceful way but women here like to speak their mind and act like men
8475599 in the north a man always leads a relationship and he takes total control because of the patriarchal culture
8475600 male students i meet here are mostly considerate men in the north try to make women feel inferior
8475601 not as committed to relationships as they are open to sex the difference is that north korean men take responsibility for what they do
8475602 we need to have an independent inquiry an independent group to verify the amount of water thats there
8475603 then well know once and for all and politicians will be able to act and find some of that water and send it down
8475604 an inquiry thats very genuine with wide terms of reference that they can look at the on farm storages the illegal dams and levy banks that have been built any discussion or any progress so far on sequestering water down into the aquifers looking at all the pumps that are pumping water out it has to be a very extensive inquiry
8475605 at the moment high security water is the only water that does have a percentage of allocation next to it
8475606 the house a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged
8475607 two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead two dogs which we believe were in a kennel block are missing
8475608 a search will be carried out of the property to establish if anybody was inside as soon as the building is deemed to be safe
8475609 i have never seen them in the local pub or walking the dogs or the horses
8475610 i would have a very different opinion of tivo if its primary goal was to sell set top boxes
8475611 if that was their strategy id be quite negative but the company has been shifting its business strategy and we think theres enough runway left for them to start penetrating cable operators
8475612 i think the view is now with or without tivo people are going to watch television very differently and were focused on creating the right tools and the right business model so as these consumption changes occur there is a way for the industry to adopt to this and we avoid the issues that the newspaper industry now finds itself going through or the music business has gone through thats going to take a lot of work because while we see the industry beginning to understand that the speed with which this is attacked has an awful lot to do with the ability of the video business to avoid major dislocation

8475617 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8475618 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8475619 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8475620 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8475621 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8475622 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8475623 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8475624 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8475625 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8475626 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win

8475770 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine
8475771 i decided i didnt want this guy anywhere near a trigger
8475772 if john mccain gets the nomination its going to destroy the republican party its going to change it forever be the end of it
8475773 he is a vicious person nearly all the republican senators endorsed bush because they knew mccain from serving with him in the senate they so disliked him that they wouldnt support him they have been on the hard end of his behavior
8475774 john was very rough in the sandbox everybody has a mccain story if you work in the senate for a while you have a mccain story he hasnt built up a lot of goodwill
8475775 there would be a lot of people who would have to recalibrate their attitudes toward john
8475776 for all his supposed newfound enlightenment about what most americans want protection against invasion commitment to the rule of law meaningful employer sanctions an end to sanctuary cities enforcement by attrition plus deportation reform and an end to special illegal alien benefits that invite more law breaking the maverick remains a geraldo rivera republican like the ethnocentric cable tv host who cant string a sentence about immigration together without drowning in emotional demagoguery mccain naturally resorts to open borders platitudes when pressed for enforcement specifics mccain has learned nothing
8475777 his temper would place this country at risk in international affairs and the world perhaps in danger in my mind that should disqualify him
8475778 i heard about his temper more from others according to them he really unleashed on some of them and they couldnt figure out why it happened enough that it was affecting his credibility with some people
8475779 what happens if he gets angry in crisis in the presidency its difficult enough to be a negotiator but its almost impossible when youre the type of guy whos so angry at anybody who doesnt do what he wants its the presidents job to negotiate and stay calm i just dont see that he has that quality
8475780 no dissent no opinion to the contrary however reasonable will be entertained hardheaded is one way to say it arrogant is another way to say it hubristic is another way to say it too proud for his own good is another way to say it its a quality about him that disturbs me
8475781 he is the anti conservative he instinctively sides against conservatives and relishes poking them in the eye
8475782 it just seems like everything we did john was someplace else in my mind he is not a conservative
8475783 i think its his style as much as much as the positions he takes i think its his attitude that its his way or the highway
8475784 i dont like mccain i dont like him at all
8475785 has a legendary temper and often uses foul and obscene language
8475786 what has struck me about mccain is that everybody underestimated the ability of his advisers and him to hypnotize the national media because most of us in the media in arizona thought of him as a guy who had a terrible temper occasionally had a foul mouth a guy who whined and pouted unless he got his way mccain has a temper that is bombastic volatile and purple faced sometimes he gets out of control do you want somebody sitting in the white house with that kind of temper
8475787 john mccain is bob dole minus the charm conservatism and youth
8475788 ill help you get elected if you will appoint me to

8475790 its a great opportunity to add even more people cause in the past they have had problems seating everyone so adding more people to the stadium is pretty incredible

8475792 instead of us being on defense on social wedge issues weve got to put him on defense about peoples checkbooks
8475793 i saw many specialists about my health over two and a half years
8475794 i had mris magnetic resonance imaging done but the doctors found nothing wrong with my heart there was a time when i thought i was dying as i was so weak that i lost control of my bladder and bowel movements and i developed a great fear of death
8475795 it was so bad that in those early years i had to take 16 pills per day for my condition
8475796 the psychological problems masked my menopausal symptoms as the overriding concern was managing my mental health at that time i had frightening hallucinations and there came a point when i almost gave up on my life
8475797 i dont think i would have survived without the loving support of my husband and children and some very dear friends
8475798 in retrospect my neurosis was triggered during my perimenopause which lasted about 10 years
8475799 for the past two years i didnt have my period except for some spotting recently however i am still managing my neurosis
8475800 there was once when the bleeding was so bad that i wet the bed the next morning i could not get up as i felt extremely weak
8475801 so i was not afraid about the huge blood clots and the amount of blood i was losing
8475802 last december the blood clots and flow were particularly heavy i went to see my gynaecologist who did a procedure similar to a d amp c dilation and curettage to flush out the clots
8475803 after the procedure i had regular periods for three months
8475804 my gynae tells me that my perimenopause is likely to continue for the next four to six years
8475805 my mothers perimenopause was so bad that once we had to carry her as she was too weak to get up by herself
8475806 i learnt about my hot flushes and mood swings from health magazines my symptoms were quite mild and though i may have two periods in one month they were diminishing flows and spotting i probably hit menopause in december 2003
8475807 i had gone for my usual medical check up and the result showed a cyst in my womb though it was a non cancerous growth the gynae recommended a hysterectomy
8475808 i went to two other specialists and they too agreed with the first gynae i had my uterus and ovaries removed in december 2002 and have been on hormone replacement therapy since

8475813 i was just trying not to pass out from the anxiety tonight
8475814 we had a horrible week of practice i think i was putting too much pressure on them wanting them to go out and get the first score get the first big hit tonight i just told them not to worry about it just go out and have fun
8475815 i think our senior leadership is what made the difference tonight im very proud of the boys
8475816 i want to give a lot of credit to the assistant coaches
8475817 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight i promise you that
8475818 last night we were successful in making sure the american people knew where senator obama was coming from and throughout the rest of it were going to make sure that folks know exactly what the choice is between obama and mccain

8475821 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8475822 yup i was coming home from a long days work
8475823 my thesis in a nutshell is that though the reformers had paul on their side in decrying merit before conversion and rightly emphasized that god freely imputes christs righteousness to a believing sinner apart from prior moral efforts nevertheless they were wrong to exclude evangelical obedience as the puritans called deeds produced by divine grace in the lives of the redeemed from having a secondary role in the way of salvation which we tread thereafter paul and james alike point to good works as the pathway to gods approval at the last judgment and they consider this future moment an integral part of justification itself for persons to be justified in the full sense gods present imputation of righteousness to those who are incorporate in christ by faith must be legitimized in the end by his approbation of an actual righteousness which he brings about in them during the meantime while faith is the ultimate condition for both events deeds are proximately conditional in their own right for the culminating event my understanding of the grammar and of the implied metaphysics of scripture requires me to engage sharply with the reformers over the issue of how christian obedience relates to justification in eschatalogical perspective sola fide is true when it describes how we first enter into a new standing with god but it oversimplifies the nature of the christian journey into the coming age with potentially disastrous effects
8475824 a fresh look at the doctrine of sola fide is needed for at least three further reasons its method violates the rule of the scriptural canon in substance stress on faith alone severs justification too cleanly from sanctification and with regard to its effects in history the doctrine is dangerous since the 1520s it has proven powerless to check repeated outbreaks of antinomianism opposition to the teaching of moral law in churches indebted to the reformation resulting in large fringes of congregants today imbued with the heresy that without mortifying sins they can nevertheless rest assured of reaching heaven

8475847 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8475848 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8475849 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8475850 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8475851 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8475852 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8475853 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop

8475855 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8475856 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8475857 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8475858 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8475859 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

8475883 i note the comments on the newcastle website the contents of which disappoint me because james milner was left with no option in his opinion but to formally ask for a transfer following the clubs total refusal to offer him a new contract
8475884 the contract which was signed a year ago was agreed more than 11 months before that when they refused to let his transfer to aston villa go through on deadline day in august 2006 a new deal was agreed in principle and it took until the following july to be established
8475885 in that time james has played two seasons in newcastles first team and he was asking for a salary figure that reflects that james feels that his salary does not reflect his value in the market
8475886 he was simply asking for an improvement that reflects his development
8475887 having played over 50 games last season and 160 games in the premier league he believed his improvement warranted a new contract
8475888 it was made clear on two occasions there was not going to be a new contract therefore he felt that he was left with no option

8475892 women who participated in the study say they like south korean men whom they find considerate compared to their northern counterparts
8475893 but north korean men say they are often appalled by women here who speak out and act according to their own will
8475894 southern women are not very womanlike north korean women are calm and keep things to themselves in a graceful way but women here like to speak their mind and act like men
8475895 in the north a man always leads a relationship and he takes total control because of the patriarchal culture
8475896 male students i meet here are mostly considerate men in the north try to make women feel inferior
8475897 not as committed to relationships as they are open to sex the difference is that north korean men take responsibility for what they do

8475953 on est venu le chercher cela fait plusieurs ann es quil vit pratiquement en reclus il a d j eu des probl mes avec des jeunes du quartier donc il refuse de sortir son seul loisir cest le v lo et la course pied
8475954 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8475955 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8475956 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8475957 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8475958 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8475959 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8475960 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8475961 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8475962 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8475963 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8475964 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8475965 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8475966 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8475967 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8475968 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8475969 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8475970 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8475971 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8475972 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8475973 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8475974 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8475975 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8475976 whats happened at the very top of the first round is ridiculous when youre paying the guys who have never one anything more than star football players in this league that have played for years and established themselves at this level what theyre capable of it can be a little frustrating
8475977 this was a long and challenging process for the player and for the team this was a good example of the problem commissioner goodell has cited with the lack of a rookie pay scale were all happy that derrick can now focus on getting on the field being a jaguar and contributing to the team
8475978 oh im sorry you had to take one of those
8475979 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8475980 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8475981 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8475982 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8475983 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8475984 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8475985 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8475986 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8475987 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8475988 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8475989 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8475990 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8475991 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8475992 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8475993 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8475994 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8475995 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8475996 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8475997 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8475998 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8475999 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8476000 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8476001 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8476002 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8476003 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8476004 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8476005 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8476006 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8476007 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8476008 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8476009 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8476010 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8476011 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8476012 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8476013 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8476014 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8476015 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8476016 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8476017 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8476018 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8476019 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8476020 we are pleased to present another quarter of record revenues and year over year record revenue growth
8476021 ninety eight percent net income growth on a non gaap basis in the first half of 2008 and 101 growth in net cash generated from operating activities in the same period represent the continuous improvement of our core business attributed both to the merger transactions with microsystem and gibbs as well as to continuous organic growth cimatrons global distribution network is broadening its product offering with gibbscam solutions and already recorded initial gibbscam sales we face a challenging currency environment and are continuously monitoring and dealing with its effects on our financial results

8476026 im zweiten quartal verloren die deutschen tageszeitungen 2 2 prozent der auflage gegen ber 2007
8476027 die auflage seit jahren stur um 2 5 prozent zur ck
8476028 nun ja eine beschreibung die auch auf jeden blog passen k nnte ausgew hlt wird schlie lich auch da und auch nicht nur die verlobte von boris becker ganz im gegenteil solche klatschgeschichten kommen dort ganz im gegensatz zu den etablierten medien eher selten vor
8476029 nie waren handwerklich und ethisch gut ausgebildete journalisten notwendiger als heute um das berleben des qualit tsjournalismus in der digitalen welt zu sichern
8476030 enth lt wenig was neu oder berpr fbar w re
8476031 drohen die medien zum surrealen kettenbrief digitaler illusionen und t uschungen zu werden wo die fakten durch meinungen und die professionellen nachrichtensammeler von durchgeknallten kommentatoren ersetzt werden
8476032 i dont address questions that relate to vice president issues
8476033 i just wanted to get on the bus with him spend some time with him offer whatever advice i could
8476034 a leader of the new generation of the republican party
8476035 maybe mccains not sure that pawlentys ready on day one if hes saying hes an impressive young man
8476036 he has within him i think the qualifications to do it
8476037 truly helps mccain in his weakest area and that is the economy
8476038 the biggest problem obama has today is whether or not he can pull in the hillary clinton vote
8476039 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8476040 rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world
8476041 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8476042 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
8476043 the campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8476044 he has shown a clear grasp of our foreign policy and national security challenges
8476045 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 and it will not work in 2008
8476046 to testify that barack obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8476047 after weeks of moaning and groaning about how angry he is about how mad he is at obama he made the strongest case for obama of anyone at this convention
8476048 he thinks he did a great job he wants to get his due from the guy whos succeeding him
8476049 reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8476050 sacking principals turning over staff closing schools that churning and instability that will occur in that process is not going to help students and may in fact damage communities
8476051 the plans that kevin rudd has put forward simply wont make a systematic or system wide difference to education
8476052 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk democratic peoples republic of korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8476053 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8476054 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8476055 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8476056 this sudden move was not entirely unexpectable as the us has irked north korea by delaying the removal of north korea from the list of terrorism sponsoring states and south korea and the us did the joint military drill which was seen as a threat to the north
8476057 i do not believe that north korea whole heartedly said they will go back to the starting point in terms of denuclearization process i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the us to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
8476058 de all nos vamos al campo ayacucho en la faja petrol fera del orinoco luego visitaremos sidor y el s bado en la ma ana hace su programa de radio y tv

8476060 el presidente correa desea conocer la magnitud de la planta que nos va a proveer el acero para nuestra industria
8476061 overall the treasury announcement is a sensible response to a constructive period of consultation but it is disappointing that progress has been so slow
8476062 we will make up for that in part through new tax revenues from higher earners
8476063 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 men and 15 women
8476064 this matter is of grave concern to the united nations we have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
8476065 el ejecutivo nacional crear un punto de interconexi n o punto de acceso a la red de proveedores de servicios de internet con la finalidad de manejar el tr fico con origen y destino en el espacio geogr fico de la rep blica
8476066 la preocupaci n es sobre los mecanismos de control de contenidos que pueda aplicar el gobierno si s lo se tiene un solo punto de interconexi n
8476067 qu garant a hay de que no exista un control de la sociedad y que este punto de acceso a la red no va afectar el acceso a determinado tipo de informaciones
8476068 tiene que demostrar el estado la necesidad de hacer esa reserva sobre los medios radioel ctricos y las telecomunicaciones
8476069 lo que hay es una extensi n de las atribuciones del ejecutivo y sin ning n tipo de control institucional son decisiones unilaterales
8476070 son el tel fono en la oficina de un importante hombre de negocios del pa s para comunicarle que se postergaba por tiempo indefinido el cierre de una inversi n por cuatro millones de d lares que se efectuar a en san pedro sula
8476071 en mi vida hab a recibido tantas llamadas del extranjero y de tantas personas sumamente preocupadas por la direcci n que est tomando el pa s
8476072 inversionistas de estados unidos me han dicho que van a frenar sus expansiones en el pa s hemos tratado de decirles que todo sigue normal pero una cosa es lo que podemos decir los hondure os tratando de convencerlos y otra son las declaraciones que la gente recoge de los que dirigen el pa s en este momento
8476073 no tenemos las suficientes opciones para darles aqu trabajo a todos esos compatriotas as que es algo preocupante considero que las autoridades tienen que llamar a la calma y a la reconciliaci n del pueblo hondure o y que trabajemos todos en buscar las soluciones de nuestro pa s sin injerencias de venezuela
8476074 no puedo decir nada en espec fico en cuanto al proceso pero no dudo de que ser muy cre ble primero porque tenemos las autoridades dom sticas en el tribunal supremo electoral tse y est n bien preparadas
8476075 re establish with the members of the various communities the peaceful cohabitation and the harmony that has always been the distinctive mark of the indian society
8476076 the state is a mute spectator to the violence that has been unleashed in the christian community
8476077 very seriously and now they are going to pay them back
8476078 this is nothing but pure political hate propaganda against the christians when the root problem is of course caste oppression
8476079 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8476080 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8476081 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8476082 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything
8476083 twelve houses between them two rich guys its almost like shooting fish in a bucket
8476084 has a history of terror in this hemisphere and its linkages to the bombings in buenos aires are pretty well established
8476085 one of our broader concerns is what iran is doing elsewhere in this hemisphere and what it could do if we were to find ourselves in some kind of confrontation with iran
8476086 le chain avoir le caravane pass the dog may bark but the caravan keeps passing president mugabe ignored the hecklers and continued laying the legislative agenda as if the hecklers were not there
8476087 quiero invitar al se or presidente a que saquemos esa bandera blanca
8476088 quiero invitar a mis colegas del gobierno al se or presidente lvaro uribe a que saquemos esa bandera blanca a que en un momento donde nos acusan de cosas injustas lo aceptemos por la dignidad del cargo
8476089 yo hago un llamado a los partidos para que no piensen en las pr ximas elecciones sino en las pr ximas generaciones
8476090 gt b gt ohioans to obama offer help not just hope
8476091 i believe the message will be help is on the way said state rep
8476092 not just hope help help for real problems every family watching this speech know all too well
8476093 i hope he will and i expect he will drill down into the issues of high credit rates rates exotic mortgage schemes that leave people without homes of jobs going overseas every thing that is weighing on the american people
8476094 its amazing to me when i hear people say that they dont know barack obama that they dont know what he wants to do
8476095 people keep saying he hasnt been specific but if you look at the record i dont know how much more specific he could be i think its the other side that has a problem with specifics
8476096 it will be a unity speech a speech about bringing people together in this country about all of finding common goals and working toward them
8476097 hell tell america that this is a big country a great country with a big vision and that there is nothing we can not do if we do it together
8476098 is to offer a thoughtful prescription which is detailed for every constituent group that he believes he needs to reach
8476099 a business community that is either in opposition to him or anxious about the potential changes an obama administration could bring and those working people who feel that insecurity and anxiety and who are looking for someone to believe in
8476100 i believe the message will be help is on the way said state rep
8476101 not just hope help help for real problems every family watching this speech know all too well
8476102 i hope he will and i expect he will drill down into the issues of high credit rates rates exotic mortgage schemes that leave people without homes of jobs going overseas every thing that is weighing on the american people

8476109 i am happy because we have played two games and won two games but it is difficult
8476110 we now have a big derby on sunday and all the teams are very good
8476111 antes que comecem seus debates com o senador barack obama ele deveria terminar seu debate consigo mesmo
8476112 a estrat gia da cal nia e do medo ficou velha e os americanos v o rejeit la nas elei es
8476113 nosso pa s menos seguro e est mais isolado agora do que em qualquer outro momento na hist ria recente
8476114 se o governo se empenhar para que sua base tenha posi o sobre cada proposta ajuda a avan ar o processo
8476115 continuaremos tendo as dificuldades de sempre j que h diverg ncias de todos os lados
8476116 acho que a c mara e o senado discutirem mat rias desse tipo em conjunto politicamente bom
8476117 mat rias relevantes foram votadas mas n o aprovadas foram o financiamento p blico e a lista pr fixada dentre outras
8476118 n o foram aprovadas naquele momento e agora acho dif cil uma mudan a de posi o de alguns partidos ou de qualquer partido por isso que temos que ver outras mat rias como cl usula de barreira fim das coliga es proporcionais h coisas importantes para serem feitas
8476119 chamei a empregada meu padrasto e meus irm os n o acreditavam quando olhamos s vimos a fralda

8476125 he ran into my knife he ran into my knife 10 times
8476126 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8476127 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8476128 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8476129 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8476130 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8476131 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8476132 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8476133 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8476134 o god if this is how you treat you friends i can see why you have so few of them

8476136 o christ thou lamb of god that takest away the sin of the world have mercy upon us grant us peace
8476137 eso habr a que pregunt rselo al director de obras p blicas nosotros los trabajos de pavimentaci n los hicimos el a o pasado ellos sab an desde 2007 que esa obra ya estaba hecha
8476138 los miembros de la comisi n de adjudicaci n de obra en este caso tambi n participa la regidora celia fausto autorizan todas las obras que se realizan en el municipio si alguien tuviera alguna observaci n en ese momento debieron de haberlo se alado
8476139 as est asentado en las actas y en los diferentes oficios que nosotros enviamos a la direcci n de obras p blicas en esta administraci n no se van a poder terminar las banquetas del centro hist rico por cuestiones presupuestales en dado caso debieron de haber empezado por otras vialidades en donde no hab a una intervenci n previa en las calles y pino su rez hubiera quedado bien hasta dentro de seis a os
8476140 lo desconozco porque ese proyecto lo tiene la direcci n de obras p blicas y nosotros no lo conocemos
8476141 it is going to be a slog to work though this but there is no easy way to do it
8476142 we havent seen the trough of the credit cycle yet
8476143 its exciting to be involved in a local organisation like that im looking forward to getting into it
8476144 its a wonderful tribute to athletes who have worked so hard were all pretty tired but this will lift everybody its a neat finish
8476145 everyone is equal and no one should live for anyone else except themselves
8476146 a search of the address in derbyshire is under way and is expected to take several days
8476147 i think theres a strong argument for saying that more of the training which occurs can be done in regional and country areas where theres less population and where there are valuable job opportunities
8476148 theoretically it should be impossible for two planes to collide so theres obviously been a failure a serious failure somewhere in the system but im advised that training there has been undertaken for many many years with a good safety record
8476149 i think one of the things that we would like to see over time is more of this sort of training undertaken in less densely populated areas and i suspect thats one of the things that may come out of the reports
8476150 its one of the busiest airports in australia i think there are something like 500 000 air movements there each year
8476151 its also im advised one of the safest but obviously we want to ensure that the airports are as safe as possible
8476152 obviously yesterday was a tragic accident and tragic for the family concerned but it could have been worse
8476153 we are grateful for the fact no schools or occupied houses were affected but we will look very closely at the report of the coroner and casa
8476154 we want to look back to where the accident happened to see where the bits flew down
8476155 the reason we are here at the crash site today is to see if there was anything wrong with the aircraft prior to the accident
8476156 the pilot had more than 250 hours experience before he became an instructor
8476157 there are problems and they are mostly to do with accent
8476158 some guys will make it or break it in that game but for the most part you know your team right now
8476159 thats just part of football its all about competition and thats what makes it great because its hard to make the team
8476160 ive seen plenty of people come in here that played well and got cut and ive seen people who didnt play well make the team so you really cant gauge whats going to happen
8476161 the governor believes californians ought to have the opportunity to vote on these four measures on the november ballot despite the fact that the legislature is two months past their deadline in passing a budget
8476162 gods presence is palpable and we sense his generous welcome
8476163 we need musicians poets and artists to create new forms of worship in which we celebrate coming home as a great resurrected community to a world where the broken are made whole justice comes for the poor and shalom to the nations
8476164 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8476165 avete partecipato a questa campagna solo per me o per lamerica

8476185 tutti ormai in occidente si pongono il problema di mettersi nei panni della russia
8476186 la ragione di stato ci ha reso complici nel dimenticare la cecenia

8476200 grazie al loro impegno alla dedizione dei giovani ed alla certezza delle posizioni tenute dal partito
8476201 che lunione di centro ha potuto riscuoter consensi senza rimaner schiacciata fra le due grandi coalizioni elettorali pdl lega e pd idv mantenendo quindi una significativa rappresentanza parlamentare la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori siamo consci che nel periodo in cui viviamo i veti pregiudiziali e lostruzionismo allazione di governo siano deleteri per un paese che cerca di risollevarsi testimonianza ne la presenza in aula dei nostri parlamentari a garanzia del numero legale per un corretto svolgimento dei lavori di contro votar a scatola chiusa i disegni di legge presentati significherebbe allinearsi su posizioni che non ci appartengono e sulle quali nutriamo forti perplessit

8476203 avremmo sparato a obama da grande distanza circa 750 metri usando un fucile
8476204 barack una persona come tutte le altre ha ripetuto pi volte michelle nelle interviste pre convention viene dalla classe media e riuscito a fare il college solo grazie alle borse di studio i suoi problemi sono quelli di tutti i genitori americani vuole un avvenire migliore per le nostre figlie
8476205 un uomo integro capace di trascinare lamerica e di restituire speranza
8476206 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8476207 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8476208 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno

8476210 no longer will you hear the most dreaded eight words in the english language the vice presidents office is on the phone
8476211 when i got knocked down by kids bigger than me
8476212 she told me and this is the gods honest truth bloody their nose
8476213 ive never seen a time when washington has watched so many people knocked down without helping them get back up
8476214 thats the america were gonna get if george if john mccain is elected
8476215 because barack obama made that choice families in illinois have moved for welfare to the dignity of work
8476216 john mccain is my friend a friendship that goes beyond politics
8476217 i profoundly i profoundly disagree with the direction he wants to take this country from afghanistan to iraq
8476218 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8476219 never ever ever give up until we achieve equal pay for women
8476220 the reemergence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front of the war on terrorism
8476221 regrouped in the mountains between afghanistan and pakistan john mccain was wrong and barack obama was right
8476222 again and again and again john mccain has been wrong and barack obama has been right
8476223 people have always been more impressed by the power of our example than the example of our power
8476224 lets shut down guantanamo america does not torture not now not ever
8476225 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8476226 this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8476227 school systems will immediately benefit from our integrated device management capabilities that enable management of assets at the classroom school and district levels
8476228 we are excited to partner with a visionary company like promethean to offer our device management expertise to improve the educational experience and help schools reduce operating costs

8476230 theres a growing shift toward healthy plant based diets especially among people looking to lose weight and keep it off
8476231 theyre made to eat forage and were making them eat grain
8476232 mr banting was a fat man at age sixty five the five foot five banting weighted in at over two hundred pounds
8476233 banting was recently retired had no family history of obesity nor did he consider himself either lazy inactive or given to excessive indulgence at the table
8476234 nonetheless corpulence had crept up on him in his thirties as with many of us today despite his best efforts he took up daily rowing and gained muscular vigor a prodigious appetite and yet more weight
8476235 he cut back on calories which failed to induce weight loss but did leave him exhausted and beset by boils
8476236 luckily for banting he consulted a surgeon who had recently been to paris the doctor had just heard the great physiologist claude bernard lecture on diabetes
8476237 a diet of only meat and dairy would check the secretion of sugar in the urine of a diabetic
8476238 excessive obesity might be allied to diabetes as to its cause and if a purely animal diet were useful in the latter disease a combination of animal food with a vegetable diet that contained neither sugar nor starch might arrest the undue formation of fat
8476239 he ate three meals a day of meat fish or game usually five or six ounces at a meal with one or two stale toast or cooked fruit on the side he had his evening tea with a few more ounces of fruit or stale toast he scrupulously avoided any other food that might contain either sugar or starch in particular bread milk beer sweets and potatoes
8476240 despite a considerable allowance of alcohol in bantings regimen four or five glasses of wine each day a cordial every morning and an evening tumbler of gin whisky or brandy banting dropped thirty five pounds by the following may eight months later and fifty pounds by early the next year
8476241 i have not felt better in health than now for the last twenty six years he wrote
8476242 had entered the english language as a verb meaning to diet
8476243 gouty obese and nervous we strongly recommend him to bant
8476244 did what members of established societies often do when confronted with a radical new concept they attacked both the message and the messenger the lancet like todays newsweek first whined that bantings diet was old news second that his diet could be dangerous
8476245 if only i could make another piece as good as that one
8476246 barack obama and i took very different journeys to this destination but we share a common story
8476247 we learned the dignity of work and we were told that anyone can make it if they just try hard enough that was americas promise for those of us who grew up in middle class neighborhoods like scranton and wilmington
8476248 these are common stories among middle class people whove worked hard their whole life played by the rules on the promise that their tomorrows would be better than their yesterdays that promise is the promise of america
8476249 it defines who we are as a people and now its in jeopardy i know it you know it but john mccain doesnt seem to get it barack obama gets it though
8476250 my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you everyone is your equal and everyone is equal to you
8476251 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8476252 now after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong and barack obama was right
8476253 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abysmal failure
8476254 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8476255 i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8476256 at the start of this campaign we had a very simple idea change in america doesnt start from top down it starts from the bottom up that change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things
8476257 and so we want to open up this convention to make sure that everyone who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back i think we are going to have a great night tomorrow night and i look forward to seeing you there god bless you god bless america
8476258 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8476259 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the unites states
8476260 madame secretary i move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and suspend the further conduct of the roll call vote
8476261 all votes cast by the delegates will be counted and that i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8476262 without a strong democratic majority in the senate his ambitious agenda will be thwarted by the defenders of the status quo whose goals can be boiled down to a single word no
8476263 i thought bill clinton hit a home run today and hillary hit one last night
8476264 bill clinton put his finger exactly on the heart of the matter when he came to office people said he had no experience with the national economy with international affairs and he succeeded beyond his wildest expectations i know barack obama i know bill clinton i worked with both men and i have extraordinary confidence in barack obamas ability
8476265 his speech was brilliant he really talked about the difference between mccain and barack obama
8476266 and he clearly showed why we should all support barack obama if there are any remaining hillary supporters who didnt feel they shouldnt be with barack i think thats all gone away both clintons have made it clear that he represents the future
8476267 i think that he has sound judgment and wisdom and a curious mind i think he knows what hes doing
8476268 hes ready to be commander in chief and hes got a great partner in joe biden so im very happy
8476269 its the first time that unanimous by proclamation by unanimous consent that we have an african american president
8476270 it just cant get better for america thats why were here
8476271 this is a great moment not just for our country but for the world because he is going to be the leader of the free world
8476272 but we need to recognize that thats the case we have to re double our efforts we take nothing for granted
8476273 its really selfish of him to do something like that
8476274 abc news could lose corporate advertisers over this and without advertisement money abc news cant afford to cover important news stories thats why we dont cover important news stories like this
8476275 embarrassing a politician in the act of a money transfer involving a corporate lobbyist
8476276 what if he eslocker had a gun instead of a news camera
8476277 or what if he had a gun shaped like a news camera or worse still what if the politicians inside the hotel werent able to receive their lobbyist money because of this
8476278 persistently low fertility and an increasing number of survivors to higher ages
8476279 we are still on track the process has speeded up and governments are very serious about negotiating a result in copenhagen
8476280 accra has laid the foundation of what could serve as a first negotiating text for a copenhagen deal
8476281 countries have made it very clear that issue of forests need to be part of a copenhagen deal
8476282 thats important because emissions from deforestation account for 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions
8476283 parties were deeply committed and submitted proposals for solutions on the issues
8476284 all in all the group has made good progress its important to take this progress forward in pozna when we return to the issue of the ranges of emissions reductions for developed countries under the kyoto protocol
8476285 one of the cdms shortcomings is that it is not leading to enough investments in africa
8476286 there is a real risk of africa becoming the forgotten continent in the context of the fight against climate change unless we manage to design a regime going into the future that take into account in a much more comprehensive way what africas specific needs are not only on adaptation but also on fuelling clean economic growth
8476287 really the only thing you can choose here is the operating software so you can have a linux based product or windows based
8476288 thats pretty much the only configuration you can choose as opposed to the u s where you can configure everything you want
8476289 linux is highly used in emerging markets and widely accepted
8476290 it allows us to offer a more basic computing and affordable computing platform
8476291 they really were made with the emerging markets in mind and the needs of these small businesses
8476292 the products revolve around those needs affordability access to technology only the software they want basic computing needs
8476293 theres no question that some of our largest tech companies who have been so successful as global competitors are finding that there are new competitors from emerging markets and from even more advanced economies
8476294 the way for them to remain competitive and to keep growing is through designing products that reach out to consumers in emerging markets who have the purchasing power and now the desire to connect to the global economy through the internet and through technology
8476295 the key i think is designing products with the proper price points for consumers in emerging markets so its not a question only of innovation but a question of design and efficiency to reach those hundreds of millions of potential consumers
8476296 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
8476297 i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
8476298 i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
8476299 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
8476300 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama
8476301 i am proud that she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wanted for our chidlren
8476302 i am not so grateful for the chance to speak in the wake of hillarys magnificent speech last night but i ll do the best i can
8476303 like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8476304 the american dream is under siege at home and american leadership in the world has been weakened
8476305 he has shown a clear grasp of foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to rebuild our badly strained military
8476306 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding instincts and insight america will have the national security leadership we will need
8476307 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8476308 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him obama and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8476309 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8476310 the gold coast is a vitally important region for football
8476311 it is one of the fastest growing regions in the country with a population already over half a million and a strong level of participation and interest in the sport
8476312 like the gold coast north queensland people are very proud of their local teams
8476313 lakatos methodology is not a methodology at all but merely
8476314 a blog i would drag kicking and screaming into prominence if i could
8476315 i just come here when i need to shout at my monitor for a while
8476316 one finger on the pulse of the enemy another on the trigger
8476317 a blog i would drag kicking and screaming into prominence if i could
8476318 i just come here when i need to shout at my monitor for a while
8476319 one finger on the pulse of the enemy another on the trigger
8476320 indeed rape it is the consent that is the key what is the act of governing without consent
8476321 think of government as a marriage pepper youve entered into a bond but it does not mean that the right to do certain things are guaranteed a wife who doesnt consent can still be raped as an elected government can still run over its people better to do make sure that permission is asked for each act every time better yet to make the government vanish run by monthly volunteers and automated frameworks for a month youve been chosen to be a judge study hard next year youll be a filing clerk for a month we all serve we all vote were the government
8476322 that craps nice until you have a threat breathing down your your neck
8476323 even the athenians you adore so much turned quickly towards strong leaders when it came time to face invaders our time on chilo is countable in days you will need leaders not town meetings
8476324 it did turn out rather well for the athenians throwing away freedom for a good defense didnt it after centuries under the boot of the satraps i would have thought dying free would beat living safe
8476325 sure we could be farther behind but we could be ahead
8476326 it doesnt feel good to go out there and lose
8476327 especially when we know were better and were capable of doing a lot of good things
8476328 ive been bitten by the home run in the second half
8476329 i dont know what it is a lot of them have been the solo variety it gives our team a chance to stay in the game
8476330 you play this game long enough and you know teams are going to hit skids like this its just part of the game but its still frustrating to go through it
8476331 we have to worry about whats going on here if we take care of our business the standings will come out if we keep winning were not worried about the diamondbacks just like theyre probably not worried about us
8476332 the matter was settled at a major meeting of mccains advisers
8476333 the mccain campaign is hoping to have 15 000 people at the ohio rally roughly five times the size of his largest crowd to date
8476334 sen obama to join sen obama on stage after his acceptance speech
8476335 send a message to the entire internet industry that access for people with disabilities is not only good business sense but an absolutely legal civil right its mandatory
8476336 to improve the experience for guests who require assistive technology
8476337 now that businesses know the courts will pay attention to this if a barrier is brought to their attention it gives them all the more reason to say lets deal with this and accommodate rather than say the law doesnt apply to me im not affected by this
8476338 one of the reasons this case was so risky is that that southwest case came out very badly we were very worried about the fact that the one precedent in the area was very bad
8476339 bellwether case in that it announces loud and clear to those who have web sites that they need to be accessible to everyone
8476340 the cost of making a web site accessible if its done at the beginning is fairly nominal
8476341 and the increase in market share is always going to be greater than the cost
8476342 this has gotten enough publicity that it just makes a lot more sense legally and as a business matter to accept it as an education
8476343 my teachers gave me a tissue to put in my pocket because i chood
8476344 dakine is well established within the boardsports sector and it is a brand that has built its reputation on the quality and reliability of its technical range
8476345 it has built a strong sales base in north america and a growing sales base in several international territories making it a powerful addition to the group
8476346 dakine is a brand that leads the boardsports backpack category excels in the surf accessories market in the ultimate testing ground of hawaii and has excellent penetration in winter product categories including snow gloves
8476347 it is a brand that is focused on function over fashion and this together with a strong team of athletes and compelling marketing campaigns has endeared it to active boardsports participants
8476348 billabong and dakine have both determined that each of us has complementary skills and strengths and together we have a compelling authentic offer
8476349 my redeemer lives i know i just spoke with him this morning
8476350 the best and most beautiful things cannot be seen or touched they must be felt with the heart
8476351 the beauty myth how images of beauty are used against women
8476352 ive heard of prayer boxes before in the church but weve never extended it to the outside
8476353 and how to make it 24 hours 7 days a week
8476354 ive always been of the mindset that ill try anything once
8476355 well thats very person that we need to be praying for
8476356 ive seen the power of several people praying for something and it makes a difference
8476357 its pretty awesome to be able to go back and be able to see the different requests that god has answered
8476358 were just looking forward to seeing how gods going to use it
8476359 good evening mam my name is lt phillips with the tn highway patrol were having a sobriety check point this evening have you had anything to drink
8476360 look for a georgia state trooper on most any road that you travel at any time of the day or night
8476361 were going to be using every resource we have well be using concentrated patrols mini concentrated patrols well be using laser vascar radar well be using road blocks well be cooperating with local agencies surrounding states
8476362 this shows the motoring public that no matter where you go during labor day or any other time that we do work together were all fighting the same goal
8476363 the material was not sourced to bernstein and was used without the firms permission
8476364 the big downfall is that obamas not reaching the undecided voters
8476365 thanks to our millions of online supporters who frequently visit our web site and other social networking sites unlike other campaigns barackobama com already has extremely high organic search engine rankings which helps us limit the number of terms where we need to use paid advertising to have a presence
8476366 he missed a wonderful opportunity to say here is what the other guys are saying about me and here is my point of view
8476367 typically the result of better creative and that is the story here as well
8476368 we cannot continue to afford the schools and growth we have now
8476369 we not only want to give people an alternative but a better entertainment experience
8476370 we wanted to take everything out there about television and push it to the next step
8476371 the company goal is to become the only communication and entertainment company that a home will ever need that includes cable television high speed internet and wireless and local phone service
8476372 they were incredibly close their two characters just got married
8476373 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight
8476374 no one loved her doing it more than mark he was thrilled
8476375 they were devastated so we closed the set immediately as people were trying to come to terms with the tragedy
8476376 his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him
8476377 his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile
8476378 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8476379 volumes will remain thin and investors are likely to stay on the sidelines till a clearer picture emerges on the political front
8476380 sixteen years ago when i was running for president the republicans said i was too inexperienced to be president
8476381 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8476382 bound by the dovish attitude of clinton and his advisors
8476383 you get to know them and you find they really have a great sense of humor
8476384 nous avons un important travail faire ce soir je suis ici pour soutenir barack obama et pour consacrer joe biden que jaime et que lam rique va aimer

8476395 men are more inclined than women to exhibit a range of risk taking behaviours while on the road
8476396 men are more inclined to speed show aggression fall asleep behind the wheel and to identify themselves as impatient
8476397 insurance premiums usually take gender into account for these very reasons
8476398 men are more likely to be involved in an accident due to overconfident or risky driving and women are more likely to have had difficulty judging distances but are generally more courteous on the road
8476399 analysis of historical claims data from aa insurance found that on average women made around 6 per cent more claims than men but their average cost of their claims was lower than men
8476400 there are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statistics
8476401 a relatively high 15 per cent of men admitted they exceeded the speed limit most of the time even if only by a few kilometres per hour compared with only 9 per cent of women
8476402 therefore women have more accidents women are worse drivers than men

8476416 umatku telah dikurniakan dengan lima perkara yang istimewa yang belum pernah diberikan kepada sesiapa pun sebelum mereka bau mulut daripada seorang islam yang berpuasa adalah terlebih harum di sisi allah daripada bau haruman kasturi ikan ikan di lautan memohon istighfar keampunan ke atas mereka sehinggalah mereka berbuka puasa
8476417 masanya telah hampir tiba bilamana hamba hambaku yang taat akan meninggalkan segala halangan halangan yang besar di dunia dan akan mendatangimu pada bulan ini syaitan syaitan yang durjana dirantaikan supaya tidak menggoda mereka ke arah maksiat maksiat yang biasa mereka lakukan pada bulan bulan selain ramadhan pada malam terakhir ramadhan orang orang yang berpuasa ini akan diampunkan
8476418 tidak tetapi selayaknya seorang yang beramal itu diberi balasan setelah menyempurnakan tugasnya
8476419 telah datang kepadamu bulan ramadhan di mana allah melimpah ruahkan di dalamnya dengan keberkatan menurunkan rahmat mengampuni dosa dosa kamu memakbulkan doa doa kamu melihat di atas perlumbaan kamu untuk memperolehi kebaikan yang besar dan berbangga mengenaimu di hadapan malaikat malaikat
8476420 setiap hari siang dan malam pada bulan ramadhan allah tabaraka wa taala membebaskan begitu banyak sekali roh daripada api neraka dan pada setiap orang islam pada setiap hari siang dan malam doanya pasti akan diterima
8476421 terdapat tiga jenis orang yang doa mereka tidak ditolak doa daripada orang yang berpuasa sehinggalah dia berbuka puasa imam penguasa yang adil dan orang yang dizalimi yang kerana doanya itu allah mengangkatnya melepasi awan dan membuka untuknya pintu pintu langit dan allah berfirman
8476422 sesungguhnya allah dan para malaikatnya mengirim rahmat ke atas mereka yang memakan sahur
8476423 barangsiapa berbuka satu hari di siang hari bulan ramadhan tanpa alasan yang wajar disegi syariah atau sakit yang kuat tidak akan dapat menampung atau mengganti hari tersebut walaupun akan berpuasa sehingga ke akhir hayatnya

8476427 eh nge blog yuk soalnya nge blog itu asik banget bermanfaat bagi kita dan orang lain bahkan bisa mencerdaskan bangsa kita lho
8476428 weve reached the point where everything that needs to be said has been said but not everyone who needs to say it has said it
8476429 one of the most dramatic flip flops of the past year has been my view on birth control pills previously i had no problem with such a friendly form of contraception some readers may even remember a stand i took in defense of the pill some months past on the comment section of my former blog in the post i virtually mocked my opponent for not being well grounded in his or her understandings of science and medicine yet now i must confess that it is i who was ignorant and arrogant today i am against using the pill my wife gladly stopped using it this past april so why the change mainly we felt that the pill was not 100 percent safe many people argue as i did that the pill is a preventative measure against pregnancy and not at all abortive however medical research shows that the components of the pill may actually prevent the fertilized egg from implanting on the uterine wall resulting in an abortion granted such an occurrence is considered very rare but how rare is rare one in a million one in a billion how about a trillion is this a game you really want to play can you have your cake and eat it too or more appropriately can you oppose abortion and possibly kill even if extremely unlikely your baby too not in the click household
8476430 the world is the devils hunting ground and children are his choicest game
8476431 the marvel of marvels is not that god in his infinite love has not elected

8476433 was right on opposing the war in iraq was right to demand a timeline was right to emphasize afghanistan and was right to call for direct talks with iran
8476434 the worst national security record of any administration in modern times
8476435 honestly i didnt think i hit it out i just thought it was going in the gap its a big part of the yard i hit it good its exciting its a huge win for us that means weve won all three of the road series now we just have to come out tomorrow and try to win
8476436 the one thing he told me early on is that he was kind of looking forward to being in the middle of all this stuff
8476437 ive always wanted to be a part of this series and to have red sox across my jersey and take the mound in a big series and get to pitch is just a blast its like a playoff game its nice when you get 11 runs behind you that made it nice too to win the game i just love to compete i love to play baseball i love to get out and battle the fact that the games count here is just fantastic for me nothing better than being in a big series
8476438 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankees series for me
8476439 you go out there and every game is crucial all of a sudden you come into this series and i kind of feel like ive been in this scenario for a month from where im coming from
8476440 when i walked into this clubhouse i remember getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away i got a smile on my face its just a good memory and this is the last year of the stadium so you think about things like that once you take the hill im just focused on the hitters and trying to get them out and help this team get to the playoffs
8476441 j d drew losing mike lowell tim wakefield for a little bit josh beckett skipped a start those are huge players on this team i feel like this team has kind of weathered that this team has a lot of character and they play really really hard its a pleasure to be a part of it
8476442 hes kind of the energizer bunny for this team hes the one who stirs stuff up just kind of everything he does he plays good defense hes got some pop hes a huge huge part of this team
8476443 the game was 7 2 and i was just trying to hit a fly ball and get one more run in
8476444 he attacked the zone he is what he is he goes out there and competes were all excited to have him around
8476445 he plays the game the right way he plays hard he plays great defense hes always in the right spot at the right time hes been huge for us
8476446 i dont think anyone is just content with winning these two games were definitely going to come out tomorrow and play as hard as we can hopefully we can win that game too theres only 30 games left or whatever it is were trying to win as many as we can
8476447 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8476448 rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world
8476449 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8476450 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
8476451 the campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8476452 he has shown a clear grasp of our foreign policy and national security challenges
8476453 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 and it will not work in 2008
8476454 to testify that barack obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8476455 after weeks of moaning and groaning about how angry he is about how mad he is at obama he made the strongest case for obama of anyone at this convention
8476456 he thinks he did a great job he wants to get his due from the guy whos succeeding him
8476457 reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8476458 how we spend our days is of course how we spend our lives
8476459 john mccain has served his country with honor but his refusal to change course even in the face of the failed policies of bush cheney is reckless and will not keep us safe
8476460 sen mccain says that american troops should remain in iraq perhaps as long as they have been stationed in korea and japan as if there were no difference in history religion or culture between our friends in asia and those in the middle east
8476461 weve been in south korea weve been in japan for 60 years weve been in south korea for 50 years or so thatd be fine with me as long as americans as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed then its fine with me i hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al qaida is training recruiting and equipping and motivating people every single day
8476462 in the last two years sen obama helped pass the new gi education bill
8476463 thought a new gi bill for todays veterans was too generous he wants to limit health care at the va to only combat injuries
8476464 we need to relieve the burden on the va from routine health care
8476465 put more of our assets in treating the unique capabilities of the va for the treatment of combat wounds as you described them both seen and unseen
8476466 if you have a routine health care need take it wherever you want to whatever doctor or health care provider and get the treatment you need
8476467 sen mccain and the republicans have centered their answer to our vital energy needs on one solution offshore drilling sen mccain calls for it in every speech his party has demagogue the issue in both houses of congress
8476468 for there is no authority except from god and all authority that exists is established by god therefore whoever resists authority opposes what god has appointed and those who oppose it will bring judgment upon themselves
8476469 if i am sure of anything i am sure that his teaching was never meant to confirm my congenital preference for safe investments and limited liabilities
8476470 doesnt belong to any ideology it belongs to all the american people
8476471 never has short term partisan politics so depleted the strength of americas bipartisan foreign policy
8476472 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8476473 he has shown a clear grasp of our foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to rebuild our badly strained military
8476474 he will choose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort
8476475 our position in the world has been weakened by too much unilateralism and too little cooperation by a perilous dependence on imported oil
8476476 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8476477 this is our dream project our plan is not to build just a shopping mall but a landmark destination for both residents and tourists alike the facilities brands services architecture and amenities will be comparable to the best in the world

8476487 and now from the fourth floor of the esteemed lariat hotel just two blocks from populist plaza and the nations presidential estate trent angeloo hows the parade trent
8476488 thats one of the territories better known mechs the dervish most of our viewers know it best from immortal warrior but a few of our better edu uh into painting viewers will also recognize it as the beast from erin tollins filtvet series
8476489 this is one of the omni models and for those of you not familiar with omni tech as they call it allows a battlemech to switch out its weapons between missions and carry powered armor
8476490 the immortal warrior never used a dervish like this one how can you tell the difference trent
8476491 well you see most of the battlemechs here are using rigged lighting from holes in their armor
8476492 they dont usually go into combat like that technicians have used access points and internal power hookups usually reserved for maintenance to light them for this night parade
8476493 now trent this guy has the markings of the 111th civil regiment arent the band of brothers supposed to be out tonight
8476494 noticeably absent tonight are the members of taits inner circle citizen of the armies james hanson who is spending time with his family on great gorge ty zhu citizen of borders who is representing the federated hellfire territories central government in st ives max grestein citizen of progress reportedly a guest at a star league technology conference on alnair and the territories citizen of information is as usual unaccounted for sources inside the peoples presidential estate have not reported seeing him yet tonight
8476495 so how is the president doing without his closest advisors
8476496 aside from a few appearances on the balcony we dont know much about whats going on inside of the ppe it could be a party with the ah good grease as they call it here on new avalon or it could be a continuation of the november talks we were told ended almost a month ago we just cant tell tonight tom
8476497 well its almost half past you see any sign of the band of brothers
8476498 no not much it it looks like the parade has ended though and that
8476499 tait has returned to the balcony of the peoples presidential estate the glare off of the protective dome over the palace is pretty bad from this angle but it seems like several of the regional leaders inside are also coming out
8476500 recreate 68 continue to do their best to shame and tar all legitimate protest at the democratic national convention by engaging in ridiculous and farcical antics real activists were seen and heard by millions of viewers as they usurped control of a live broadcast of hardball with chris matthews yesterday
8476501 he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose his policies on the economy on taxes on healthcare on energy are far superior to the republican alternative
8476502 with running mate joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding instincts and insight america will have the national security leadership we need
8476503 too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8476504 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8476505 and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8476506 when i got home and i saw a neighbour come across with her husband i was gripped with dread i couldnt believe what she was telling me the police called later and said they still dont know where the family are
8476507 hi this is bob you can send me a file
8476508 my thesis in a nutshell is that though the reformers had paul on their side in decrying merit before conversion and rightly emphasized that god freely imputes christs righteousness to a believing sinner apart from prior moral efforts nevertheless they were wrong to exclude evangelical obedience as the puritans called deeds produced by divine grace in the lives of the redeemed from having a secondary role in the way of salvation which we tread thereafter paul and james alike point to good works as the pathway to gods approval at the last judgment and they consider this future moment an integral part of justification itself for persons to be justified in the full sense gods present imputation of righteousness to those who are incorporate in christ by faith must be legitimized in the end by his approbation of an actual righteousness which he brings about in them during the meantime while faith is the ultimate condition for both events deeds are proximately conditional in their own right for the culminating event my understanding of the grammar and of the implied metaphysics of scripture requires me to engage sharply with the reformers over the issue of how christian obedience relates to justification in eschatalogical perspective sola fide is true when it describes how we first enter into a new standing with god but it oversimplifies the nature of the christian journey into the coming age with potentially disastrous effects
8476509 a fresh look at the doctrine of sola fide is needed for at least three further reasons its method violates the rule of the scriptural canon in substance stress on faith alone severs justification too cleanly from sanctification and with regard to its effects in history the doctrine is dangerous since the 1520s it has proven powerless to check repeated outbreaks of antinomianism opposition to the teaching of moral law in churches indebted to the reformation resulting in large fringes of congregants today imbued with the heresy that without mortifying sins they can nevertheless rest assured of reaching heaven

8476511 milwaukee aldermen voted 13 0 tuesday to send 36 police officers to help protect the republican national convention in st paul minn next month police chief edward flynn also revealed for the first time that he and deputy inspector denita ball will travel to st paul to observe the milwaukee units performance for one or two days of the four day convention flynn said he believed the federal government would pay all expenses for him and ball even though they wont be there for crowd control st paul police appealed to other midwestern law enforcement agencies including the wisconsin state patrol and the madison police department which arent sending officers for help in dealing with the crowds of spectators and protesters expected to descend on the convention sept 1 4 both president bush and vice president dick cheney plan to speak at the convention because the u s secret service is in charge of convention security the federal government is reimbursing all police costs flynn told the common council he wanted to send a platoon from his major incident response team partly in the spirit of mutual aid and partly to give his officers valuable training to prepare for presidential candidate visits in an election year the chief promised aldermen that police would maintain full staffing throughout the city while their colleagues are away all of the officers involved will use time off to attend the convention and the federal government will pay them at overtime rates flynn said ald jim witkowiak said his constituents were worried that police response time in milwaukee would deteriorate during the convention but witkowiak said he was reluctantly supporting the deployment for training purposes based on commitments from flynn and his command staff to maintain normal service levels council president willie hines jr said aldermen may have responded differently if the request came earlier in the summer when major incidents have been more common but with crime down the assurances that the trip wouldnt affect police service and wouldnt cost local taxpayers anything were the keys to approving flynns request hines said mayor tom barretts spokeswoman has said barrett supports the deployment for the same reasons in response to questions from aldermen flynn said his officers would be on the front lines alongside st paul police but they wouldnt have arrest powers that means they could handcuff suspects but officially a st paul officer would make the arrest and the milwaukee officer would be considered a witness the chief said wisconsin state patrol superintendent dave collins refused to send any of his state troopers after state lawyers ruled they couldnt have arrest powers st paul police spokesman tom walsh said the state patrol and madison police agreed to send officers but then backed out collins said he never agreed to anything madison police capt tom snyder told the st paul pioneer press that he had voiced interest months ago in sending officers but the formal request from st paul came too late to work out schedule conflicts with the university of wisconsin madison badgers football home opener and an ironman triathlon in addition to officers from other cities st paul police will receive logistical support from the minnesota national guard walsh said the council interrupted its august recess to approve flynns request and to grant late applications from downtown bars seeking permission for outdoor liquor sales during the 105th anniversary festivities for harley davidson inc hines took pains to note the recess was not a monthlong vacation
8476512 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
8476513 it was not only required as a good catholic to abhor and avoid abuse of power but to do something to end that abuse
8476514 i get comfort from carrying my rosary going to mass every sunday its my time alone

8476620 i never write the yankees off until the seasons over and the standings are set
8476621 theyve been around too long and been in the playoffs for such a long time that were definitely not counting them out
8476622 it couldnt have been any worse the first two games but weve got to come back tomorrow
8476623 when i walked into this clubhouse i remembered getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away and i got a smile on my face because it just has a good memory to me
8476624 and i know this is the last year of the stadium so you think about that
8476625 two games doesnt make a lifetime it doesnt make a career
8476626 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankee series for me
8476627 hes a beauty hes kind of i think the energizer bunny for this team
8476628 you know hes the one that stirs stuff up every team has got to have that guy
8476629 the seasons getting shorter we dont have many games left
8476630 this was a huge huge win for us simply because of the way we lost last night
8476631 we couldve afforded to lose but the way we lost last night you never know where thats going to lead you
8476632 you always want to see the big league team do well
8476633 it was a team effort its not about one guy or one pitcher we did a great job
8476634 were fighting some demons the demons of the past the rascals that have hung around us for a year
8476635 every time we lose a game like last night is a reminder of that

8476661 people in the maritime industry are having a difficult time understanding why anybody would want to sink a historical landmark
8476662 the ship remains uninsured and uninsurable and were in hurricane season so the risk is squarely on our shoulders right now
8476663 we need to find a way to either have a new caretaker come forward with a specific plan or have to dispose of the vessel
8476664 it is a visible sign to everybody in the community that bishop museum did not do its job
8476665 this is the gods truth she said bloody their nose so you can walk down the street the next day
8476666 work is more than a paycheck its dignity its respect
8476667 but its up to the coaches well see how it all plays out
8476668 i dont know if steves arm was as strong as andrews both are very heady and smart were all very excited for andrew its really wild one day hes at harvard the next hes at lsu and going to play geez what a great deal
8476669 but hes a very good quarterback im not surprised at all that hell be playing at lsu maybe cornerbacks or wide receivers from the ivy league couldnt play in the sec but weve had some very good quarterbacks come through here andrew is one of them
8476670 i think hes ready to perform much more than he was five 10 days ago
8476671 we know more about it now and at least have a game under our belts to try to figure out what is the best way to utilize it and how to make it advantageous and keep it from being a problem if we can utilize it productively then we will and if we cant then we wont
8476672 i dont know if they have a three down defensive player
8476673 they may be a little more challenged to use this system it isnt mandatory the only club ive heard that at least to this point wont use it is new england register for the weekly picks game now and join with your friends by jim corbett usa today
8476674 the first time i tried the radio helmet it was so loud everybody else could hear the call in our defensive huddle but me
8476675 they had it turned up so loud because we play in noisy stadiums
8476676 i told the guys on the sideline youve got to turn it down
8476677 i say to karlos after signaling in each play raise your hand if you can hear me
8476678 and it takes away that threat of someone stealing your signals which is big now
8476679 defensive coaches are saying weve leveled the playing field it will give us the ability to do some coaching on the field
8476680 the offensive geniuses are going to have to put their thinking caps back on
8476681 on the flip side are we hurting ourselves by not getting lined up not getting motion not getting exactly what you want in watching the play clock
8476682 its cool the coach can give you what hes thinking in your headset and you can play even faster
8476683 we want to make sure theres no inadvertent mistakes with using the helmets
8476684 say the offense has three wides and the safety gets run off way down the field on a deep route
8476685 now he has to sprint back to the huddle and tell everybody what the call is the linebacker is more often around the middle of the field
8476686 the one thing i have to get used to is pushing the button
8476687 the preseason is a time to get the bugs out
8476688 but the defensive headset is something we needed a long time ago to even things out
8476689 one of the big things is the players get the signal maybe two or three seconds earlier
8476690 it scares the hell out of you sometimes because pasqualoni is not the calmest guy in the world
8476691 he gets to yelling in there every play hell say watch the run watch the pass watch it
8476692 one play i was still on the ground after making a tackle and titans defensive coordinator jim schwartz was already talking to me
8476693 ive been coaching all offseason as if we werent going to have it
8476694 that way the players arent depending on it in case it goes out in the second quarter well have contingency hand signals
8476695 giving it to the linebackers is it going to stand up
8476696 im banging my head constantly the quarterback is rarely hit

8476702 slow strengthening is forecast once gustav moves farther away from haiti and the storm could regain hurricane strength within the next day or two
8476703 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8476704 as long as there is a chance that well be in this storm ill be here in louisiana

8476707 its about the democratic national convention its a big party where the democrats our party get together to decide who they want to ask everybody to vote for for president

8476709 if i was president i would build schools in africa
8476710 hey you have a foreign policy idea do you know what foreign policy is
8476711 yes you can have a donut foreign policy is when countries have ideas about other countries
8476712 i have seen the failures of bush cheney up close we cannot afford even one more day of ideological decision making
8476713 my children have lived their whole lives under the failed policies of george bush and if john mccain is elected theyll live their whole childhood under more of the same
8476714 reverse the cours that george bush john mccain and their friends in washington have set for the country
8476715 its bad enough that john mccain and my opponent steve pearce have supported every one of george bushs special interest economic policies
8476716 george bush john mccain and gordon smith have given us a government that puts oil company profits ahead of drivers pain at the pump
8476717 the administration of george bush supported by john mccain every step of the way has let our warriors down
8476718 for eight years john mccain has fallen in love with every one of george bushs national security decisions
8476719 in less than five months the bush administration will be gone finished outta here forever unless of course john mccain is elected

8476723 the makeup of the guys in this clubhouse is that they can have a 10 game losing streak and put it all behind them
8476724 you cant come off a 4 2 road trip and get swept at home thats not a good thing

8476728 im pleased with the way their guys fought through things with all the adversity and trades and things
8476729 i never write the yankees off until the seasons over and the standings are set
8476730 theyve been around too long and been in the playoffs for such a long time that were definitely not counting them out

8476736 im not writing a hall of fame career just yet but its been nice to get off to the start ive gotten off to it takes a little bit of pressure off
8476737 hes a beauty hes kind of i think the energizer bunny for this team
8476738 you know hes the one that stirs stuff up every team has got to have that guy
8476739 the seasons getting shorter we dont have many games left
8476740 we really have to come out and be perfect tomorrow
8476741 once again cisco makes a sound investment in an email technology vendor just like it did with ironpoint
8476742 these are the clever guys who reverse engineered the exchange client protocol mapi rpc and the related on the wire details needed to make a vanilla install of outlook talk to a non exchange mail server with full fidelity impressive stuff of all the other exchange alternatives postpath has the most interesting architecture and i say that as one who has years emotionally invested in the openmail technology
8476743 i think cisco fell out of love with microsoft a while back something to do with voip support in exchange and how cisco thought it was microsofts partner but it turned out that microsoft was competing with them nothing familiar there at all
8476744 sounds like cisco wants to offer saas collaboration based on postpath and webex whoever said the email world has become dull and uninteresting

8476763 and honey tonight we have a very special surprise guest
8476764 i am pleased with our first half performance even as the general advertising environment remains soft due to macroeconomic conditions our radio cluster continues to deliver solid organic growth even while facing difficult comparisons to the first half of 2007 when the segment grew by 22 our top rated internally produced television programming has allowed us to achieve significant increases in our national and agency driven advertising business which has helped offset softness in infomercial advertising revenues one of our key business strategies is to leverage the success of our internally produced programming and tap into new revenue streams such as network advertising we believe the ratings success we have achieved in television validates our leading position amongst the nations most prominent hispanic broadcasters in several of the nations largest and most competitive markets to that end we are proud to announce the launch of estrellatv a new spanish language television network featuring our successful programming which will debut in early 2009 consistent with this strategy we have entered into an agreement to purchase selected assets of television station kvpa in phoenix arizona which we are very excited about our entry into the 8th largest hispanic market in the u s with proven operating management and programming expertise should establish a positive platform for future growth

8476767 we might play two tight ends because were not ready to step out and say its malcolm brandon collins or james kirkendoll its because of inconsistency they play great one day and the next day they dont weve had one of our best camps but in some positions weve had too much inconsistency and thats why we dont have a starter
8476768 you need a guy that can get off the line and a guy who can block downfield and catch the ball thats the biggest one they all do a lot of things really well its just what they will do with 100 000 people in the bleachers

8476793 the company and union have reached tentative agreements on many of the outstanding issues but continue negotiating on a handful of topics

8476799 it basically involved taking some satellite imagery that was being taken of the state and the midwest in general and sorting it out and processing it and making it usable for people in state agencies who are trying to assess the damage of the flood
8476800 right now everyone is trying to put together a clearer picture of what happened and it is still happening
8476801 the impact of the project on the state on us as citizens of illinois is significant multiple watersheds have been affected and with them the people and animals who live there
8476802 the state as a whole was a little behind in terms of getting this imagery right away
8476803 we hope that the imagery can be used by people who are interested in assessing the damage
8476804 the first part of work to be done was the removal of asbestos from dunn barton and walker

8476811 the alleged work was done by outside vendors who did not provide receipts which is required under the illinois security deposit return act
8476812 when i walked into the bathroom i expected there to be a clump of a hair in the sink and it was literally one strand
8476813 i am responsible for initiating sustainability projects campus wide i work with anyone and everyone within the community on a given day i might be in a class giving a lecture if a faculty member asks me to come in and talk about campus sustainability or i might be working with the facilities
8476814 we have been working on green cleaning green building projects we are also planning a local food dinner through campus dining
8476815 somewhere between 35 and 50 sustainability professionals at other universities across the country now there are at least 150 sustainability professionals
8476816 it is not so much prices as it is misconceptions one thing does make a difference
8476817 sometimes its habit changing but it comes down to convenience and reprogramming ourselves
8476818 weve essentially tripled our population since the 1900s as this continues to happen we are competing for the same resources
8476819 it can get unnerving to think about the prospects of what could happen
8476820 often times students think they dont pay for it so they leave on a light
8476821 ultimately they are paying for it with tuition and every light switch does make a difference
8476822 we dig through trash cans to recycle bottles students should be recycling but arent
8476823 once we get organized we plan to put pressure on the school to go green we are also going to create the e spot which will give out environmental lifestyle guides so students can live green and find out how to do it
8476824 the strength in durable goods is just the latest indication that manufacturing is actually holding in quite well and thats a really big plus
8476825 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff
8476826 the weakness in the dollar and the strength in u s exports are acting like a bit of an automatic stabilizer for the u s economy
8476827 its a key offset at a time when other things are not so good
8476828 i think what we see is a lot of confusion right now im not sure investors really know what to do youve got oil jumping all over the place
8476829 it makes it easier because we can all start fresh and were all open to ideas i think it has been really good
8476830 we have not worked together prior to this staff but it has gone really well there is a lot of openness a good exchange of ideas and everyone is meshing well together
8476831 i never thought volleyball could be like this that the attitude and the environment in the gym could be like this
8476832 it is something i have never experienced before i am taking a huge liking to practice it is much more player centered rather than coach centered we have the ability to make decisions on the court rather than the coach just telling us what to do
8476833 i think that i was just born to help people and if my leadership can make another player better then that is great
8476834 i love encouraging others and i think that it is helping because the freshmen more so than ever in the past have jumped in and are starting to blend in
8476835 my coaches on the tour were great i knew of a couple of them but i had never been coached by any of them it is interesting to see when you can get a different perspective on coaching styles
8476836 i really liked the coaches and also liked getting an idea of playing professionally outside of college
8476837 by biking were helping both our bodies and environment and its faster than walking and driving
8476838 i think it would be a good idea if flyers were put into registered student organization mailboxes especially the environmental groups so they can help promote the program
8476839 we will ideally want to have different sites in the residence halls where students can rent bicycles
8476840 if they are going to get more bicycles then they should really put out more bike racks
8476841 i think the state should put a moratorium on closing our facilities and then start to deal with the process when you have a building that is structurally sound and serves the purpose it was meant to fulfill there is no logic to it
8476842 in a town of 11 000 people this facility employs about 600
8476843 we had over 2 000 people show up at our hearing it was the largest gathering at a public hearing in illinois history
8476844 this facility is in the community and theres not one person in that area who doesnt know somebody who works there
8476845 i think theres an overwhelming number of negatives and i dont really see any positives
8476846 but how does that compare with the 54 million dollar approximately two weeks the committee reviewing the closing will vote on the issue soon thereafter they will submit their report to governor blagojevich
8476847 the governor cannot close the penitentiary until the report is issued
8476848 this really slows the process down and allows you to get the facts out there you get a real understanding of the overcrowding and the economic impact
8476849 are sources of wisdom guidance inspiration and counsel if you take them seriously they can literally change your life
8476850 top tier advisory services to public sector organisations in dubai other emirates and the mena middle east and northern africa region

8476853 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8476854 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8476855 as we reduce the size of our fleet and take other actions to enable united to compete in this environment of record fuel prices we must take the difficult but necessary steps to reduce the number of people we have to run our operation
8476856 current position does not do justice to our needs and demands and does not match the pattern set by the u s steel agreement
8476857 the company and union have reached tentative agreements on many of the outstanding issues but continue negotiating on a handful of topics
8476858 but it usually is a sign of impatience in bargaining
8476859 a strike vote is putting a bullet in the chamber
8476860 a sign that negotiations have really reached a stage where intensity in bargaining is necessary and you have to break from the past trend
8476861 on wednesday the head of accommodations for chicago 2016 olympic committee met with a handful of hotel managers from northern indiana the candidate city is trying to persuade hotels to block off 85 of their rooms for more than two weeks it is estimated that more than 60 000 rooms will be needed for the 2016 games there are 40 000 rooms available in the city but the rest will have to come from elsewhere
8476862 big clarification i must make it absolutely clear that when i use the term racing paul newman on the back roads i do not mean racing in the sense of kids challenging each other to see who can go faster i mean racing in a sense of bored teenagers driving around seeking thrills in the middle of the night and a car would come from behind out of nowhere to drive along side our car several seconds long enough to see who all was in the car to see if his son was in the car and then be gone again in a flash we had to look quickly to be able to identify who was driving and we had to be even quicker and be in a fast car to try and keep pace with or try and overtake the car which i dont recall might have happened but once cuz it didnt go on for long at all and the car escaped by turning down a side road but we double checked on a couple occasions to see the identical car in paul newmans driveway and the car hood over the engine was warm to touch with myself not having grown up around a present loving father and so many absent affluent parents in westport ct so many kids did not really have a dad around much much less such an involved dad so it struck me so deeply to see such a famous father putting so much at risk to go out and actively look for and save their beloved child who was getting caught up in the reckless times of growing up in the day in the summer of 1969 as i became to learn what god was about as a loving father loving his son i was reminded of paul newman as a living example of a father and his great love for his son and then after the horrible tragic accidental loss of scott and the phenomenal empire that paul newman built to reach out to help so many other children served as another living example to me of how mighty and awesome of a father that god is and the incredible miracles and programs children healed and helped that resulted and sprung forth as a result of a death of a son but anyway in no way do i want to imply in any way whatsoever that paul newman was out drag racing teenage kids on backroads to see who can go faster because frankly usually it was no race because usually it was like a phantom car that would suddenly appear from behind and drive up along side long enough to be able to identify and we were left in the smoke in the distance unless our driver floored the gas pedal what memories of a lifetime many years ago
8476863 important statement i absolutely do not support anyone any kids or any teenagers doing any of the harmful activites that i have described nor do i support anyone engaging in any illegal or harmful activities substance abuse or breaking any laws
8476864 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8476865 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8476866 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8476867 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8476868 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8476869 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
8476870 laughed at the suggestion and certainly did not call mccain on it

8476877 a kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop words when speech becomes superfluous
8476878 my night has become a sunny dawn because of you
8476879 in real love you want the other persons good in romantic love you want the other person
8476880 love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies
8476881 each moment of a happy lovers hour is worth an age of dull and common life
8476882 your words are my food your breath my wine you are everything to me
8476883 in my wildest dreams you always play the hero in my darkest hour of night you rescue me you save my life
8476884 come live with me and be my love and we will some new pleasures prove of golden sands and crystal beaches with silken lines and silver hooks
8476885 what i do and what i dream include thee as the wine must taste of its own grapes
8476886 i love thee to the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach
8476887 but to see her was to love her love but her and love her forever
8476888 like music on the waters is they sweet voice to me
8476889 i love you not only for what you are but for what i am when i am with you
8476890 love distills desire upon the eyes love brings bewitching grace into the heart
8476891 i wished for nothing beyond her smile and to walk with her thus hand in hand along a sun warmed flower bordered path
8476892 love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own
8476893 where we love is home home that our feet may leave but not our hearts
8476894 what i feel for you seems less of earth and more of a cloudless heaven
8476895 its so easy to think about love to talk about love to wish for love but its not always easy to recognize love even when we hold it in our hands
8476896 two souls with but a single thought two hearts that beat as one
8476897 the best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched they must be felt with the heart
8476898 see theres this place in me where your fingerprints still rest your kisses still linger and your whispers softly echo its the place where a part of you will forever be a part of me
8476899 when you came you were like red wine and honey and the taste of you burnt my mouth with its sweetness
8476900 oh thou art fairer than the evening air clad in the beauty of a thousand stars
8476901 in the arithmetic of love one plus one equals everything and two minus one equals nothing
8476902 we came by night to the fortunate isles and lay like fish under the net of our kisses
8476903 the hours i spend with you i look upon as sort of a perfumed garden a dim twilight and a fountain signing to it you and you alone make me feel that i am alive other men it is said have seen angels but i have seen thee and thou art enough
8476904 i become a waterwheel turning and tasting you as long as water moves
8476905 i miss you even more than i could have believed and i was prepared to miss you a good deal
8476906 life has taught us that love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction
8476907 it is only with the heart that one can see rightly what is essential is invisible to the eye
8476908 there is only one happiness in life to love and be loved
8476909 sometimes your nearness takes my breath away and all the things i want to say can find no voice then in silence i can only hope my eyes will speak my heart
8476910 the more i give to thee the more i have for both are infinite
8476911 love is but the discovery of ourselves in others and the delight in the recognition
8476912 her breath is like honey spiced with cloves her mouth delicious as a ripened mango
8476913 love till dawn sunder night from day with fire dividing my delight and my desire
8476914 within you i lose myself without you i find myself wanting to become lost again
8476915 i see my fated stars in your eyes they melt me like the sun does snow
8476916 the rose speaks of love silently in a language known only to the heart
8476917 to be your friend was all i ever wanted to be your lover was all i ever dreamed
8476918 if i could reach up and hold a star for every time you made me smile i would have the whole night sky in the palm of my hand
8476919 if you love me only in my dreams let me be asleep forever
8476920 kiss me and you will see stars love me and i will give them to you
8476921 love is a dream that comes alive when we meet
8476922 the soul that can speak with its eyes can also kiss with a gaze
8476923 love is something eternal the aspect may change but not the essense
8476924 here are fruits flowers leaves and branches and here is my heart which beats only for you
8476925 when a heart finds another whats a cloud more or less in the sky
8476926 the most precious possession that ever comes to a man in this world is a womans heart
8476927 from every human being there rises a light that reaches straight to heaven and when two souls that are destined to be together find each other their streams of light flow together and a single brighter light goes forth from their united being
8476928 the most wonderful of all things in life is the discovery of another human being with whom ones relationship has a growing depth beauty and joy as the years increase this inner progressiveness of love between two human beings is a most marvelous thing it cannot be found by looking for it or by passionately wishing for it it is a sort of divine accident and the most wonderful of all things in life
8476929 love means to commit oneself without guarantee to give oneself completely in the hope that our love will produce love in the loved person love is an act of faith and whoever is of little faith is also of little love
8476930 you come to love not by finding the perfect person but by seeing an imperfect person perfectly
8476931 the most powerful symptom of love is a tenderness which becomes at times almost insupportable
8476932 true love begins when nothing is looked for in return
8476933 love is the emblem of eternity it confounds all notion of time effaces all memory of a beginning all fear of an end
8476934 the life and love we create is the life and love we live
8476935 for every beauty there is an eye somewhere to see it for every truth there is an ear somewhere to hear it for every love there is a heart somewhere to receive it
8476936 listening is an attitude of the heart a genuine desire to be with another which both attracts and heals
8476937 being deeply loved by someone gives you strength while loving someone deeply gives you courage
8476938 the most eloquent silence that of two mouths meeting in a kiss
8476939 since love grows within you so beauty grows for love is the beauty of the soul
8476940 true love is eternal infinite and always like itself it is equal and pure without violent demonstrations it is seen with white hairs and is always young in the heart
8476941 we are all born for love it is the principle existence and its only end
8476942 love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness
8476943 love doesnt make the world go round love is what makes the ride worthwhile
8476944 to get the full value of joy you must have someone to divide it with
8476945 if i know what love is it is because of you
8476946 so dear i love him that with him all deaths i could endure without him live no life
8476947 love is like a friendship caught on fire in the beginning a flame very pretty often hot and fierce but still only light and flickering as love grows older our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals deep burning and unquenchable
8476948 how delicious is the winning of a kiss at loves beginning
8476949 one word frees us of all the weight and pain in life that word is love
8476950 there is no remedy for love but to love more
8476951 if i had a flower for every time i thought of you i could walk in my garden forever
8476952 i thought time wouldve helped ease that pain but it opened up so many wounds
8476953 the very first year my daughter was missing one of the students called to wish me happy mothers day and i broke down
8476954 its as if youre running against a brick wall what do you do where do you go
8476955 nu vasile tu nu trebuie sa cari greutati tu te vei duce la scoala si vei pleca din aceste locuri
8476956 that would be cool if she knew sasuke and actually knew what we were doing
8476957 ones mind is the gateway to more gateways presenting myriad of possibilities for which one can be innovative at

8476963 this is a win win situation for medicine and ethics
8476964 he says mom i need you to come get me theres ambulance and fire trucks here so it really scared me
8476965 its a narrow road and its hard for the bus driver to back in and obviously with the wet dirt it looks like it slid in
8476966 she pulled up and then she backed out and she had to do it two more times and she backed back in and then she fell into the ditch
8476967 im not so surprised to hear some of these hawkish sounds coming from the ecb they are facing after all inflation that is double their target
8476968 the big story continues to be about the euro zone and japan and the disappointment in relative growth people knew the situation in the u s wasnt great but they are now having to face a deceleration in the euro zone a lot quicker than many had anticipated
8476969 the only reason i got her out and my nephew went along with it
8476970 we thought to get her daughter back shed discuss it
8476971 maybe we got duped a little bit maybe we overestimated her
8476972 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8476973 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8476974 our troops are courageous strong fierce this administration has redeployed them until they are overstretched stressed and strained

8476987 she was going into a store at 118 avenue and 47 street
8476988 we just chatted for a few minutes she seemed less scruffy than when we partied together
8476989 it bothers me to think that she was there so close to strathcona county where her body was found

8476998 your local department of health should be interested in this information a they served adulterated food b when advised of adulterated food they did not require the diner to surrender the dish for replacement the diner had to request this obvious action c when requested by the diner the dish was not replaced any establishment that will lie and reserve a contaminated dish will likely commit other health violations

8477026 when thomas svekla was captured we were hoping that that was the end of it all
8477027 i think some people who live in the city their whole lives and they come just barely out into the country they think theyre in the middle of nowhere when theyre dumping these bodies
8477028 but in reality these bodies are being found just very close to all kinds of people
8477029 you think you would finally stop finding these bodies but theres a lot of land out here

8477116 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8477117 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8477118 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8477119 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8477120 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8477173 canada stop deporting us soldiers who refuse to fight in the illegal war in iraq
8477174 in the year that franz jagerstater was beatified by the pope in recognition of his conscientious objection and subsequent execution for refusing to serve in hitlers army it seems extraordinary that the canadian government is adopting this position these soldiers have every right to refuse to fight in an illegal war

8477187 the democrats nominated a junior inexperienced senator with no legislative accomplishments on his resume to whom young americans and latte liberals swarmed due to his cool celebrity like demeanor but then those same democratic leaders act surprised that middle america isnt following suit how bizarre
8477188 the meltdown of progressive blogosphere 1 0 is due in large part to major a list bloggers turning a blind eye to misogyny and sexism because it helped the candidate they supported massive fail

8477196 the dirty secret of clean energy is that while generating it is getting easier moving it to market is not
8477197 the basic problem is that many transmission lines and the connections between them are simply too small for the amount of power companies would like to squeeze through them the difficulty is most acute for long distance transmission but shows up at times even over distances of a few hundred miles
8477198 politicians in washington have long known about the grids limitations but have made scant headway in solving them they are reluctant to trample the prerogatives of state governments which have traditionally exercised authority over the grid and have little incentive to push improvements that would benefit neighboring states
8477199 the power grid is balkanized with about 200 000 miles of power lines divided among 500 owners big transmission upgrades often involve multiple companies many state governments and numerous permits every addition to the grid provokes fights with property owners
8477200 these barriers mean that electrical generation is growing four times faster than transmission according to federal figures

8477295 from a tax policy perspective the approaches of the two candidates are vastly different senator obama emphasizes who gets what and senator mccain focuses on economic growth and broadly reshaping how the tax system affects household and business decisions to put it differently one focuses on redistribution and the other focuses on improving economic incentives also focusing on who gets what is by its very nature more near term while promoting economic growth is more long term one cannot get a good picture of what the candidates are trying to achieve by considering only the individual tax or the business tax provisions one needs to apply a more holistic approach and consider the full set of proposals senator obama provides tax relief directly to individuals without major changes in how the tax system interacts with or affects individual and business decision making senator mccain provides broad tax relief and channels most of it to businesses with the notion that the best way to help workers is to encourage investment and ensure that the u s remains competitive in the global marketplace the policies present very different choices redistribution versus economic growth and short run versus long term
8477296 from a tax policy perspective the approaches of the two candidates are vastly different
8477297 2012 was to have been the year jfk jr swept into capitol hill
8477298 many loyal dems are stil aggrieved at the lack of an autopsy and the hurried cremation of the tragic pilot
8477299 he had the clintons over a barrel look out for a whopping great big obama spoiler later in the week
8477300 i noticed you like sisterhood of the traveling pants i like those books as well i just saw the second movie
8477301 yeah my mom says theyre good for me at this adolescent stage of my development

8477305 there are usually some excellent comics performing and the book readings can be awesome same for the performance pieces
8477306 dont expect that you will make it from venue to venue in five minutes
8477307 reports of strong support within john mccains presidential campaign for independent democratic sen
8477308 she thought she was to have been the chosen one
8477309 but clintons unethical remarks during the campaign brought on attacks anyone could rightfully make about her
8477310 the end of bill clintons presidency in 2001 closed a remarkable chapter in the new democrat i
8477311 the obama campaign is panicked that terrorist and obama benefactor bill ayers has reared his ugly head into this campaign but is it really swiftboating there is a convincing case to be made that obama is simply being vetted something the media failed to do throughout his short national career the charges are all true and thats why they are panicked
8477312 two people can keep a secret if one if one of them is dead
8477313 we democrats are at a fork in the road we have to stop playing off the failures of the other guys we have to stop rearranging little issues every month like so many cards on the table we need passion we need big dreams and we need to show a way into the future most importantly that resonates with the deepest values of americans and with the hopes and dreams that they have for themselves and they have for their children
8477314 i refuse to believe in made up and doctored evidence
8477315 john mccain will fight to keep the government out of health care
8477316 he has one stomach and he is eating normally with his two mouths he has one genital organ and a full set of limbs
8477317 he was born from one embryo but there was a developmental anomaly
8477318 i never write the yankees off until the seasons over and the standings are set
8477319 theyve been around too long and been in the playoffs for such a long time that were definitely not counting them out
8477320 it couldnt have been any worse the first two games but weve got to come back tomorrow
8477321 when i walked into this clubhouse i remembered getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away and i got a smile on my face because it just has a good memory to me
8477322 and i know this is the last year of the stadium so you think about that
8477323 two games doesnt make a lifetime it doesnt make a career
8477324 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankee series for me
8477325 im not writing a hall of fame career just yet but its been nice to get off to the start ive gotten off to it takes a little bit of pressure off
8477326 hes a beauty hes kind of i think the energizer bunny for this team
8477327 you know hes the one that stirs stuff up every team has got to have that guy
8477328 the seasons getting shorter we dont have many games left
8477329 we really have to come out and be perfect tomorrow
8477330 amaldi oada por todos os pante es do mundo conhecido
8477331 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
8477332 there is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket
8477333 this is a sad moment and look hes not doing it
8477334 swung it once or twice and said i dont want to do it anymore
8477335 it was an emotional time and the children were happy they asked for it no one forced anyone
8477336 the cps wishes to make it clear that this prosecution was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims
8477337 and if obama proves he can manage the clintons voters might actually believe he can handle the russians the terrorists and the rest of the tough guys around the world
8477338 obama himself put that in motion by giving them so much convention air time and a roll call vote for her nomination
8477339 bill clinton made it fairly clear that he is uncomfortable at best with an obama presidency in that interview that he did on abc
8477340 the buzz about obamas pick for vice president expected any day now is irrelevant background noise no one votes for second banana people vote for commander in chief leadership and empathy at the top of the ticket matter much more than any consultants notion of balance at the bottom
8477341 obama would be the figurehead he can be the guy smiling for the cameras and taking all the credit when things are going well a role that suits him
8477342 some site other than the internets version of the enquirer
8477343 i want you to want me i need you to need me
8477344 and i am tired of clinging to my guns and religion and fear of black men
8477345 say what you will about republicans making a muddle of governing but they sure know how to campaign the turn of events that john mccain and his team have engineered in recent weeks is one of the most significant events of the campaign and now poses a serious threat of an upset this fall
8477346 mr d it is always about the money with you
8477347 gordo has been posting his stuff on here for at least 6 months at any time has he been right about anything
8477348 theres an old saying in show business no one knows anything
8477349 patsi you wonderful smart witty sharp sensible talented bewitching woman you
8477350 i really wonder about those obama books they really seem like a ghost writer had a hand in them definitely for polishing if not writing the entire manuscript
8477351 it could be taking a second look and finally figuring out that you had it right the first time and blew it
8477352 no matter how eloquent how persuasive i think obama is a phony a contrived pr candidate as designed by axelrod reminds me of that awful pacino movie simone
8477353 ive always thought they were carefully written with the idea that he would be running for president why would someone so young write two books about themselves before they were well known
8477354 the answer if you dont have 5 million dollars or multiple homes should be no
8477355 again this is not some deep dark secret nefarious plot but some vile plot for world dominion is rarely in the cards
8477356 the cloak of media invisibility is slowly beginning to lift from barack obamas most important administrative leadership experience helming an expensive educational reform effort in chicago
8477357 the relationship between the ambitious obama and the unrepentant ayers is a subject that excites republicans who havent really thwacked that pinata as hard as they might
8477358 its the same thing with his lies about baipa these documents will contradict recent statements hes made and hell be further shown to be the prevaricator we know him to be from what we hear on the ground here in chicago theres something big erupting relating to these papers baipa and the sudden odd retirement of state senate president emile jones soetorobamas mentor and ladder to his us senate seat and all of this is connected to tony rezko somehow but its a complicated web prosecutor patrick fitzgerald is still working on making progress daily with perhaps new developments come october
8477359 although she backed barack obama in june stephanie tubbs jones has said obama cant win unless clintons supporters rally behind him
8477360 she is a passionate and tireless advocate for the people of cleveland and a devoted public servant for all americans
8477361 we send our heartfelt prayers to stephanie and her family at this very difficult time
8477362 i would bet that 90 percent of you didnt even know her before she placed her political life at risk by support hrc a thirty second public statement would have made a nice impact on her importance as a friend and political ally
8477363 and these are the people we tied yellow ribbons for and bush patted on the back if we dont reenact the draft i dont think well have anyone to chase bin laden to the gates of hell
8477364 there are few words to express the shock we feel at this time our deepest condolences are with stephanies son mervyn her family and her many loved ones friends and supporters
8477365 i hope he doesnt select hrc as his vp choice if shes not his choice but the one he feels compelled to make
8477366 just saying that it would have been more personal to speak to the nation about her than a statement
8477367 stj was there for you and you couldnt come on camera and say how terrible this is
8477368 obama paid 300 000 less than the asking price for his mansion while tony rezkos wife paid full price for a vacant lot next door on the very same day
8477369 two years ago obama bought a mansion on the south side in the kenwood neighborhood from a doctor on the same day antoin tony rezkos wife rita rezko bought the vacant lot next door from the same seller the doctor had listed the properties for sale together he sold the house to obama for 300 000 below the asking price the doctor got his asking price on the lot from rezkos wife
8477370 the obamas and rezkos took a trip together to rezkos home at lake geneva wi
8477371 barack and michelle obama visited their home in lake geneva once for the day
8477372 i think bill is going to come through with his speech
8477373 both john nichols the most sensible writer for the nation hes very left but not so caustic he said nice things about tony snow when he died for example and nate silver of fivehtiryeight com are now both pushing for hillary for vp there appears to be a bit of panic in the obama camp ayers and the infanticide issue are not going away and the appearance of a cover up on obamas relationship to annenberg and bill ayers only draws more attention to his track record of failure as a reformer
8477374 take it for someone whos been a writer for twenty years
8477375 to find my books check the library and bookstores youll find them there
8477376 if you take the obama campaign at its word the contention that there is a relationship between bill ayers and barack obama is
8477377 id buy some of bye byes works and would praise them if i liked them
8477378 sometime i wonder if the warring parties would do better without the inflammatory comments of others
8477379 geezer moment thats funny why john mccain had no idea how many homes he owns
8477380 we saw this one coming hillary didnt end her campaign she suspended it her operatives have been working on this for months this is going to be one bloody battle the clintonostra vs the most corrupt political machine in america chicago gangland style poltics
8477381 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
8477382 dont worry patsi nobody would every suspect you of being anything other than white
8477383 on lonely nights his mind always wandered to what if
8477384 hes out of control i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love

8477391 the us navy destroyer uss mcfaul which is currently docked in the georgian port of batumi carries about 50 tomahawk cruise missiles on board they are outfitted with nuclear warheads and are meant to hit ground targets the remaining nato ships are currently concentrated in the northern part of the black sea
8477392 it is strange that such a large group of nato warships has arrived for a joint exercise with bulgaria or romania usually only one or two warships participate in such exercises so the attempts to substantiate the presence of the naval group with a military exercise does not withstand any criticism
8477393 it is clear that all statements made by the political and defense administration of nato members are accompanied with outspoken militarist demarches the use of nuclear weapons by nato ships in the black sea is out of the question the conventional weapons which the nato naval group has in the region are more than enough to achieve any defense goals which can be exemplified with yugoslavia
8477394 this was a huge huge win for us simply because of the way we lost last night
8477395 we couldve afforded to lose but the way we lost last night you never know where thats going to lead you
8477396 you always want to see the big league team do well
8477397 it was a team effort its not about one guy or one pitcher we did a great job
8477398 were fighting some demons the demons of the past the rascals that have hung around us for a year
8477399 every time we lose a game like last night is a reminder of that
8477400 i think the race will come down to the end
8477401 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8477402 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8477403 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8477404 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8477405 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8477406 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8477407 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
8477408 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8477409 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8477410 the clinton and obama camps orchestrated a roll call that pleased most everyone upset almost no one and provided an historic moment for the nightly newscasts
8477411 it was another attempt by the party to show a united front coming out of this convention something that looks more possible by the day
8477412 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8477413 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8477414 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8477415 when i called she said umm which dog are we talking about again
8477416 we built our homes out of palm leaves i saw animals id never seen before he taught me the medicinal properties of all the plants we picked fruit off the trees we swam with and ate piranhas and of course we had sex for almost two weeks
8477417 i got to stay in the jungle and he got to have sex with a cute young american girl
8477418 its more about getting what you want than getting what you need
8477419 unless you think everyone needs a 200 louis vuitton bag
8477420 women are turned on just by the simple idea of their guy getting off his ass and doing something for them
8477421 give it to me first thing in the morning and ill play handyman all day
8477422 theyll touch my hand and theres all this physical contact or theyll run around in their pajamas
8477423 i was painting the hallway right outside a clients bedroom and she was lying on her bed like a girl at a slumber party with her legs up and her arms crossed and her head resting on them asking me if i had a girlfriend
8477424 its all about the fantasy of being taken by the rough hewn construction guy
8477425 i dont get anybody in my office who says my husband sits on the couch all day and eats bonbons and i want to have sex with him all the time
8477426 oh thats too bad but i cant do anything so
8477427 it shows that small business confidence in the rudd government has collapsed to the lowest level ever
8477428 the rudd government is now the one government in australia in which small business has the least confidence
8477429 they have relentlessly treasurer mr wayne swan and prime minister mr kevin rudd talked up inflation and talked down the economy
8477430 they have undermined confidence and they have undermined prospects for jobs prospects for business and prosperity
8477431 mr swan wanted to create an inflation crisis he wanted to drive interest rates up so that he could pin the blame on the previous government
8477432 well mr swan succeeded in driving interest rates up he succeeded in driving business confidence down and hes succeeding in driving australians out of jobs
8477433 the emissions trading scheme is nothing more than a tax
8477434 it is effectively a tax on the use and certainly the emissions of carbon and in the end australians all of us are going to pay for it
8477435 it will increase the price of everything from energy to transport and fuel it is likely to see industries and jobs go to other parts of the world
8477436 this is the most significant economic transformation that we will see in our country
8477437 there is an enormous amount at stake and mr rudd seems to not think things through
8477438 he mr rudd doesnt seem to appreciate whats at stake here in terms of pensioners families jobs and australian industries
8477439 weve said from day one that this is a very substantial reform
8477440 out there there is a broad understanding of the significance of the reform that were undertaking here
8477441 the prosecution case has many weaknesses not least of which is the evidence of dr hussain himself but it is not so devoid of evidence that there is no case
8477442 being given a list of questions in advance provided him an opportunity to ensure that his evidence was consistent something no doubt a jury would take into account when assessing his evidence
8477443 when it was shown to him he was very very pleased indeed
8477444 he could only widen his eyes or something like that but it was explained to him and he was thrilled
8477445 it probably did as much as the injections they were giving him
8477446 doctors dont usually make predictions but they are predicting that within three days they will be able to feed him solids and that should build up his strength
8477447 how are these cuts to essential services for queensland women consistent with the premiers focus this week on mothers and babies
8477448 we have a commitment to expanding maternity services to the bush and we will continue to do so
8477449 i tell him he being too rough with your nail bed he gonna hurt your nail bed
8477450 will you look at this bitches nails she hasnt been in for a fill in at least 4 weeks and she expects us to just fix her nails up now for 14 if so that is one crazy bitch
8477451 the only person with a garage door opener is my brother and hes at work and why would he be coming over here this time of night anyway
8477452 no no no no no no no no no shut the door shut the door no no no no
8477453 were you naked sarah thinks you were naked you werent naked were you
8477454 thats so nasty you sit around your house naked on your furniture naked thats gross thats just gross who does that
8477455 a determination to challenge new threats not ignore them or simply wait for future tragedy
8477456 barack obama and i will end this neglect we will hold russia accountable for its actions
8477457 look he beat me i still cant believe it but he beat me i hate him for it but whatever hell lose and ill be back in the meantime hes a democrat which makes him better than a republican so i guess wed better suck it up and vote for him
8477458 well do everything that we feel we can what more can anyone do this arrogant punk coughed up by the white chicago mob and the black chicago racists is unelectable we know that most of you only sense it but we know it we tried to tell you you dumb bells wouldnt listen to plain talk from arkansas still me and my muffin are true pros not to mention democrats of course we will do what we can well do it despite the obvious impossible odds you expect a miracle okay yall well do everything we can for the miracle you are dreaming of lets have a little fun dream away
8477459 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8477460 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8477461 obviously my party wasnt going to nominate a black candidate for the white house so im glad democrats did it
8477462 were in a real close real tight race and this guy has a real shot at winning at the end of the day this is an extraordinary candidate
8477463 the bottom line is clinton gave great lines but that doesnt give barack the commander in chief credibility
8477464 after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that sen obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8477465 she said obama was unprepared to lead unprepared to be the commander in chief that he was unprepared to handle the 3 a m call
8477466 he said you have candidate x who you agree with 100 percent of the time but you dont think can get the job done and you have candidate y who you agree with half the time but can get the job done
8477467 who do you think is y and who do you think is x i suspect that the clintons still are under a serious question as to obamas preparedness
8477468 i was not just disappointed but rather i was insulted
8477469 obama has no record whatsoever doing that and john mccain has a long record of doing that so that should be at the core of the response
8477470 caseys maintained that shes protecting caylee and shes also protecting the family from physical harm we believe that 100 percent
8477471 we would not have performed these tests if we didnt think there was something there
8477472 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8477473 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8477474 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8477475 as an african american and a lesbian i havent been through one day without facing some sort of discrimination but this is just shocking
8477476 we believe that the actions of the contract security guard were inappropriate and unacceptable we have notified his company paragon of our position in the matter
8477477 i haven t seen this type of blatant discrimination in a federal office building before

8477479 the centers benefit from strong and growing demographics including more than 485 000 residents within a 15 mile radius and average household incomes within a one mile radius of over 95 000
8477480 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8477481 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8477482 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8477483 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8477484 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8477485 i would say this is the biggest response weve ever got from a campaign or a candidate
8477486 this is really unprecedented with the show the way that people are flooding the calls and our email boxes
8477487 he got into the files just yesterday so we wanted to have him on to find out what he found and if at all possible we wanted to get the obama campaign to get their side of the story
8477488 thats why the uproar is kind of amazing because we wanted the obama campaigns take as well to kind of balance it out

8477493 the government again has probably been sitting on its hands but nevertheless theres a solution
8477494 we want to make sure that the very basic rights that workers need rights like being able to join a union bargain collectively and participate in debates about their workplaces and industries are front and centre of the new legislation
8477495 many are low paid and many come from non english speaking backgrounds
8477496 in 2005 the previous commonwealth government agreed to include the public interest monitor in the application process for preventative detention orders under its terrorism legislation
8477497 but it would not agree to our request to amend commonwealth legislation to include the public interest monitor in the case of phone tap warrant applications
8477498 this is about striking the right balance between important police activities and very legitimate privacy concerns of our citizens
8477499 i thank the prime minister for working with the queensland government to secure an outcome that protects our citizens this is collaborative federalism at work
8477500 every other state in australia has telephone interception powers but queenslands labor government has deliberately resisted for 10 years
8477501 the lnp has maintained its support for telephone interception powers and twice introduced the relevant legislation for it to happen
8477502 both times the beattie bligh government have voted down the legislation denying our states law enforcement officers the valuable resource they deserve
8477503 patients dont generally sit in waiting rooms for 24 hours they sit in corridors
8477504 this is a regular occurrence its been the worst i have seen it in a good number of years
8477505 elective surgery is the only thing we have any control over
8477506 we need something radical like putting elective cancer surgery on hold
8477507 we need to get away from 100 per cent occupancy at hospitals and get it down to 80 per cent to cope during the peak demand
8477508 we need about 20 per cent more beds in hospitals across queensland
8477509 we are building more hospitals we have open 778 new hospital beds over the last couple of years we have opened new emergency departments at prince charles hospital expanded the emergency departments at redcliffe caboolture and i could go on
8477510 we have population growth of about two per cent a year yet our emergency department presentations are increasing by 10 per cent a year and in some parts of the state like the gold coast and townsville over 30 per cent a year
8477511 sen obama to join sen obama on stage after his acceptance speech
8477512 the matter was settled at a major meeting of mccains advisers
8477513 the mccain campaign is hoping to have 15 000 people at the ohio rally roughly five times the size of his largest crowd to date
8477514 with a growing economy and a growing population we are going to add spaces every year
8477515 you choose not only your career you choose your future a wrong choice cant ruin your life you can always change everything and start once again but it is better not to make a mistake choose your career very carefully remember no one can do this for you its your future it must be your choice from your own hand parents must understand and support their children parents can help you to choose your way but they cant push you against yourself
8477516 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8477517 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8477518 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8477519 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8477520 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8477521 i dont know about you but i wish they would have used red brick on the exterior
8477522 to pad watchers like professor prabhas pintoptang of chulalongkorns faculty of political science the coalition has been seen as planting structural hatred and division in society on a scale far worse than that ever achieved by the previous government under ousted premier thaksin shinawatra
8477523 only chamlong srimuang and sondhi limthongkul have the ability to control mobs when they the protesters dont have leaders they wont have leadership and theyll become lost

8477528 there may be a bit of argy bargy on the way through but i think its time to do this
8477529 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8477530 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8477531 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8477532 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8477533 the real challenge for mr rudd is will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply
8477534 an israeli national was abducted in the city yesterday tuesday we are still checking the details of the incident
8477535 we are doing everything for this case to end as soon as possible and at best that this man returns home
8477536 we may assist the israeli government in locating and negotiating the release of the hostage if requested to do so through its ambassador
8477537 this is not the first foreigner kidnapped in the past two weeks
8477538 on monday the rubber dinghy started taking water and it overturned with the immigrants drowned
8477539 they just kept holding on to the dinghy until last night they were spotted by the maltese fishing vessel
8477540 my appeal goes to the government to release these immigrants from the detention centre because of their health and traumatic conditions
8477541 notwithstanding that they know about previous tragedies these desperate people still try and make the journey to europe
8477542 governments only get one opportunity to sell a public asset and if they decide to sell its essential that taxpayers get the best possible price
8477543 thats not possible given the current uncertainty in the energy sector
8477544 lets wrestle to see who gets to be on top first
8477545 i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me i dont know how i can prove that but feel free to test me
8477546 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8477547 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8477548 english is very much creatively driven its mostly analysis and interpretation and history of literature and basically the entire bachelors degree in english is all about bullshitting things and computer science which was my other major was exactly the opposite of that you had to know what you were doing and you had to know what you were talking about
8477549 well how is this as deep as i want it to be how is it as interesting as i want it to be
8477550 i didnt feel like i had the opportunity for creativity as a player to do things that i want to do there was only one solution to the puzzles
8477551 i see this you know and heres what this means to me etc
8477552 im all about games and narrative and meaning and i write a blog just to tell you about how i analyze all these things
8477553 i understand why he brings up the a bomb during the epilogue
8477554 what is the epilogue about and what is it for
8477555 oh this prose is terrible it reads like a 12 year old wrote it
8477556 the princess has been kidnapped by a horrible and evil monster
8477557 oh this prose reads like a twelve year old wrote it its just way too unthinking and it reads like goth poetry in a high school notebook
8477558 wow this prose is lifeless it doesnt spring from the heart of the writer as blood from the pen
8477559 isnt that the opposite of what the other guy just said what does that mean that people are regarding this in such different ways
8477560 is existence pre destined or do we have free will
8477561 oh im just born and theres somebody out there theres the one whos meant for me and im going to meet them in my life and then were going to be happy forever
8477562 oh well theres god and god made that person born near me and then makes sure that neither of us died so that we meet each other

8477566 the hope is that after watching this speech people will know a little bit more about who
8477567 perhaps you should research mr franks record a little more
8477568 inside the envelope is a prediction of the exact card you will select
8477569 and a beautiful thing it was but not much use in a fight
8477570 its not the camera that takes the photo its the photographer
8477571 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8477572 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8477573 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8477574 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8477575 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8477576 millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up
8477577 watch therefore for you do not know on what day your lord is coming
8477578 who then is the faithful and wise servant whom his master has set over his household to give them their food at the proper time 46 blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing 47 truly i say to you he will set him over all his possessions 48 but if that wicked servant says to himself my master is delayed 49 and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with the drunken 50 the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know 51 and will punish him and put him with the hypocrites there men will weep and gnash their teeth
8477579 we might go out to serve food we might be going out to hand out clean up kits to the people affected by the storm
8477580 the lessons from katrina were very profound pre deployment pre positioning of materials as well as people was one of the greatest lessons learned

8477594 the future competitiveness of the united states is inextricably linked to the investments we make today to improve education enhance learning and provide our students with the skills and knowledge that will afford them the opportunity to succeed among the best and brightest competitors in the world
8477595 the presidential candidates have an opportunity to develop solid education platforms focused on achieving this goal
8477596 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8477597 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom

8477599 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8477600 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8477601 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8477602 it has gone up transportation the stuff in paint has gone up thats just how it is
8477603 even though latex paints are water based most of the resins are derived from petroleum so whenever petroleum goes up fabrications of latex resins goes up
8477604 it costs probably 2 50 a gallon more now than it did a year ago some of the oils oil paint have gone up 5 a gallon
8477605 some of them are starting to create a separate materials list this is the labor cost for doing the painting work on your home and this is materials list
8477606 i dont think the prices will ever revert back to what they were
8477607 the ones who are holding back will eventually do some painting its just theyre holding off to make sure kids get back to school and they can fill the gas tank up to get to work theyll be painting wont be long theyll be at it again
8477608 in less than a decade weve gone from being perceived as being the beacon of democracy and justice all over the globe to a country whose government has little respect even for the most basic tenants of human rights
8477609 and our next president is going to inherit the most daunting set of foreign policy challenges since harry truman
8477610 together vice president cheney donald rumsfeld and john mccain brought more than a century of experience to our foreign policy challenges and what did that get us one international debacle after another
8477611 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8477612 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8477613 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8477614 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8477615 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8477616 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8477617 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8477618 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8477619 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8477620 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8477621 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8477622 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8477623 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8477624 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8477625 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8477626 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8477627 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8477628 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8477629 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8477630 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8477631 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8477632 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8477633 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

8477647 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8477648 reminded us what it was like when you have a president who actually puts people first
8477649 were going to open up this convention to make sure that everone who wants to come can join in this effort to take america back
8477650 i liked angelina til i heard her say she likes insane mccain for potus
8477651 i do not know brangelina and do not mean to personally impugn them as they might be good people in the flesh but the medias images of them are smelly and vile and i must always attack the medias representation of what is good or cool because those who inhabit the media world of glamour and entertainment and fashion and gossip are horrid people who have no talent of any kind and yet think of themselves as tastemakers taste my sandy buttcrack tmz and perez
8477652 now larry he was talking about roseanne he wasnt talking about every victim of child abuse

8477657 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8477658 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8477659 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8477660 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8477661 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8477662 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8477663 millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up
8477664 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8477665 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8477666 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8477667 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8477668 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8477669 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8477670 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8477671 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8477672 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8477673 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

8477679 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8477680 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8477681 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

8477695 while i dont believe that violent video games tend to have any negative effects on otherwise healthy people my job is to present any theory to a jury that would explain why my client did the things he did
8477696 an unsophisticated typically older somewhat more rural jury pool or judge to an extent the defendant is playing on the prejudices that these members of society already have towards video games the jury knows that a lot of kids today are playing this grand theft auto game and that its very violent or adult before we even walk into the courtroom

8477709 we support the open flow of information across the internet and a self regulating environment
8477710 the best way for us to find some amenable middle ground between airing opinions and being partial to community sensitivities we strongly urge the blogosphere to practise a commensurate amount of self moderation
8477711 whats unique about this program is that as researchers we are first gaining insight into the concerns and issues of these mothers and then enlisting them to help us come up with ways to increase the likelihood that they will try to breastfeed exclusively
8477712 this is much different from the usual route where the researchers come up with a solution beforehand and then conduct a study to see if it was correct
8477713 we are determined to make inroads and demonstrate real strategies that women can use
8477714 we know that breastfeeding works and that mothers and fathers want whats best for their babies our goal is to identify what a new mother needs for success and how that can be provided
8477715 allomap can help contribute to an appropriate treatment plan by identifying those patients not experiencing post operative heart transplant rejection
8477716 it is an example of how advancements in science and technology are leading to new medical care diagnostics
8477717 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them
8477718 relapse or the resumption of active drug taking and drug seeking is very common in drug addicts
8477719 addiction related brain changes and behaviors seem to be hardwired and semipermanent and there are limited treatment options our data suggest that rather than trying to block the process of increasing dendritic spine density we may actually want to look at treatments that try to enhance this process
8477720 this suggests the exciting possibility that mef2 proteins may control expression of key genes that modulate drug related brain changes and behavior
8477721 if we understand which genes are influenced by mef2 we can intervene and try to help the system resist or reverse these sensitization processes
8477722 these new findings have several clinical implications besides the impairment of sexual function in these young men
8477723 the lack of testosterone during these critical years may lead to diminished bone mass and the lack of development or lose of skeletal muscle in addition these patients may gain more weight with an average body mass index of 38 they already were obese and become more insulin resistant
8477724 also patients with low testosterone and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high concentrations of c reactive protein
8477725 which increases their risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease above and beyond the risk associated with diabetes
8477726 while obesity contributes to the association of type 2 diabetes and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism hh the association is not dependent entirely on obesity
8477727 in our first study of diabetic men we found that 31 percent of lean type 2 diabetics also had hh so it is likely that factors other than obesity contribute to hh possibly insulin resistance
8477728 whether obesity or insulin resistance is the major determinant of hh has to be addressed in future studies and the pathogenesis of hh needs to be defined
8477729 look i do not have time for this crap i am going to open the gate to the back yard i am going to leave the back door open i am going to go back out of the front door and will be back in here in two minutes i expect you to be gone i also expect you to take anything you have up there with you out of the back door and out of the yard
8477730 i dont have time to figure out who you are and what you are up to
8477731 if you are still up there when i get back we are going to have serious issues and the police will be called and you will be prosecuted for trespassing guaranteed
8477732 i have done it before and i will do it again if i see you outside game on get out of the back door disappear and do not let me see you
8477733 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8477734 and it shows just how high these clouds really are at the very edge of space
8477735 nlcs are made of tiny ice crystals 40 to 100 nanometers wide just the right size to scatter blue wavelengths of sunlight this was known before aim the spacecraft has detected another population of much smaller ice crystals
8477736 we believe that more time in orbit and more data are going to help us answer these questions
8477737 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8477738 the statistical evidence for inclination is very good it might play a role
8477739 inclination is a good match to the data and eccentricity really isnt
8477740 i dont think thats the best way to look at it
8477741 we must find a physical process that will convince me that the inclination is the key factor in creating the 100 000 year cycle the only answer for me is the physical mechanism
8477742 i have to confess i dont have a physical mechanism that works
8477743 but part of the problem is our ignorance of the atmosphere and the dust in the nearby solar system
8477744 is that if you look carefully at the milankovitch model the physical mechanism there was always hand waving too
8477745 even though you cant pin down exactly why earths climate responds to milankovitch orbital cycles at least there is some physical connection whereas rich muller has none
8477746 it would be hard to believe this tiny influx of dust could be having such a profound effect on climate
8477747 hey good to see you are you helping out in the bookstore today

8477780 i at midnight by the clock may creep into your bed
8477781 we would try and fit people in where we could and try to help people
8477782 however if it were to happen this would be a real disaster which people have never really considered before now
8477783 if something does happen it will be up to the government to step in
8477784 we have never had so many people wanting places for their children
8477785 i dont think the abc centres will close i think its more likely that they will be sold off
8477786 when the abc share price dropped earlier in the year we had a lot of inquires
8477787 however most parents come to us because they want to pay less or would like a change of care
8477788 the same week that abc raised its fees we had a lot of people wanting to enrol their children here
8477789 voting against the bill wouldnt make me or anyone else overly popular in the opposition and is probably to the detriment of any possibility of a ministerial position if we win government at the next election but sometimes you have to vote the way you believe and in this instance i am completely against the sale
8477790 when i crossed the floor last time i did so for very personal reasons and the party understood that this one could be different if the coalition did choose to support the bill
8477791 the reports we have been given still do not answer many of the questions that i have about the effect of privatisation on regional cities like orange
8477792 there is no cost blowout on this project as reported to council this project consists of a number of major components of work which will be competitively tendered for and until this process is completed the actual final cost of the work is unknown
8477793 this the cost blow out allegation is extremely unfortunate as the staff involved in this project are working extremely hard to deliver this very complex project and allegations of this nature are particularly unhelpful
8477794 weve taken a unit of work and linked it all together
8477795 our aim is to make it make fun engaging and educational

8477801 the gwahs has received issues of concern about the workload of nurses raised by the nsw nurses association
8477802 in response gwahs is undertaking an internal review of the workload of nurses at orange health service
8477803 we want to make it quite clear that the nurses did not initiate this issue over workloads
8477804 another major concern for nurses is that if a decision is made to open up the surge beds the hospital will have difficulty finding staff at short notice

8477877 this is the most important mortgage market reform bill the legislature has sent to the governor

8477896 i wanted to find some continuity and when i first talked to atkins about it i told him the reasons behind it
8477897 i feel all right it took a few games to get used to it again
8477898 we wanted to challenge other young players and i thought the best thing for the team was to move him to first and bring stewart up to give him a volume of games at third its all made a lot of sense
8477899 the big difference for me was transitioning being aggressive at third to being more of a receiver at first
8477900 it made sense to him to do what was best for the team now we have two point people who play every day

8477925 overall there was no difference in the two groups people taking telmisartan and those taking placebo

8477927 these effects have not been seen early after a stroke they may be more delayed
8477928 the follow up time in this study was only two a half years and it may have hurt us
8477929 but this study in itself doesnt say you have to use angiotensin ii receptor blocker early
8477930 other studies have suggested that these drugs may be better for stroke risk reduction but in this study we cant say that
8477931 this represents a major step forward in our understanding of the dry form of macular degeneration
8477932 and with the identification of this potential target we can try to develop treatments for a disease which for the moment we cant treat
8477933 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8477934 the addition of bortezomib velcade resulted in significant prolongation in time to disease progression with a reduction of 52 percent in risk of progression
8477935 there was also a significant prolongation of survival with a 40 percent reduction in the risk of death
8477936 the main factors that could determine the actual inflation rate for the month are the impact of the onset of the typhoon season and rising costs of raw materials for production of certain food items which could be balanced off by lower international rice and oil prices

8477948 i was standing up for my free speech rights showing support for a fellow activist

8477958 yo no entiendo por qu el presidente de onefa hace comentarios negativos sobre la liga por eso es necesario que en un futuro exista una especie de comisionado que tome las decisiones para beneficio y no para perjuicio del futbol americano de nuestro pa s
8477959 el paso county officials like scores of state politicians have dealt with revenue shortfalls of late by immediately pleading with the public for more tax money
8477960 the ballot measures empower the electorate aka the people instead of city bureaucracy to make the decisions its easy to understand how city officials could oppose proposed changes to revenue streams its hard to understand why any public servant would oppose letting the public decide
8477961 i just feel like i deserve it more than the others
8477962 mccain sought to kill e rate then turned around and took credit for it he opposed it didnt want it to happen he would bully government agencies
8477963 i know the kid knows he has problems so i dont know why he would do that
8477964 i was really mad that someone would be that cruel and put it on a computer
8477965 you can see in the videotape where hes not realizing quite whats going to happen to him because hes standing there and hes smiling
8477966 the kid just walked up to him and you see my brother backing up in the video
8477967 in the 1980s and 90s playing video games was fun for kids
8477968 now we have kids seeking their thrills by being aggressive posting it on the internet and showing everyone how cool they are in doing these sorts of things
8477969 first it was bad enough that they did it then they videotaped it then they made it into a joke they did it in slow motion and they replayed it frame by frame
8477970 it hurts my feelings so bad it hurts my heart
8477971 there is a positive youthful energy in the vancouver and winnipeg markets and we have sought to capture this in our branding
8477972 im not for counting the number of faeries that can dance on the head of a pin im simply looking for a set of beliefs which include a supreme being a code that is simple to understand though not simple to abide by

8477974 in our tradition celebration of life is more important than mourning over the dead when a wedding procession encounters a funeral procession in the street the mourners must halt so as to allow the wedding party to proceed surely you know what respect we show our dead but a wedding a symbol of life and renewal a symbol of promise too takes precedence
8477975 the breaking of the glass now has many interpretations one of which says that even in the moment of our greatest joy we should remember that there is still pain and suffering in the world and that we have a responsibility to help relieve that pain and suffering
8477976 this is the first anticyclone to visit new zealand since mid july said metservice weather ambassador bob mcdavitt

8477978 so how can give us a shot or not isnt timbre seen as an avid supporter of local bands
8477979 the performance was all right i liked the song choices the audience based on what i saw was reasonably responsive i am guessing the repertoire of the band is more suited to an expat crowd who likes the soul funky numbers musically the band was not bad and although mistakes made through nervousness are common they cannot be ignored if the band worked on the overall sounds and dynamics it would have been better the repertoire is probably more suited to timbre the arts house which caters more for a mature audience but we will not hire the band at the moment as there needs to be improvement in the different areas mentioned
8477980 making about s 4 000 or s 5 000 monthly
8477981 the success of the band was irrelevant sure we could have been famous and made albums and stuff but that would have been predictable this way its poetry
8477982 ive started a new project its big its like look at our line up and imagine something even bigger kind of big im directing it myself i cant mention it publicly yet when you find out what this is youll likely agree that i cant oversell this one

8478214 either quote a low price or not even talk about pricing up front theyll put the asphalt down and then raise the price substantially
8478215 i think theres a strong argument for saying that more of the training which occurs can be done in regional and country areas where theres less population and where there are valuable job opportunities
8478216 theoretically it should be impossible for two planes to collide so theres obviously been a failure a serious failure somewhere in the system but im advised that training there has been undertaken for many many years with a good safety record
8478217 i think one of the things that we would like to see over time is more of this sort of training undertaken in less densely populated areas and i suspect thats one of the things that may come out of the reports
8478218 its one of the busiest airports in australia i think there are something like 500 000 air movements there each year
8478219 its also im advised one of the safest but obviously we want to ensure that the airports are as safe as possible
8478220 obviously yesterday was a tragic accident and tragic for the family concerned but it could have been worse
8478221 we are grateful for the fact no schools or occupied houses were affected but we will look very closely at the report of the coroner and casa
8478222 we want to look back to where the accident happened to see where the bits flew down
8478223 the reason we are here at the crash site today is to see if there was anything wrong with the aircraft prior to the accident
8478224 the pilot had more than 250 hours experience before he became an instructor
8478225 there are problems and they are mostly to do with accent
8478226 i was a little skeptical about the subject the fly i said well how is it going to be reading for an opera but it just takes somebody that has the experience of composer howard shore to write the music and he has done a score that goes fabulously well with the story
8478227 working with two great artists like placido domingo and david cronenberg its just been a fantastic experience
8478228 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas
8478229 we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas
8478230 what they show is the areas where gps are picking this up and taking it most seriously
8478231 this capability is a crucial first step in defining translational therapies to ameliorate the effects of inner ear disease in humans
8478232 although still a long way from the clinic the work shows that gene therapy is a potential treatment to combat some forms of congenital deafness
8478233 with one in 2 000 children born deaf because of genetic defects such a therapy would clearly be of value
8478234 this is an exciting development which completes another important piece of the jig saw in understanding how we might use gene therapy to eventually restore hearing loss
8478235 one of the advantages of our method is that it takes into account both people and places
8478236 for instance with unemployment we can say that people who are unemployed are on average happier in an area of high unemployment compared to being unemployed in an area where everyone else around you has a job
8478237 from what ive seen so far my view is that if an area is more socially cohesive it increases your chances of having good quality of interpersonal relationships and a good social network
8478238 if you live in an area which is very unequal and polarised then you are less likely to have good social networks and friends
8478239 to what extent we can talk about happy people or happy places is it the place or the people my guess would be its a bit of both
8478240 the variance that is attributed to the place you live in is perhaps higher than our research suggests your immediate surroundings are very important in terms of happiness

8478246 prime minister manning has asked president venetiaan to study the agreement but no deadline were set when the suriname government should announce its position
8478247 at this point in time i am not ready to support the initiative for a political integration with other nations
8478248 currently we are involved in the economic integration within caricom and with a political integration you will lose some of your sovereignty and im of the opinion that we should study this very carefully while a strong and wide popular support should be necessary since this issue doesnt concern only the government
8478249 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything in her power to elect barack obama that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us
8478250 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8478251 hemingway loved cuba because it was a place where he could be anonymous
8478252 somewhere he could live and write without being interfered with and bombarded for autographs
8478253 he seemed to have understood people and situations in a way that very few writers have
8478254 but obviously cuba is in far better condition than the last payments crisis in 2002
8478255 some of the main investment projects have been reduced and further reductions will be necessary
8478256 the 158 000 barrels of oil per day that we consumed last year cost 8 7 million per day and this year costs 32 percent more or 11 6 million per day
8478257 we will not know for sure until tomorrow and once we do we will announce it to the public the two matches today are going ahead and the dcc group c matches will continue in the cayman islands as soon as we can confirm dates it really does depend on gustavs movements
8478258 we have been preparing for these matches since the end of last year and are very excited about playing in the digicel caribbean championships gustav will not dampen our spirits
8478259 the players are prepared and have committed themselves to the games we have a great opportunity here especially to redeem ourselves against bermuda who beat us 3 1 in the world cup qualifiers we are eager to settle the score
8478260 i have never seen a sense of urgency like this i have never seen my country as energized as this
8478261 as our next president has said from places where people hurt to places where people dream our time is now
8478262 the time has come for a president who has lived the american dream who is on our side
8478263 this is the first national convention ive ever wanted to go to for exactly that reason
8478264 less than 50 years after dr king marched on washington for basic civil rights a party of our country has nominated an african american to be our leader and it is because of as dr king said the content of his character and not the color of his skin
8478265 it is my distinct honor as an iraq war veteran and as a life long republican to nominate the next president of the united states of america barack obama
8478266 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8478267 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8478268 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8478269 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8478270 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out

8478273 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states

8478275 the clinton and obama camps orchestrated a roll call that pleased most everyone upset almost no one and provided an historic moment for the nightly newscasts
8478276 it was another attempt by the party to show a united front coming out of this convention something that looks more possible by the day
8478277 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8478278 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country

8478306 we dont know if thats going to increase the danger to these kids
8478307 we do know that the concern is with the numbers we are seeing with the demands we are seeing
8478308 if we can avoid it avoid as long as we can to not disrupt the bond between child and parent
8478309 i would move cautiously with this i would not make it too easily available
8478310 if we can become a gracious society this place will be really worth living in

8478312 as an organization we are thrilled to make this announcement and honored that debbie has given so much of herself to this agency
8478313 we are making more matches between children and adult volunteers because of her ability to connect with parents and children
8478314 she is an asset to this organization and her dedication to the program mission is evident on a daily basis
8478315 she is often here early and is willing to work late to accommodate schedules of the families we serve she is a team player and always offering to help others when they become overwhelmed with their caseload or current project

8478337 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8478338 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8478339 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8478340 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8478341 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8478342 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8478343 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8478344 but what really incensed me was when i was told i could not change it back to lloyds is pants because they said it was not appropriate
8478345 i asked if it was pants they didnt like and would lloyds is rubbish do but they didnt think so
8478346 so i tried barclays is better and that didnt go down too well either
8478347 the rules seemed to change and they told me it had to be one word so i tried censorship but they didnt like that and then said it had to be no more than six letters long
8478348 it is very disappointing that he felt the need to express his upset with our service in this way
8478349 i never write the yankees off until the seasons over and the standings are set
8478350 theyve been around too long and been in the playoffs for such a long time that were definitely not counting them out
8478351 it couldnt have been any worse the first two games but weve got to come back tomorrow
8478352 when i walked into this clubhouse i remembered getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away and i got a smile on my face because it just has a good memory to me
8478353 and i know this is the last year of the stadium so you think about that
8478354 two games doesnt make a lifetime it doesnt make a career
8478355 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankee series for me
8478356 im not writing a hall of fame career just yet but its been nice to get off to the start ive gotten off to it takes a little bit of pressure off
8478357 hes a beauty hes kind of i think the energizer bunny for this team
8478358 you know hes the one that stirs stuff up every team has got to have that guy
8478359 the seasons getting shorter we dont have many games left
8478360 we really have to come out and be perfect tomorrow
8478361 this was a huge huge win for us simply because of the way we lost last night
8478362 we couldve afforded to lose but the way we lost last night you never know where thats going to lead you
8478363 you always want to see the big league team do well
8478364 it was a team effort its not about one guy or one pitcher we did a great job
8478365 i think the race will come down to the end
8478366 this was a huge huge win for us simply because of the way we lost last night
8478367 we couldve afforded to lose but the way we lost last night you never know where thats going to lead you
8478368 you always want to see the big league team do well
8478369 it was a team effort its not about one guy or one pitcher we did a great job
8478370 i think the race will come down to the end
8478371 it is true that currently investor interest is moving towards commodity consuming countries rather than those which export them also there is unwinding of position in commodities as the dollar is rising
8478372 currently funds are betting big on a dollar rise and taking positions in equity which is benefited by it this is the chief reason why the indian markets are holding firm even while the other markets are falling as india is not a commodity exporting country
8478373 for he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight in love he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through jesus christ in accordance with his pleasure and will in him we were also chosen having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will
8478374 in love he predestined us to the praise of his glorious grace
8478375 for those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and those whom he predestined he also called and those whom he called he also justified and those whom he justified he also glorified
8478376 you have come to know god or rather to be known by him
8478377 oh look israel rejects jesus so god is forced to abrogate his promises to israel and to set up a new covenant with a new people who will take him
8478378 paul could have said i am glad you made that protest because it indicates that you mistook my meaning
8478379 by no means for he says i will have mercy on whom i have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i have compassion
8478380 is completely false our camp never approached the obama camp the obama and clinton camps were calling our office before the puerto rican primary trying to get yankee to endorse them the mccain camp approached us as well
8478381 tide point phase 2 on the baltimore development corporation bdc website
8478382 were here to nominate a candidate for could you imagine what would happen if something happened and the police werent here
8478383 one on hand its very reassuring in terms of knowing that when we need a police presence its there
8478384 so for example if there were to be riots in town or god forbid a terrorist attack or other things that are security related its kind of like our own version of
8478385 if theres anything on the negative side its kind of the sense of hummm we have all these bigwigs in town where were you when i needed you
8478386 is it supposed to make us feel safe but it doesnt
8478387 its a small price to pay for hosting a tremendously big important event that is the center of the worlds attention
8478388 going to conjure the image of the city being one step away from a fascist state
8478389 you have to prepare for the worst and breathe a sigh of relief if in fact in looks like you were overstaffed
8478390 i think it reflects that this is a city prepared for the worst and that were here to protect both the visitors and the citizens
8478391 part of the problem is wanting to get this done quickly and painlessly
8478392 a nurse or physicians assistant can sign off and thats a mistake thats got to be stopped in new jersey
8478393 these disorders can be very disabling but since you cant see them like a broken bone or tumor they are easily missed
8478394 part of the problem is wanting to get this done quickly and painlessly
8478395 a nurse or physicians assistant can sign off and thats a mistake thats got to be stopped in new jersey
8478396 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8478397 it also means that climate warming is coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8478398 the audi brand is on a role with the launch of the entirely new a4 audi is building off of the successful r8 and a5 launches
8478399 the a4 is quicker more fuel efficient and roomier than the competition this campaign delivers that message in a clear and dramatic fashion we simply reported the facts in an engaging fashion were no longer content to be among the leaders in luxury we want to be the leader bold and dynamic products will lead the way

8478420 mal sehen auf dem kanapee will ich jedenfalls nicht faulenzen
8478421 es ist eine lustige idee leute dazu anzuhalten ihren abfall nicht einfach fallen zu lassen
8478422 i hope that as the people of the caribbean look at this beautiful culture here that it would help them
8478423 we live in a world that has misrepresented islam and we must speak up in defence of islam
8478424 sometimes you go to a rainforest and see nothing but trees and ants and its a bit dull in guyana you genuinely do see a high concentration of wildlife
8478425 you dont see anyone arrested you dont see an active effort against corruption
8478426 venezuela has an air force it has radar it has a trained military

8478429 if he had continued the slowest he would have run would have been 9 52
8478430 this is his first year of running the 100 meters
8478431 in two more years he should be peaking at this distance and by then i am certain he will be down to there
8478432 ive had some sleep since ive been here so im not tired im trying to get my blood pumping again
8478433 a very challenging year for trinidad and tobago with respect to dengue
8478434 having access to the trinidad and tobago treasury but of course that was an unspoken word according to a former minister
8478435 we urge you further to make every effort to ensure that a common position is adopted with respect to its signing in order to preserve the essential founding principle of unity which has served our countries so well in foreign policy over the years
8478436 we look forward to the adjustment of this agreement for the benefit of all people of our region
8478437 we have not much but we have our human beings human capital that commitment to solidarity in the war is the central cuban foreign policy to provide assistant to sister nations
8478438 i am very proud of serving belize with two cuban presidents fidel castro and his brother raul i am confident that the experience of both the new cuban leaders keeps the path of the cuban revolution towards the future
8478439 i hope that one of these days some of our writers might be encouraged to do some writing about the past legislators especially because it was not a source of income for them it was trying to help the people
8478440 captured in each individual pixel of these stamps is a progressive history of the bvi and our evolution each pixel represents all those who have given themselves to this great country
8478441 i feel very optimistic about how well we are being received how well the mix of cultural expressions that we have brought into guyana is going to make an impact
8478442 as to be expected we had our own problems internally that would be tied with moving over 120 people from one country to the next
8478443 our container did not arrive so had to resort to delivery by dhl for some of our items so some of the items we had intended to present in guyana are not in guyana so we had to improvise in that respect
8478444 then we had issues with some of the venues in terms of equipment and so forth so there were one or two performances who had to be canceled because the proper equipment was not in place
8478445 it really created excitement amongst the rest of the caribbean community in attendance in terms of seeing our overall presentations as we move along
8478446 it calls for some of our bahamian performers to drive long distances to perform
8478447 it think all that builds to the spirit of carifesta really because it is not just all about performing it is all about a learning experience a cross cultural connection to be able to make sure that your artists not only perform but also get real exposure to different aspects of what the caribbean diaspora is all about
8478448 i think that guyana is an excellent venue for carifesta and for the bahamas to match it in 2010 we would definitely have to utilise our family islands as well as new providence
8478449 new providence just would not be big enough to make the kind of impression that would need to be made
8478450 if we want to transport people from one island to the next it has to be feasible
8478451 its going to call for us to have corporate partners like the airline industry like the sealift industry on board to make sure that we can get some of these things done within the budget of the whole hosting of carifesta
8478452 people are always blaming their circumstances for what they are i dont believe in circumstances the people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want and if they cant find them they create them

8478454 represents purports to represent or could reasonably be perceived as representing the west indies
8478455 regrettably both the wicb and stanford have consistently denied that digicel has any rights or entitlements as the team that will play england has nothing whatsoever to do with the west indies
8478456 as a result of the strike the ministry of labour intervened and the parties agreed to conciliation
8478457 the chief labour occupational safety officer met with the parties on three occasions deadlock was declared on august 25 2008 after both parties held firm to their positions
8478458 as a consequence of the severe negative impact and costs that the strikes would have on the economy and being satisfied that the continuance of the difference is likely to be gravely injurious to the national interest the minister has today caused the chief labour occupational safety officer to write both the union and the corporation that he will be referring the dispute to compulsory arbitration by the virtue of the powers vested in him under by section
8478459 when will you give yourself permission to be angry about the abuse

8478491 la ley se est aplicando bastante bien y se est n recuperando muchos restos de fosas comunes y tambi n van desapareciendo de pueblos y ciudades algunos s mbolos de la dictadura que no se hab an retirado a n
8478492 no se trata de remover las cosas para sacar beneficio pol tico alguno lo que la ley pretende es reparar la dignidad que se les arrebat durante la guerra y despu s de que terminara y no hay que olvidar que tambi n tiene en cuenta a las v ctimas que se produjeron en territorio republicano
8478493 es en los lugares donde todo el mundo se conoce donde las cosas son m s dif ciles
8478494 pero seguramente es all donde es m s necesaria la ley ha habido gente viviendo durante a os con el inmenso peso de haber padecido c rcel por condenas injustas o simplemente no han podido honrar a unas v ctimas de las que ni siquiera sab an d nde hab an sido enterradas
8478495 era importante hacer una ley porque la dotaci n econ mica que la acompa a es imprescindible para poner en marcha las iniciativas necesarias para que esa ley se cumpla pero adem s era ya hora de que de manera oficial quedara establecido que se cometieron muchas injusticias que no fueron leg timos muchos juicios que sin garant as de ning n tipo se hicieron durante la dictadura que la represi n fue arbitraria y brutal
8478496 el caso espa ol fue sobre todo distinto porque la transici n tuvo lugar mucho despu s de que se produjeran los peores excesos del franquismo hab a entonces un deseo muy fuerte de que jam s se volviera a repetir el clima de violencia que desat la guerra y por tanto hubo una voluntad generalizada de limar asperezas no escarbar demasiado y mirar hacia adelante pero la transici n no es intocable y me parece leg timo que ahora se la pueda criticar y empezar a ocuparse de las cosas que dej sin hacer una de ellas fue la reparaci n de las v ctimas

8478596 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn the quality of his heart
8478597 i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8478598 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8478599 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
8478600 she got us stuck on three different issues that we wanted no part of shes no master strategist no matter what she may believe you may see more of her but if her mouth is open what comes out wont be anything that our campaign wants anything to do with
8478601 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view
8478602 according to several house democrat leadership staffers pelosi grew increasingly angry several months ago that she was not being given a strategic role in directing the democrat convention or being actively sought out by the obama campaign for advice
8478603 she made a point that she was queen of the far left which was the group that really helped obama get to where he was
8478604 she didnt call herself a queen but you get the point and so did the obama people
8478605 if you never have an unscheduled downtime you are either lying or you do not have any users
8478606 all that we are is a result of what we have thought
8478607 what this power is i cannot say all i know is that it exists
8478608 imagination is everything it is the preview of lifes coming attractions
8478609 whatever the mind of man can conceive it can achieve
8478610 at that time there were no schools for girls of the indian community moreover the orthodox society abstained from sending girls to schools imagine hemlata sarkar going from door to door approaching parents and explaining the importance of equality for women
8478611 it is said that in those days the native women always had to cover their head
8478612 in 1909 the school was shifted to oak lodge on a monthly rent of rs 150 in the 1930s it was again shifted to the current premises near the railway station with the help of three maharanis suniti devi from cooch behar sucharu devi from mayurbhanj orissa and radharani devi of burdwan
8478613 we are not sure of the dates but satyajit ray had studied in the primary section of the school which is co educational historian swapna das and economist arun kumar maitra also appear to have studied here
8478614 his aunt leela majumdar taught at the school and it is possible that ray had visited the institution during vacations
8478615 we have heard that some other group has also got in touch with them the alumni but sadly no one has come to the school to help us with the celebrations
8478616 however now we have decided to organise only a two day celebration from that day we are hopeful that we can organise something grand before the centenary year ends next year
8478617 we held a raffle draw but with the current political situation in the hills where the gorkhaland demand has been revived it was not much of a success it is the teachers and the children who have made up the entire contribution for the celebrations
8478618 there is no proper drinking water facility in our school and our infrastructure is crumbling we have reached a milestone but we still have miles to go
8478619 however no instruction has reached us about taking similar steps in the hills
8478620 i was on my way to sukna when some morcha supporters intercepted me
8478621 they did not pay any attention to our requests and put black paint on the front and rear number plates saying vehicles with wb registrations would not be allowed to enter the hills
8478622 there was a tension as the number plates of a vehicle had been painted black a complaint has been received and we are looking into it
8478623 today we closed our office offering gl registration to car owners who wanted it and assembled at the mirik more stopping vehicles carrying wb number plates and painting them in black in protest
8478624 so far we have painted the number plates of at least 70 vehicles mostly coming from siliguri
8478625 now if anybody wishes to obtain gl registration they can get it only from the morcha central committee
8478626 we want immediate administrative steps against the morcha supporters for forcibly blackening number plates and charging money for the so called gl registration
8478627 unless there is a change in the situation none of our members will take their vehicles to the hills as they feel insecure
8478628 all the police stations in siliguri have been instructed to impound vehicles featuring gl number plates and arrest the persons including the driver of such vehicles stern action would also be taken if anyone tries to tar the west bengal number plates here
8478629 that the bridge has been damaged within two years of its construction proves that the material used was of poor quality we had repeatedly told the authorities that the work was not being carried out properly but they did nothing
8478630 our children will not be able to go to school and colleges because of the absence of bus service
8478631 because of erosion the bhandari and the basra are now flowing just 100 metres apart and if they come together a major portion of kalchini as well as alipurduar will be flooded
8478632 the cbdt directive has created anguish and confusion among the people
8478633 we have to educate the tax payers and prepare them mentally about the new system of taxation
8478634 we have requested the finance minister for arranging seminars in the state for the tax payers the tax should be assessed from april 1 2009
8478635 we demand that these families be exempted from paying taxes like their sikkimese brethren an assurance that the chief minister has given us several times
8478636 hi sir i would like to complain about one of your police officer who have assaulted me at the cafe
8478637 you are telling me that you are batman the son of superman
8478638 governments only get one opportunity to sell a publicasset and if they decide to sell its essential thattaxpayers get the best possible price

8478644 while we have to start over in the process most of the folks have heard about it so i dont think that it will have a difficult time
8478645 it has been my experience that a great number of criminals do know what the law says about things
8478646 if there is extra consideration given to the protection of the elderly then yeah they might shy away from attacking the older person
8478647 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8478648 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8478649 for every goal there must be a purpose the higher the purpose the more likely you will achieve it

8478658 theyll have one of the best 1 2 punches in the league oneal can muscle up against some of the bigger opposing forwards and centers while bosh can use his speed and versatility to leak out on guys that are stretching out towards the perimeter or stick down to come from the weak side with some help d and a big block for oneal they should compliment each other well as two big men with different defensive styles and strengths
8478659 its not fair to put a number on the team yet i mean were still a month away from training camp and 6 weeks from their first pre season game two months from the regular season on paper i dont see why they cant be a top 5 team in the east
8478660 a commitment to driving to the hoop and using his athleticism and a refocus on the defensive tenacity he brought during his first couple of months as well i think his jumper got better as the season went on and was very impressed with his rebounding throughout the year if he can continue to add to those components hell be a valuable piece for the raps

8478677 and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship in the breaking of bread and in prayers then fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles now all who believed were together and had all things in common and sold their possessions and goods and divided them among all as anyone had need so continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart praising god and having favour with all the people and the lord added to the church daily those who were being saved
8478678 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8478679 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8478680 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8478681 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8478682 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8478683 the only question is whether we take a page from the

8478690 about five masked men armed with pistols came to our camp they ordered us to get into our make shift houses and then after a few minutes we heard shots when we came out three of our men were lying there
8478691 we do not know why our colleagues were targeted but we suspect it is because they were active in the recent protests against the killings of the aid workers someone wants to silence us we do not know who
8478692 ready to lead and vowed to do everything he could to make sure obama wins the white house in november
8478693 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama clinton 62 said tonight in denver
8478694 barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are first strong at home clinton said
8478695 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8478696 good man who served heroically in the vietnam war clinton said he was wrong on
8478697 everything i learned in my eight years as president and the in work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8478698 too young and too inexperienced to be the nations commander in chief
8478699 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history clinton said
8478700 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8478702 got so frustrated i just gave up for a couple days and
8478703 we probably would have practiced outside saturday monday and tuesday and practiced inside today and tomorrow because we are playing inside and it would have lent itself to recovery
8478704 we can practice everything indoors but its does inhibit us a little bit from a specialty standpoint in terms of catching punts catching kickoffs and getting the timing down in the kicking game so the primary reason for going outside today was so that we could practice and improve the kicking game we practiced a lot of situations in the kicking game
8478705 100 percent yet and might be a week or two away
8478706 clemson has great skill players on offense quarterback cullen harper is a really good player the two running backs that they have i am sure everybody knows are fantastic and may be the best running back combination in the country aaron kelly is a fantastic receiver their defense probably goes unnoticed in a lot of ways they were in the top 10 in the country in scoring defense and total defense last year and they were in the top 10 in turnover margin they really have good defensive players and those defensive players spill over on special teams to some degree with spiller and ford being great speed guys on special teams this is an outstanding team tommy bowden has done a fantastic job
8478707 well that was the opportunity that we had and philosophically last year we played florida state at a neutral site jacksonville fla
8478708 as a team we believe that this contract is ratifiable
8478709 the more money we have the better our recruiting opportunities are for the district as well as helping to retain teachers in the school district
8478710 if we dont have a good contract and if were not able to keep teachers satisfied then theyre going to go elsewhere to find employment
8478711 when teachers look at topeka public schools and see that when you combine the salary and the benefits being paid that were the highest in shawnee county
8478712 that certainly is a plus for us when it comes to the recruitment of teachers
8478713 oh nothing just picking up some groceries what are you doing
8478714 are we stopping because if so i refuse to sit in my stroller

8478721 had issues with crying last year most likely has autism sometimes its hard to get him to focus
8478722 if you raise your hand and the teacher doesnt call on you thats okay
8478723 it was two against one you know and no one helped him
8478724 i didnt think that it would happen but it was not safe for him to work there
8478725 we also know through 75 years of experience that federal correctional facilities are managed most effectively through frequent and direct communication with inmates
8478726 i dont think that will diminish their communication at all
8478727 every single inmate in there is armed to the teeth for his own protection
8478728 i am not bruce lee so i cant take on 110 inmates by myself every day it is like david vs goliath you are taking on the world by yourself
8478729 the homicide rates among the inmate populations are at the highest levels theyve ever been in the history of the bureau of prisons
8478730 the assaults on staff whether weapons or no weapons has intensified
8478731 the safety and security of our staff continues to be the highest priority of the bureau of prisons
8478732 the population is just too unpredictable and you never know if they are going to turn on you or not
8478733 affordable web design should never mean cheap it simply refers to delivering great value for money without compromising business reputation or performance
8478734 from a pragmatic point of view the difference between living against a background of foreignness and one of intimacy means the difference between a general habit of wariness and one of trust
8478735 we were not expecting that their website be in braille or that they make any huge changes just that they designed the site in a standard way so our software would work
8478736 lots of other large corporation websites have dealt with this successfully
8478737 they did not want to talk to us about it
8478738 in 2006 many things on the website were accessible to visually impaired people and some were not
8478739 whats important is that we have been working continuously as the website and the technology have improved
8478740 target has made a positive shift to dealing with the problem
8478741 its been a hard days night and ive been working like a dog
8478742 they were investigating through their usual means of just trying to glean out what is truth and what is fiction
8478743 obviously i have a desire to know whats going on and i was astounded that the minister didnt have more detail
8478744 what im being told from the shop floor is around the end of june that they were told there was a security breach potential escape happening in that area and some time after that they reduced the security level back again

8478751 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8478752 daddy used to spend a lot of time with you guys huh
8478753 how bout making snowmen our leaf piles do you remember that
8478754 she was kind of confused at first if she saw a soldier she would ask is that my daddy and id have to explain to her that it wasnt
8478755 i didnt believe in the war at all but i believed in my son
8478756 ive talked to people who are more worried about the price of gas than they are the soldiers in afghanistan and iraq and thats sad
8478757 i think that our soldiers did their jobs there they did a wonderful job there and now its time for the people in iraq to start rebuilding their country and to live as a free people
8478758 i would like to see the war come to an end but id like it to be done the right way to put a lot of thought into it and figure out how to do it without because i dont want all the soldiers to have died for nothing because somebody decides to pull out of the war
8478759 when i talk to the girls i always tell them daddy did it so that you can sleep safe at night and to help other children over in iraq to be just like you guys be able to catch frogs and play and be safe
8478760 think twice before you send any more soldiers into war
8478761 darren if i read things correctly codeigniter grew out of expressionengine as
8478762 expression engine sounds like a gui for using codeigniter to create
8478763 seems like the idea of the framework that could generate custom cmss occurred to

8478770 tidak percaya bawa kemari dua budak itu penggal yang itu satunya lagi bebaskan
8478771 it is really hard to get your head around the fact that when your child goes on an excursion they need to have a permission slip signed by the parent but the school is within its rights to take a child to the doctor to be put on the pill
8478772 the schools first action in these situations is always to encourage the student to talk it through with parents
8478773 where this is not possible or the student refuses to do so and the student is deemed at serious risk the wellbeing coordinators are obliged to assist the student in seeking medical advice
8478774 it is the general practitioner who decides what is best for the student and the course of action not the school
8478775 the problems that underlie these student health issues are very complex this means that application of the privacy regulations can at times be seen as at odds with parents
8478776 we need to look at why kids feel they cannot talk about this with their parents
8478777 i she had and the parents refused to give her the pill its not necessarily going to stop her having sex
8478778 i worry more about the kids at this age who are having sex and not seeking contraception
8478779 i was teenager once and id rather you be on the pill then get pregnant i thank her for that because there were some girls who did actually fall pregnant

8478782 affordable web design should never mean cheap it simply refers to delivering great value for money without compromising business reputation or performance
8478783 that seems pretty unlikely especially if this is an inmate in labor
8478784 when you boil this situation down from a correction standpoint its not about immigration and its not about us
8478785 its about how do we ensure that a person is going to be able to go through that experience and be sensitive to that experience and attend to our duty it is my opinion that we were doing a little more than may have been necessary in every case
8478786 affordable web design should never mean cheap it simply refers to delivering great value for money without compromising business reputation or performance
8478787 ability to lead manage and direct the activities of this agency
8478788 has treated all employees fairly he has done an outstanding job and we are very pleased with the improvements he has made at the jail

8478790 it is appropriate given abramoffs extraordinary cooperation to date cooperation which can be wholly or partially credited for the convictions of a member of congress five high level legislative branch officials one high level executive branch official and two other mid to low level public officials

8478792 im not fit to catch up another piece of cloth and that was like
8478793 coasts clear jingles started doing the hiring at the present and to let

8478796 actually they could liquid being ignited through a wick is technology that hasnt changed much over the centuries go back to school kid maybe that choice to toke instead of study wasnt such a good idea
8478797 you were convicted in my opinion on the clearest and most compelling evidence as a result of going to trial the two girls were required to give evidence

8478801 when it was shown to him he was very very pleased indeed mr adcock said today
8478802 he could only widen his eyes or something like that but it was explained to him and he was thrilled
8478803 it probably did as much as the injections they were giving him
8478804 doctors dont usually make predictions but they are predicting that within three days they will be able to feed him solids and that should build up his strength

8478806 mr glenn on the occasion of the opening of the business school in february said to me pretty much what he said to the privileges committee
8478807 he mr glenn stated his view then that he had contributed money whether it was to new zealand first or to some other fund thats lost in the mists of time but as i say at every time that this issue has arisen i have rung mr peters and asked for his word
8478808 recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of eukaryotic genes are mispredicted at the transcript level as the mispred routines are able to detect many of these errors and may aid in their correction we suggest that it may significantly improve the quality of protein sequence data based on gene predictions
8478809 some secreted proteins may truly lack secretory signal peptides since they are subject to leaderless protein secretion similarly it cannot be excluded at present that transchromosomal chimeras can be formed and may have normal physiological functions nevertheless the fact that mispred analyses of protein sequences of the swiss prot database identified very few such exceptions indicates that the rules of mispred are generally valid
8478810 interestingly even the manually curated uniprotkb swiss prot dataset is contaminated with mispredicted or abnormal proteins although to a much lesser extent than uniprotkb trembl or the ensembl or gnomon predicted entries
8478811 other researchers have suggested in the past that nk cells might not always be good for you but we now have the first direct evidence that this can actually be the case although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximize their beneficial role
8478812 this pattern of associations with earlier age of nonmelanoma skin cancer diagnosis being linked more strongly to the risk of developing subsequent malignancies is consistent with the pattern that one would expect for a marker of inherited predisposition to cancer
8478813 in conclusion our results suggest that nut corn and popcorn consumption is not associated with an increased risk of incident diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding and may be protective for the former these findings refute the pervasive but unproven belief that these foods are associated with diverticular complications and suggest that the recommendation to avoid these foods in diverticular disease should be reconsidered
8478814 given that they have so far shown little willingness to fund programs outside the traditional purview of public health
8478815 we are not just dealing with a system that is overwhelmed by overcrowding though overcrowding is a serious problem in some prisons we are also dealing with a system that is overwhelmed by numbers the proposal to add 7 500 to these three massive prisons is going simply to add another set of places where regimes will suffer because they will have to accommodate the needs of several different kinds of prisoners who we expect to be kept from one another
8478816 those present were overwhelmingly opposed to the proposal and believed there were other ways of deploying the huge sums of money involved that would make a far more effective contribution to the governments stated objectives
8478817 prisoners will be accommodated in small units capable of addressing their needs and offending behaviour they will be situated close to those areas which generate the greatest volume of offenders therefore ensuring that important family and other links can be maintained
8478818 affordable web design should never mean cheap it simply refers to delivering great value for money without compromising business reputation or performance
8478819 champ when you get knocked down get up get up
8478820 afghanistan we dont read about it any more in the papers because its succeeded
8478821 we were surprised to find such a pronounced reduction in basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma incidence in users of ace inhibitors or arbs in such a high risk group over a short amount of time
8478822 because individuals at normal risk of keratinocyte cancer were not included in our study the extent to which the results might apply to such individuals is unknown
8478823 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them
8478824 relapse or the resumption of active drug taking and drug seeking is very common in drug addicts
8478825 addiction related brain changes and behaviors seem to be hardwired and semipermanent and there are limited treatment options our data suggest that rather than trying to block the process of increasing dendritic spine density we may actually want to look at treatments that try to enhance this process
8478826 this suggests the exciting possibility that mef2 proteins may control expression of key genes that modulate drug related brain changes and behavior
8478827 if we understand which genes are influenced by mef2 we can intervene and try to help the system resist or reverse these sensitization processes
8478828 republikeinse presidenten hebben de vs verzwakt door hun unilateralisme maar obama is klaar om amerika te leiden en het amerikaanse leiderschap in de wereld te herstellen
8478829 barack obama weet dat amerika niet in het buitenland sterk kan zijn zonder thuis sterk te zijn
8478830 ik sta hier als trotse supporter van barack obama het is tijd om ons te verenigen zodat we ons land terug kunnen eisen niemand kan langs de zijlijn blijven staan
8478831 no se puede tener una regla para unos y otra para otros
8478832 por qu tuve que reconocer la separaci n de las regiones de georgia
8478833 despu s de la ca da del comunismo rusia asumi la p rdida de 14 antiguas rep blicas que se convirtieron en estados a pesar de que 25 millones de rusos fueron abandonados en pa ses que no consideraban suyos algunas de esas naciones no fueron capaces de tratar a sus minor as con el respeto que merecen georgia inmediatamente arranc su autonom a a las regiones aut nomas de abjazia y osetia del sur puede imaginarse lo que fue para los abjazos ver cerrada su universidad de sujumi por el gobierno de tbilisi bajo el argumento de que supuestamente no ten an una lengua adecuada o una historia o cultura por lo que no necesitaban una universidad la reci n independizada georgia inici una guerra despiadada contra las minor as desplazando a miles de personas
8478834 ignorando las advertencias de rusia los pa ses occidentales se precipitaron a reconocer la ilegal declaraci n de independencia que hizo kosovo respecto de serbia nosotros argumentamos constantemente que ser a imposible despu s de esto decirle a los abjazos y osetios y decenas de otros grupos en todo el mundo que lo que era bueno para los albano kosovares no era bueno para ellos en las relaciones internacionales no se puede tener una regla para unos y otra para otros
8478835 hemos tratado constantemente de persuadir a los georgianos para llegar a un acuerdo sobre la renuncia al uso de la fuerza contra los osetios y los abjazos pero el presidente georgiano mija l saakashvili lo rechaz la noche del 7 al 8 de agosto supimos por qu s lo un loco podr a haber hecho esa apuesta cre a que rusia se quedar a sin hacer nada mientras lanzaba un ataque contra la tranquila ciudad de tsjinvali matando a cientos de pac ficos civiles la mayor a de ellos rusos cre a que rusia se quedar a a un lado mientras sus tropas de paz disparaban contra los camaradas rusos con los que se supon a que deb an impedir problemas en osetia del sur
8478836 rusia no ten a otra opci n que aplastar el ataque para salvar vidas restablecimos la paz pero no pudimos calmar los temores y aspiraciones de los osetios y abjazos

8478853 to make griffiss international airport the airport that we want it to be to be able to get out of a business that was costing the taxpayers money to venture with a partnership with a company that has a proven track record of bringing in corporate aircraft and military aircraft to enhance the overall economic activity there
8478854 we regret that we missed the opportunity to tell matthew mitchams story we apologise for this unintentional omission
8478855 technology is playing an important role in this convention more so than ever before
8478856 what made me get into blogging was wanting to have a voice in politics
8478857 i think theres a strong argument for saying that more of the training which occurs can be done in regional and country areas where theres less population and where there are valuable job opportunities
8478858 theoretically it should be impossible for two planes to collide so theres obviously been a failure a serious failure somewhere in the system but im advised that training there has been undertaken for many many years with a good safety record
8478859 i think one of the things that we would like to see over time is more of this sort of training undertaken in less densely populated areas and i suspect thats one of the things that may come out of the reports
8478860 its one of the busiest airports in australia i think there are something like 500 000 air movements there each year
8478861 its also im advised one of the safest but obviously we want to ensure that the airports are as safe as possible
8478862 obviously yesterday was a tragic accident and tragic for the family concerned but it could have been worse
8478863 we are grateful for the fact no schools or occupied houses were affected but we will look very closely at the report of the coroner and casa
8478864 we want to look back to where the accident happened to see where the bits flew down
8478865 the reason we are here at the crash site today is to see if there was anything wrong with the aircraft prior to the accident
8478866 the pilot had more than 250 hours experience before he became an instructor
8478867 there are problems and they are mostly to do with accent
8478868 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
8478869 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8478870 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8478871 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8478872 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
8478873 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8478874 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
8478875 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8478876 our study shows that these views are incorrect and illustrate the potential for the human brain to rapidly and dynamically reorganize itself
8478877 we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight and we believe that these principles may also apply to other sensory loss such as deafness or loss of function following brain injury
8478878 were not even validating such an outrageous and preposterous claim with a comment
8478879 self interest is still the most powerful force in politics
8478880 afghanistan the carter administration armed the mujahideen to defeat russia who had a real interest there the reagan administration followed that policy afterward we left bye bye welcome talaban and alquida

8478920 the veline model would not be a problem if it was one of many models offered on television but we dont have television that seems to be capable of other options
8478921 at times there are terrible programs in say britain or spain but at least viewers have a richer variety of shows to choose from
8478922 for men its a bit of a trap and for women they represent a model of success and fashion
8478923 television is a mirror of society and italian society tells women that you have to look sexy and young all the time

8478935 oh look at that poor woman out without her keeper
8478936 weve got a pretty big country they could be just about anywhere
8478937 i believe that in this case it sure would seem to me that the most critical thing to do would have been to inform the public at first time in the morning to ensure that people were aware of this

8478960 i could tell you were angry your eyes looked angry
8478961 you must feel sad youre not smiling tell me about it
8478962 not worried about it theres places besides denver where we need and will get clintons help winning this election
8478963 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8478964 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver for whom will you vote
8478965 this is the kind of question that i predict and this has nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at five 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent
8478966 what his strategy is to go around drumming stuff on obama his crazy quotes and hes cultivated a careful reputation for being eccentric and therefore hillary is not blamed for what he does and the result is he can go around and dump on obama and almost be like a negative greek chorus
8478967 to defeat barack obama and make sure hillary can get elected in 2012
8478968 one of the most unique and beloved figures in the democratic party and the country
8478969 talk about why senator obama is the right leader right now
8478970 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums
8478971 it wouldnt make sense for me to want to edit his remarks
8478972 bill clintons place in the hearts of democrats is very secure he rescued us from the wilderness
8478973 we had been wandering there for 40 years having lost three presidential elections
8478974 now were turning a page barack obama is going to be our next president and i expect bill clinton to be campaigning for him
8478975 he will assert that role in any number of ways well see one of those ways when he gives a speech at the convention
8478976 if anything i wouldnt be at all surprised to see clinton give a very strong speech in support of obama
8478977 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums that ungrateful ego
8478978 your intrusion alarm has been triggered press 1 to ring your home phone

8478981 i have been parking in the car park since 1996 and only had a third party insurance coverage now i am saddled with a new car loan
8478982 when i got to my bike after work i realised the keyhole had been tampered with and the handle had been kicked to dislodge the lock
8478983 unfortunately the heavy downpour caused water to seep in and damage the seats i didnt lose my valuables but the repair bill was high
8478984 they usually disappear when i start to observe them but i am only here a few hours daily they might be studying my routine too
8478985 i advise motorists and motorcyclists not to park in back lanes and areas far from public view because vehicle thefts are on the rise if there is no choice invest in steering locks and central locking systems
8478986 from january to august we have had 17 cases at the station and most occurred between 6am and noon
8478987 we also have to look at whether the parking lots were guarded and i sincerely ask that car owners increase the safety measures in their vehicles
8478988 ive been working here for about a year and i always keep an eye out for suspicious characters lingering near the cars
8478989 these people were very daring to commit the crime at 9am when i had my back turned for a few minutes
8478990 i have all the emergency numbers needed should anything happen while im on watch

8479000 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8479001 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat terrorism
8479002 strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries thats what kennedy did with khrushchev thats what reagan did with
8479003 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8479004 on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8479005 i have known and been friends with john mccain for almost 22 years but every day now i learn something new about candidate mccain to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8479006 great speech and the best case for obama weve heard yet
8479007 he still embraces the extreme philosophy that has defined his party for more than 25 years
8479008 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8479009 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8479010 that primary generated so much heat it probably speeded up global warming
8479011 shes going to do everything she can to elect barack obama
8479012 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8479013 but we have important work to do tonight i am here tonight first to support barack obama
8479014 and second im here to warm up the crowd for joe biden
8479015 madame secretary on behalf of the great state of new york
8479016 with eyes firmly fixed on the future with the spirt of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8479017 my mother was not able to get a credit card unless my father signed for it and my father didnt believe in credit cards so she didnt get one even though she probably made more money than he did i have always wanted an opportunity to vote for a qualified woman theres no question that hillary clinton is qualified
8479018 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8479019 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8479020 change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things
8479021 these rains will likely produce life threatening flash floods and mud slides
8479022 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
8479023 made applicable to the state of new york by the fourteenth amendment of the said constitution
8479024 the procedure was almost too preposterous for secretary of state seward who on july 20 1868 issued a very tentative proclamation of ratification
8479025 not for us but wed like to see something more from you
8479026 write all the time and never pay anyone to publish your work
8479027 im not annoying when i talk on my cell phone i never talk when i drive i never talk in theaters i dont talk while standing in line
8479028 therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus
8479029 if you are guilty before god should he send you to heaven or hell
8479030 does it concern you that you are going to hell
8479031 or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of god
8479032 therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus
8479033 this is an operation that hasnt been done before it took a real team effort
8479034 we also took a skin graft from his thigh area to help fill in the large indentation of his lower lip to rebuild the area
8479035 its really the work of the doctors in ireland that have helped alan come this far they were essential in his early life saving resuscitation and permanently maintaining his breathing and feeding tubes throughout the years
8479036 we suspect based on what we were able to see that the tongue is so undeveloped its unlikely at this point that we will be able to restore swallowing and breathing
8479037 his mom bernie has been so supportive throughout this entire process
8479038 she had the biggest smile on her face when the surgery was completed
8479039 his tenacity is what really propelled him to have the operation
8479040 initially i think there was some concern on part of his parents but it was alans motivation that gave him the support to get him through these procedures
8479041 its a great success not only physically but a new chance for his self esteem and self confidence

8479046 dismayed by the collapse of the iemma governments electricity privatisation plan the australian industry group ai group says
8479047 whatever is happening politically the bottom line is tomorrow morning the government is going to have to make a decision about building two power stations which are going to cost upwards of 10 billion mr goodsell said today
8479048 it doesnt have the money and it is going to come out of schools transport and other infrastructure budgets or alternatively the state will start to go into dangerous levels of debt
8479049 the business community is not only dismayed that it has happened it is confused by how it has happened because anybody who understands government finances and the energy issue thinks there was no alternative to privatisation mr goodsell said
8479050 nsw now has a very dangerous situation where it cant invite the private sector to help fund this important infrastructure and it doesnt have the money in the forward estimates of the budget to do it itself
8479051 the defeat of the electricity sale is extremely disappointing and will have serious implications on the development of new transport infrastructure in nsw ttf spokesman stewart prins said
8479052 it means that taxpayers money will stay tied up in obsolete coal fired power generators instead of being re invested in critical capacity building urban transport projects such as the m4 east and the proposed metro rail system
8479053 we would urge the liberal party to certainly reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics mr blunden said
8479054 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue
8479055 the sport out there felt like real sport real passion real competition
8479056 sometimes when i watch the premier league i think its becoming what is it becoming does it really mean as much to the people who are playing i think that todays players dont have that same level of emotional attachment to the clubs they represent
8479057 with so much money involved does it mean as much to the individuals in it
8479058 my worry long term is if the premier league becomes a league table of individual wealth for the 20 wealthiest individuals around the world what will that mean
8479059 it wont mean a great deal at all and that will mean we have lost something incredibly precious which is institutions like liverpool that inspire local pride
8479060 clubs have drifted too far from their supporter base in recent times and they need to come back to their roots
8479061 football finances are very fragile and we have seen examples in the past where clubs have over reached themselves and it has had devastating consequences for the supporters more than anybody
8479062 there has been concern in recent times about the way in which some clubs have been taken over the debts are just guaranteed and there isnt a great deal of new money coming into the clubs
8479063 investoren die startups ins leben helfen der schwerpunkt von archimedes liegt in
8479064 the board of directors is firmly committed to dan mudd
8479065 the board will continue to work closely with dan and his management team to guide the company and support the housing finance system through a very challenging period
8479066 this team will be responsible for meeting the dual objectives of conserving capital and controlling credit losses while fannie mae continues to provide crucial liquidity to the u s housing and mortgage markets
8479067 its not a great result at home when you should have done better
8479068 we gave away the ball way too much in the second half
8479069 a bit of lack of concentration could have cost us the game but we won and if we play well defensively down there theres no reason we shouldnt win
8479070 i think we showed were the better team when we moved the ball around but it wasnt our best game
8479071 we had chances in the second half and didnt score
8479072 but we didnt show all we have i think well do better in the home leg
8479073 i saw lots of amateur situations from the men in white the impact red and white real esteli and yellow and black the officials
8479074 but a win is a win the 1 0 is better than it seems because it forces them to win a game and if we can score an away goal it could be a huge advantage for us
8479075 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning
8479076 such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning between subliminal signals present in a given situation and choice outcomes
8479077 we reasoned that if subjects were unable to correctly perceive any difference between the masked cues then they were also unable to build conscious representations of cue outcome associations
8479078 the ventral striatum responded to subliminal cues and to visible outcomes in a manner that closely approximates our computational algorithm expressing reward expected values and prediction errors
8479079 we conclude that even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making
8479080 we are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels
8479081 this means the benefits of the diet a diet that is lifesaving in many children and therapeutic in most of them continue to outweigh the risks

8479086 while it may not have changed this outcome as a result of this incident we are evaluating our use of level i security holsters
8479087 also today palmetto health agreed to create a separate waiting area for our inmates
8479088 while no policy can protect against every possibility we will continue to review our policies and procedures
8479089 while the increase in the number of children with disability attending school is encouraging more has to be done to close the significant gap in employment between people with disability and people without disability
8479090 australia picked up 31 medals with the assistance of sportstecs coaching tools including in basketball equestrian hockey softball swimming water polo and synchronised diving
8479091 this is a fantastic result and a gold medal performance in itself for this terrific nsw company
8479092 its an inspiration and hopefully the start to a great campaign
8479093 this should be a coronation not an election but the republicans will unleash negative ads against barack that will make the swift boating of kerry look like kindergarten
8479094 they have to distort the truth to get elected we dont but we have to speak the truth and speak it with toughness throughout this campaign
8479095 but we have to speak the truth and speak it with toughness throughout this campaign
8479096 whatever is happening politically the bottom line is tomorrow morning the government is going to have to make a decision about building two power stations which are going to cost upwards of 10 billion

8479145 winning this prize was a great reward for our intense construction work during the last few months
8479146 the achievement of managing a big team over many months and even making select construction tasks part of undergraduate teaching cannot be estimated highly enough the enthusiasm the students show in renewable energies and the development of innovative solutions should serve the industry as an example for the development of new technologies
8479147 the expert knowledge the students acquired during this project constitute an unique experience which will prove extremely helpful in their future careers the ventomobile and its competitors represent excellent and creative examples of intelligent uses of wind energy
8479148 our hope is that this research will improve the screening process for migraine in soldiers and increase education about migraine for soldiers and their health care providers u s military personnel should receive the best health care available and improving the diagnosis and treatment of migraine will likely improve soldiers personal and professional functioning
8479149 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8479150 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet
8479151 so why did elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall to levels similar to the pre industrial era that is the million dollar question which researchers will no doubt be trying to answer during the next few years
8479152 by knowing this minimum galaxy mass we can better understand how dark matter behaves which is essential to one day learning how our universe and life as we know it came to be
8479153 suppose you are an alien flying over earth and identifying urban areas from the concentration of lights in the night from the brightness of the lights you may surmise for example that more humans live in los angeles than in mumbai but this is not the case
8479154 what we have discovered is more extreme and akin to saying that all metro areas even those that are barely visible at night to the aliens have a population of about 10 million
8479155 we are excited because these galaxies are virtually invisible yet contain a tremendous amount of dark matter
8479156 this helps us better understand the particle that makes up dark matter and it teaches us something about how galaxies form in the universe
8479157 particularly intriguing are the unusual categories of vocalizations and the more frequent loud harmonics evident in the btbr t tf j btbr mouse model of autism that may resemble the atypical vocalizations seen in some autistic infants
8479158 we hypothesize that ultrasonic vocalizations may be a measure of social communication in mice delayed reduced or unusual ultrasonic vocalizations in mice could offer a useful assay with reasonable face validity to the second diagnostic symptom of autism impaired communication
8479159 this lidar will serve as a reference for future or existing systems especially since this kind of remote sensing is experiencing rapid development
8479160 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8479161 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8479162 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8479163 regardless of the mechanism or explanation physicians should be careful when assessing each patients medication needs
8479164 patients also need to take their medications exactly as prescribed after an ami statins in particular should only be withdrawn after an ami under close clinical supervision

8479186 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno

8479188 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
8479189 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8479190 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico

8479335 the majority of gpgs investments are sound strategic long term holdings where we are confident of intrinsic value regardless of share price fluctuations
8479336 arguably misplaced investment judgment where prospects of recovery were more remote and where cost exceeded market value

8479343 he became moody because of some crack his sister made about him he couldnt shake it off
8479344 i am going to throw myself off the cruise ship

8479346 dad i dont know whats wrong with me this thing grabbed me
8479347 this cloud this black demon on his shoulder or whatever it was that hit him did not return for the rest of the cruise
8479348 we figured well he seems to be okay because he is here with his friends and having a great time he was a real goof around kid he always liked to make people laugh he continued to be the same type of person he was good old kelts again
8479349 we didnt know what happened on the ship but we wanted to forget it as soon as possible

8479356 he couldnt sleep he wanted to do so well in school but he lost concentration so his marks deteriorated he had such high expectations
8479357 they were confused as well because he had made such a right turn
8479358 im going to get into a fight in this hockey game for you
8479359 i felt so bad when i left him in my rental car he was standing in the snow he was looking back at me i left as late as i could he turned around and walked back into the dorm i felt like i had abandoned him
8479360 i dont even like to think of it it was just so weird he was talking about some personal problem he was having
8479361 he was so confused he said you know mom what do you think dad would say if i became a priest i said dad would love you no matter what in the same breath he was talking about going into the army he was all over the map
8479362 i just hugged him and lay on the bed with him i patted his head i wanted him so much to be better he was so worried about me being worried about him
8479363 mom im going to be okay im going to be okay
8479364 i drove away and i hoped he was better i just didnt know i was getting so confused too when you want something so much you kind of will it into yourself i wanted him to be better

8479377 i believe people with depression suffer so greatly that god could be sitting on your right hand shoulder and it wouldnt be enough
8479378 his hair was all wet he had a towel wrapped around him he was so beautiful a thrill went up and down my spine

8479392 if her sport was drinking that would be the perfect dress
8479393 give him 10 more of them and he wont drop them
8479394 salty didnt take it for granted the ball was going to be caught it worked out well for us
8479395 thats what were taught since little league to hustle and run the ball out thats the fundamentals of baseball we were in a tight situation we needed a big hit i thought when he hit it that i had to run as hard as i can especially since im not in the lineup everyday i busted my fanny as hard as i could rounding third i saw him drop it and i thought they might throw me out at home then i saw catcher miguel olivo out there too and i knew i had it
8479396 obviously the error hurt but it shouldnt have been as close as it was either
8479397 a lot of that has to do with lack of run production when we should produce third inning runner on second nobody out and we dont get him over fourth inning runners on second and third with nobody out and we dont score a run out of that too
8479398 it should have been caught and you dont get a lot of practice at it it should have stuck in the glove and it didnt its kind of unexpected
8479399 i felt good thats the best ive felt in four five months
8479400 i was really disappointed the way he had served the point before he served right at me for sure
8479401 i wasnt going for him up 6 2 6 2 5 2
8479402 it was a bad miss i was really excited about the way i was playing to end it that way was a little disappointing
8479403 it was the obvious best short term solution for me right now
8479404 i figure he was someone who knew my game and my personality
8479405 he is a little bit streaky i have to be ready for that moment that he takes a little break mentally
8479406 i dont really think about the record going into the games
8479407 i just try to remember what ive done to them in games past and how i got different guys out stick with the game plan and execute it until they try to do something else
8479408 you know hes going to pitch a good game and put up a lot of zeros
8479409 hes one of the premier pitchers in the league so i knew i couldnt make a mistake
8479410 roy and two big swings are all we needed tonight
8479411 i dont know if it was the first inning going a bunch of pitches right out of the chute
8479412 i kind of ran down a little bit i thought maybe i could get through the eighth but that was pushing it

8479441 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8479443 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche

8479445 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8479460 all animals are equal some animals are more equal than others
8479461 it was a really tough one and i am completely out of breath
8479462 i struggled out there and my opponent played really really well and pushed me to the limit
8479463 i am not yet at my full potential i still have a long way to go to be where i want to be
8479464 today i played much better than my first match so its looking good for me
8479465 definitely im not in my best shape now and i havent been playing well before the u s open
8479466 but grand slams kind of keep me much more motivated and i do much more better in grand slams
8479467 it was not that painful when i continued to play but i hope i can recover

8479476 would you like to save 20 by opening an account with us
8479477 id much rather pay as much as i can as often as i can i dont want to save 20 is there anyway that i can pay 20 more by using my costco card
8479478 youd be surprised how many people do want to pay more i believe you
8479479 let me ask you a question and answer me honestly
8479480 do you really think it makes sense to open a charge account at target so i can save 20 on an 89 cent box of mints
8479481 well you could go buy something else and save money that way
8479482 how am i going to save money by going and buying stuff i dont need isnt not spending any money at all better than saving 20 on a higher amount
8479483 but what if your 20 saves you so much money that what you bought is free
8479484 but the real issue is that people like me get tired of being asked whether we want to save money and then be treated like the village idiots for not wanting another credit card or being asked for my zip code when that has absolutely nothing to do with buying a phone recharger or having a grocery store insist of giving it my phone number so i can get the
8479485 theres no way i would let a door to door salesman in my house even if he was selling cheap mints
8479486 i dont think i could i mean this is really loud and distracting besides this band sucks
8479487 every time he comes in here he tells me im going to go deaf working here and i always tell him that ive got a few years to go before im old and deaf like him
8479488 i doubt hes deaf he probably just finds it annoying like me
8479489 yeah youre right but all the stores play music like this dont you go to any of the other stores in the mall
8479490 you sound like my dad he has no idea whats going on around here either
8479491 i remember when small medium and large meant 8 12 and 16 ounces now most soft drinks start at 16 ounces in the old days you could not order a 12 or 16 ounce cup of coffee anywhere much less in every other storefront in the united states i guess im just out of it
8479492 we didnt have a toilet in our apartment wed have to go down the hall to the communal shitter and do our business there thats just how it was now no ones happy unless theres a toilet in every room and at least one has to have that little spritzer that tickles your tuchus different time

8479505 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable
8479506 therefore republicans and democrats should be held to the same standards

8479512 ebay is getting very frustrating especially for someone like me who has a store with 2500 items in it every time they make changes like the ones they just announced it takes me days and weeks to make all the changes what is more frustrating is that when someone is unclear and i need to find out what i should do in my case i get conflicting answers from different customer service agents

8479530 im a devout catholic even though i support baby murder
8479531 since ive never been called a man of few words let me say this simply as i can yes yes i accept your nomination to run and serve with barack obama the next president of the united states
8479532 he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept the situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8479533 i thought it was nothing but we heard it again so i went to my gun safe and got my gun
8479534 i checked my backyard flipped on the back light and opened the door and there was this guy standing there
8479535 i ordered him to the ground and kept my gun trained on him the whole time
8479536 i think i told him to get down like 15 or 20 times but he finally did then he got up and started coming toward me i just lifted my gun and fired it into the air once and he finally obeyed after that
8479537 he took ownership for the safety of his family and his community
8479538 i feel the best way to protect my family in this circumstance was to have a gun
8479539 when criminals know that homeowners have guns theyre less likely to commit crimes
8479540 he could have been watching us and listening to everything we were saying
8479541 barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual
8479542 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma
8479543 ill tell you what happened that witch had used his psychic abilities to summon help before i could kill him i found myself surrounded by that girls two sisters the mcneill woman a man surrounded by blue lights some woman i dont even know and another man who just might be a daemon
8479544 and do you want to know what else i had discovered one of the witches is not only pregnant but she might be as powerful as myself and the same can be said about the man with the demonic powers something you had failed to tell me
8479545 we dont know anything about a daemon as for the witch well we knew she was carrying a powerful baby but we didnt realize it would be as powerful as you
8479546 you had extensive details on the other halliwell witches and the mcneill witches
8479547 and you expect me to believe that you knew nothing about the extent of the pregnant witchs powers or the daemon do you take me for a fool
8479548 no your eminence we sim our source had failed to provide this information to us
8479549 then i suggest that you make your source understand the repercussions of his failure to inform you
8479550 now i want to know everything about these people their secrets and the extent of their powers including the daemon
8479551 one question is there a way to steal this daemons powers he struck me as being very powerful
8479552 if this daemon was with the charmed ones and the mcneills he must be belthazor i understand that he is very powerful even more powerful than he had been as the source together with his powers and yours we could possibly kill the pregnant witch
8479553 i will kill the witch i take the demons powers and together with mine i will kill her child am i clear
8479554 start preparing a potion or spell that will steal this belthazors powers
8479555 im sure that well be able to your eminence its just a matter of time
8479556 meanwhile i will be in my room meditating i this mortal he is still making it impossible for me to completely control him and have this one
8479557 dont blame me he stood me up thanks to his eminence
8479558 all right no more procrastinating make an appointment to see belthazor tomorrow get him to meet you at the office
8479559 we have to get our hands on his powers as soon as possible
8479560 yeah martin it has been a long time like three weeks
8479561 yeah well your boss wasnt exactly thrilled to see me what can i say it was san francisco pd who stumbled across his body
8479562 what do i want this time marty why do you always assume im after something
8479563 i guess dodging that sorcerers attack must have took a lot out of him
8479564 im not surprised this dako seemed very powerful harrys lucky to be alive
8479565 i understand that paige was also lucky first degree burns
8479566 all right marty you got me i do need a favor is there a way for me to get a copy of the s s enigmas manifest it had arrived in san francisco the day before yesterday i also need its manifest before it had departed from singapore
8479567 she and marty are old friends he used to work for san francisco pd they tend to flirt sometimes but its nothing serious hes married
8479568 i deflected his electrokinesis right back to him hitting him in the chest
8479569 did she also tell you how phoebe and piper had reacted
8479570 piper well both she and phoebe pointed out that i had used unnecessary force to stop dar uh dako and that i could have killed darryl
8479571 you should have seen the look on phoebes face i never realized until now that i have lost my chances with her things will never go back to what it used to be
8479572 so what why should you care about what they think about you youre not part of their family anymore
8479573 unless you plan to change that situation sometime in the future
8479574 thats just it i dont see it happening its just im tired im tired of taking the blame for all that happened earlier this year and im tired of their self righteous crap over everything that i do
8479575 look cole i know what youre going through ive been through the same myself believe me
8479576 her name was pamela pamela davidoff i had met her during my first year in college at first she seemed like the world to me i thought that she liked me for myself jack mcneill
8479577 ive never exactly been a promising child if you know what i mean many other mcneills tend to view me as morally ambiguous and have always disapproved of me and perhaps theyre right about me being the perfect citizen or the perfect witch was never my forte hell i went through three whitelighters before i was twenty one
8479578 my parents on the other hand had treated me differently and thank god because if they hadnt my life would have been hell
8479579 well like i said i had met her during my first year in college the mcneills were well known still are and pamelas family didnt like the idea of us dating regardless of how much money my family had
8479580 the davidoffs were also witches by the way i had met her at a wicca club but not many of them had a psychic ability like the mcneills or the morgans as for pamela i thought she was different from her family until i found out differently
8479581 pamela she found out that i had helped a daemon this was back in early 67 the demon name was marbas
8479582 and i helped him after discovering that another demon was using him as a diversion in order to steal this pendant i didnt bother to vanquish marbas since it was obvious that he was being framed well pamela and her family found out they hit the roof she dropped me like a hot potato making it clear that she regarded me no more than a borderline warlock
8479583 im sorry did you did you try to win her back
8479584 unfortunately yes but pamela wouldnt have anything to do with me and i became bitter i would have stayed that way if hadnt met gwen who by the way had also found out what happened between marbas and me but as far as gwen was concerned i did right marbas was the innocent in that incident regardless in whether he was a daemon or not shes a true wiccan by the way i cant say the same about a few of my in laws
8479585 yeah i did not long after i had met gwen she decided that she wanted me back but in the end i realized that it was too late for us and i had fallen in love with gwen by that time dont get me wrong i had some happy times with pam but she never seemed willing to accept me for myself and to be honest ive never regretted marrying gwen not in a long shot
8479586 as for phoebe i dont know if shell ever change but its obvious that unless youre willing to become the man she wants shell never accept you not really and quite frankly i think its time you stop worrying about what she and her family thinks about you and live your own life
8479587 why is it that every time i talk to marty i end up finding myself in the middle of a bargaining session
8479588 perhaps poor marty has finally realized that hes given you one too many favors over the years
8479589 so what was it that you asked marty for a manifest
8479590 yeah one for the s s enigma i have this suspicion that dako had somehow arrived on that ship thanks to the crozats dont ask me why but i find it odd that our troubles with both them and dako had occurred during the same week
8479591 youre saying that the crozats might be responsible for this bokor i guess its possible if they knew someone connected with vodoun especially if the crozats probably considered us too powerful to deal with themselves
8479592 that the crozats might have bitten off more than they can chew if they have a spell to vanquish dako
8479593 if they have it wont do them any good theyre missing one important factor
8479594 right only a vodoun houngan or mamba can vanquish dako whoever sent dako to the crozats probably forgotten to mention that one little matter or did he
8479595 the potion is ready all we have to do now is find darryl
8479596 this potion is only good for freeing darryls body from whatshisname how do we vanquish it
8479597 what power of three paige is in the hospital and we cant get leo to heal her without drawing suspicions from the doctors
8479598 maybe maybe olivia was right about cecile being the only one who can vanquish this spirit i mean think about it even though her premonitions were being blocked cecile managed to detect that something wrong would happen to darryl the only premonition i had was one with him at a crime scene and even when i had been with paige all morning i didnt get one premonition of her being attacked yet cecile managed to get one even if she didnt see the attacker
8479599 cmon pheebs do you really believe that cecile is the only one of us capable of defeating dako just because shes into voodoo if i recall all of us helped an ling defeat yen lo inside the zen limbo and you and paige helped ava vanquished orrin when he had the evil eye using both a gypsy spell and wicca magic i might add
8479600 if cecile can find some voodoo spell i have no problem with using it but i still think well have just as much chance with success with this
8479601 maybe we cant use the power of three but with the power of two and the baby
8479602 yeah along with olivia cecile and maybe even bruce or mrs mcneill right

8479657 i am necessarily disadvantaged by an inability to assess the creditworthiness of the deponent or any other supporting witness the challenge lays out the structure of a cogent cross examination but i can do no more than guess at its ultimate effectiveness i suspect that it may very well achieve the extinction of any sense of unease that the present untested assertions are capable of creating but merely to state this is to note the distinction between what should be determined at inquiry and my task which is to determine whether an inquiry should be held

8479673 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8479674 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8479675 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8479676 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8479677 being able to experience it takes it to a whole different level and i just want to bring that back and share it with my students
8479678 i wish i could but they wouldnt let me off
8479679 i decided i might get a chance to vote for a woman in my lifetime but i probably wont get another chance to vote for someone like mr obama so i thought i better grab it
8479680 i wished it and i hoped it but i never thought id be able to see it
8479681 never in my wildest dreams would i have expected this
8479682 i think that many didnt want to get their hopes up too high and some refused to dare to dream that it could really happen
8479683 as time went on and people learned about barack obama we began to believe that the u s would truly elect a president based on substance and not on race
8479684 the message it sends to the world on behalf of the nation is that we have moved beyond race as the defining factor in our country
8479685 i think michelle obama kicked it off pretty well dont you think
8479686 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house down last night
8479687 what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first thank you president clinton
8479688 the whole biden family on this journey with me to take america back
8479689 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the effort to take america back
8479690 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8479691 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8479692 im going to be vice president of my fantasy football league
8479693 the process in selecting a vp is one that john mccain is keeping very close to his chest
8479694 hes a person i have a lot of confidence in i think hes going to do the right thing
8479695 its an honor to have your name mentioned or something like that
8479696 to paraphrase mae west sometimes a vacation is just a vacation hes just on vacation
8479697 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8479698 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8479699 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the english language be the vice presidents office is on the phone
8479700 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8479701 this is the time as americans together we get back up
8479702 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8479703 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8479704 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8479705 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8479706 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8479707 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8479708 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8479709 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8479710 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8479711 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8479712 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8479713 the politics of jealously or envy or a sense that somehow were going to be less likely to vote for someone because theyve achieved economic success
8479714 it would also breach essential principles of the rule of law and international human rights
8479715 most significantly it would run contrary to the methodist churchs own avowed commitment given publicly at its annual conference to promote human rights the 1997 constitution and the rule of law
8479716 1997 constitution section 35 of the 1997 constitution which states that every person has the right to freedom of conscience religion and belief

8479727 he knows how good he is as a knife fighter
8479728 a fear psychosis is being created to slow down certain projects of national importance this will be counter productive for the countrys economic growth its global image as well as our ability to attract investments from across the world
8479729 isnt quite the liberal he was when he provided fun fodder for a life social security having 5 trillion in the bank is being broke
8479730 no one can come to the father except through me
8479731 if it is hard for the righteous to be saved what will become of the ungodly and the sinner
8479732 i just cant imagine driving through my neighborhood at home and seeing a security checkpoint
8479733 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8479734 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8479735 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8479736 saw three letters a k a g and a b
8479737 i was inspired by his speeches is reason i ran i know washington is broken maybe i was part of that i was there for 18 yrs but its broken and thats why im for him
8479738 he knows his weaknesses and he wont be intimidated by him john mccain the fact that he is a national hero a war hero no question about it uses that to intimidate people
8479739 which is that has a temper that is dangerous for this country
8479740 joe biden is a guy that speaks out and doesnt filter everything
8479741 when youre in the senate you dont have to do that but when running for president or vice president you do
8479742 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8479743 bob barr our libertarian presidential candidate is being kept off the ballot in at least two states west virginia and maine because of missed deadlines
8479744 texas law doesnt make any exceptions for absurdly late nominating conventions
8479745 any delegate can vote on the floor all delegates must sign their name next to their vote and their signature and vote are open record
8479746 there will be no unity in the democratic party until the voices of the 18 million voters who support hillary clinton are heard and heeded
8479747 when bill clinton was running for president 16 years ago we were young and so uninformed we were enamored with him he spoke of how he wanted to make america a better place for all and so now its the younger generation who has seen the iraq war fear they may be called up to join and see their parents and grandparents struggling so it makes sense they would see barrack obama as our bill clinton
8479748 be careful what you wish for you may get it and realize it wasnt what you thought it would be
8479749 the obvious most effective action to punish the power thugs in our party
8479750 i am still committed to the causes that i have been fighting for in order to accomplish the agenda that i see for the country i have to have a democratic president
8479751 no one said the war would be easy nothing worth anything ever is
8479752 to the young mothers and fathers out there who can lift their little girls up on their shoulders and say see

8479754 historic first woman first black man blah blah blah is really starting to grate on me if we really do believe in equality lets stop drawing attention to our differences race religion or gender and just fight for the best person to lead america
8479755 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8479756 they did a good job bringing up a topic they wanted brought up
8479757 the third skirmish which harper appears set to launch next week likely wont kill what flanagan jokingly refers to as
8479758 you can fight a war with some objective less than total victory
8479759 would be enough to throw the liberals into turmoil and give harper
8479760 i dont think harper has to be thinking about a majority at all
8479761 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
8479762 reality tv as we know thrives on the drama which is usually played up creating intensity for the viewing experience geass is very much the same
8479763 shall the county enact an ordinance to increase real estate taxes in order to repeal the alcoholic drink tax
8479764 we fully expected he would challenge ours and quite frankly theirs is being challenged by other folks as well because theirs is clearly not legal
8479765 the proposed ordinance submitted by bar and restaurant owners violates the home rule charter of allegheny county which gives the governing body the power to levy taxes and because the referendum question does not give an alternate source of revenue if the current tax is eliminated
8479766 i know ill take a picture of it and find out what it is on the internet

8479769 it does make me feel better to know that nevada osha was in the wrong this only proves that
8479770 taken individually the irregularities in this case generally appear minor when reviewed in their entirety however we think you will agree that the handling of this case raised some significant concerns

8479780 i think the vote indicated that they were ready for a change in administration
8479781 were down about 5 000 a month on on our landline revenue from three years ago
8479782 the time for change has come and barack obama is the change we need
8479783 for eight years john mccain has fallen in line with every one of george bushs national security decisions and now he offers up four more years of the same failed policies barack obama has proven that he has the judgment to deliver the change we need
8479784 make better health care and benefits for veterans a higher priority than tax cuts for exxon mobil and the wealthiest americans
8479785 heres the thing are they breaking the law while we could certain make the case that its unethical and dont even need to argue that its amoral they seem to be obeying the letter of the law thus what might be needed would be a new law protecting these workers and for that law to be enforced
8479786 something that you didnt plug in or watch something that would give her a sense of responsibility
8479787 he gets the best dog food he gets all his shots
8479788 however no instruction has reached us about taking similar steps in the hills
8479789 i was on my way to sukna when some morcha supporters intercepted me
8479790 they did not pay any attention to our requests and put black paint on the front and rear number plates saying vehicles with wb registrations would not be allowed to enter the hills
8479791 there was a tension as the number plates of a vehicle had been painted black a complaint has been received and we are looking into it
8479792 today we closed our office offering gl registration to car owners who wanted it and assembled at the mirik more stopping vehicles carrying wb number plates and painting them in black in protest
8479793 so far we have painted the number plates of at least 70 vehicles mostly coming from siliguri
8479794 now if anybody wishes to obtain gl registration they can get it only from the morcha central committee
8479795 we want immediate administrative steps against the morcha supporters for forcibly blackening number plates and charging money for the so called gl registration
8479796 unless there is a change in the situation none of our members will take their vehicles to the hills as they feel insecure
8479797 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8479798 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8479799 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8479800 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8479801 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8479802 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8479803 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
8479804 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8479805 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8479806 the clinton and obama camps orchestrated a roll call that pleased most everyone upset almost no one and provided an historic moment for the nightly newscasts
8479807 it was another attempt by the party to show a united front coming out of this convention something that looks more possible by the day
8479808 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8479809 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country

8479814 at present because of the old system of keeping land records a district collector prior to land acquisition does not have a clear picture of the land use pattern

8479816 uk france the us and australia had an average salary increase of only 4 this year
8479817 earlier job seekers were expecting 20 25 increases when looking at a career switch now a more moderate 10 15 increase is acceptable as long as there is career growth
8479818 while companies are becoming cost conscious cutting salary is not the first measure they are resorting to
8479819 competitiveness of expatriate packages issues with different tax structures and of overall cost containment
8479820 our global graduate poll conducted with about 2500 students from the class of 2008 indicates growing employment concerns due to the weakening economy about 2 3 rd indicated mild high concern the average student expects to take 3 6 months after graduation to find a job
8479821 among the few sezs that are operational most are sector specific or it sezs there are also many captive sezs with a company itself being the developer when a lot of multi product sezs spanning an area of around 5 000 hectares or more become operational we will see an increase in the number of units in an sez

8479828 theres no measurable evidence or observation to prove or disprove gods existence
8479829 its very disappointing everytime theists try to distort science in order to establish their beliefs
8479830 i doubt a professor of physics would fall for that heat and cold thing either thats a pitfall for first year undergraduates i know i have been there the person who first wrote this email just set up a strawman version of science he wants to disprove then goes on to disprove it silliness in digital form
8479831 like i said a strawman version of science and their lecturers are set up it does not reflect reality at all
8479832 you are so proud to be an atheist because you find no proof that god exist right
8479833 theists believe in god because they find no proof that god doesnt exist
8479834 good please do that we dont need your business or the business of any of your friend

8479840 my pay is set by the remuneration authority and there is a pool of money left that is divided up among the councillors
8479841 running into the elections last year we probably took a bit of a hit then post election there were some disagreements on council and the city is very sensitive to any kind of bickering or squabbling as has happened in the past
8479842 i think effectively that its his judgment that chief executives are paid quite well and what he gets is enough i really respect that
8479843 this wasnt some sort of public statement i think he just felt he was being paid enough
8479844 we think hes done a very good job of course not everything can go right and at the speed you want but were happy with the progress
8479845 greater love has no man than this that he lay his life down for his friend
8479846 and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him
8479847 whoever is an enemy to allah and his angels and messengers to gabriel and michael lo allah is an enemy to those who reject faith
8479848 say obey allah and the messenger but if they turn back then surely allah does not love the unbelievers
8479849 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
8479850 over 60 000 books have been written against islam by the christian west

8479852 jesus set the example for love as did moses muhammad set an opposite example
8479853 moses said each man strap a sword to his side go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other each killing his brother and friend and neighbour the levites did as moses commanded and that day about three thousand of the people died
8479854 honey id like to have the internet friend i crushed on but have never met who its an infinitesimal possibility but still needs mentioning in the interests of full disclosure could possibly be a hairy prison inmate come stay with us for a week

8479858 lets be honest buffalo is about a 17 point favorite
8479859 in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters
8479860 mr peters subsequently met me socially at the karaka yearling sales i believe in early 2006 he thanked me for my assistance
8479861 the fact that a minister is in his job is a statement that i have confidence in them
8479862 we are not party to this issue because the u n security council was the approving authority
8479863 there are a great deal of things that can be done through dialogue
8479864 this wheel will be taller than the iconic 443 foot london eye

8479871 no state plays more football with more athletes moving on to the next level than texas
8479872 about whether theyre going to leave the state thats the no 1 step
8479873 once i find out if a particular person is willing to leave the state then im on them
8479874 i get them on our campus and its always better than they anticipate seeing our staff seeing our players and seeing what we have to offer
8479875 so when you get a kid from texas youre getting one whose well coached stronger and maybe cares a little more than somebody from another part of the country
8479876 even though theyre young i think youll see a lot of the texas guys come out and have big years
8479877 he has big play ability and he played the qb position in high school so he understands some of the things i see out there
8479878 they want to know they are going to play not necessarily right away but during their four years
8479879 and they see a team on the rise and they want to be a part of that to be part of something special theres always something about being the first a lot of young men they get enticed by that
8479880 but i couldve been recruited to go to asia and if the academics were good and the football and the staff id go there
8479881 theres some critical work we need to get done before the snow flies
8479882 one of the most historic and exciting events to happen since statehood
8479883 i am here for everyone i grew up with in scranton and wilmington i am here for the cops and firefighters the teachers and assembly line workers the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the american dream endures
8479884 so i know obamas picked out his running mate but whos his vice president going to be
8479885 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8479886 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8479887 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8479888 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8479889 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8479890 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8479891 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8479892 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8479893 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8479894 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8479895 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8479896 a menos que una oferta mayor prefiero mantenerla en la tienda es algo chido para tener como nuestra mascota especial
8479897 hab a dos luces de color naranja brillante que se quemaban como peque os soles
8479898 el m s peque o circund al mayor antes de que pareciera caer a tierra como una bolas de luz antes de que volaran sobre la ciudad
8479899 los vimos con horror en los tejados de mis vecinos durante dos minutos las naves no hac an ruido y parec an linternas chinas en llamas
8479900 no es normal y no podemos dejar de pensar que era como las sondas que enviamos a marte para investigar
8479901 se ha producido una gran acumulaci n de avistamientos semejantes de linternas chinas de tipo artesanal en todo el pa s y hago un llamado para que cualquier persona que las haya visto lo haga p blico
8479902 a partir de las descripciones detalladas de la pareja que he entrevistado me parece que se trata de un aut ntico avistamiento ovni digno de investigaci n
8479903 muchos j venes llevar varios tipos de armas peligrosas y han empezado a agruparse como una reacci n en contra de las nuevas medidas adoptadas por la polic a y los hombres de hisbah que los dispersaron
8479904 the whole biden family on this journey with me to take america back
8479905 we reassert our strong and continued support for georgias sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders and underline our respect and support for the democratic and legitimate government of georgia as we pursue a peaceful durable solution to this conflict
8479906 underlined the urgent neccessity to lower tension and to fully apply the six points of the ceasefire agreement
8479907 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aide using battleships
8479908 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
8479909 of course were going to discuss it that doesnt mean were going to force people to recognise
8479910 i had to be consistent and try to get a high percentage of my first serves in
8479911 i didnt return so well and i had a lot of ups and downs and big frustrations
8479912 but it is the first match it is always the trickiest one but hopefully the next one will be better
8479913 hopefully i can play even better in the next round
8479914 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8479915 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8479916 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8479917 i was concerned i was going to get my dress dirty
8479918 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match even when you feel tired
8479919 when i got into a dangerous situation so i started moving her around a little bit more in the second set i was able to gain more confidence
8479920 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8479921 i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8479922 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for president of the united states by acclamation
8479923 i have been asked to inform you that senator obama accepts the nomination
8479924 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8479925 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constiution
8479926 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8479927 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8479928 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8479929 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8479930 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8479931 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8479932 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8479933 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be the president of the united states
8479934 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8479935 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8479936 barack obama and i took very different journeys to this destination but we share a common story
8479937 mine began in scranton pennsylvania and then wilmington delaware with a dad who fell on hard economic times but who always told me champ when you get knocked down get up get up my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you you are everyones equal and everyone is equal to you
8479938 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure
8479939 you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8479940 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running he would have been a senator longer by the time hes inaugurated but essentially once you start running for president full time you dont have time to do much else
8479941 were any of the toys similar to the ones you have at home
8479942 every school year parents work to keep their children out of certain teachers classes because those teachers are bullies
8479943 it is often the parents who are least involved in their childrens lives whose children get the abusive teachers
8479944 you are looking for fear of the school yard anxiety about who will be in their class talk of having no friends worry about their teachers treatment of them and in general a focus on feeling safe rather than excited to be able to learn and grow
8479945 children who are bullied need to know they are not the problem
8479946 bullying is about the bully needing to feel powerful they believe their wants are more important than anyone elses
8479947 there are lifelong repercussions of bullying that effect the way a person functions in their home and in society said barnicke belleghem
8479948 bullying causes a loss in self confidence hinders achievement disrupts routines brings fear into the lives of parents and children
8479949 not plan to have a child before february 1 2009
8479950 currently be and always have been of the female gender

8479952 i judged one time for 10 minutes i had to look at a girls panties
8479953 for goodness sake if youre going to sit down in your outfit sit down in front of the mirror in it first and see what happens
8479954 plant your heel in the middle of your other shoe whenever you stop
8479955 if you do fall and it does happen although its never happened at fairest of the run off the stage crying get up laugh and keep going were not dolls were not perfect the judges know that
8479956 i used to suffer anxiety attacks and thats not just freaking out its a medical condition but at the fair i helped introduce rodney atkins in front of hundreds of people even if its not this one id encourage you to do the pageant
8479957 whether youre an a cup or a dd go with what you have you dont need plastic surgery
8479958 if you just want to talk about life in general call me or if your heel breaks call me call savannah weve probably got some shoes you can use even if you just dont have the money for a dress right now ive probably got one you can borrow were all in this together
8479959 but you dont have to be savannah will be there for you the whole time
8479960 for matt and myself itd be nice knowing what the situation would be and be able to move forward with it the way i look at it more than anything the sooner it can happen the sooner we can get past the interviews and media coverage that goes with it and you can prepare for the game
8479961 we know its getting close and you get that anxiety and excitement knowing the decision has to be made soon i am sure coach understands that and hell make the decision as soon as its necessary
8479962 hopefully well get in enough snaps with the first offensive line that both can play
8479963 i just wanted to make sure kurt gets his timing with the ones for this game much like we did in kansas city
8479964 you know youre a success when he turns and looks at his son or daughter and knows that they turned out better than he did
8479965 champ when you get knocked down get up get up

8479969 we need to send two more combat battalions to afghanistan
8479970 is at more of a high water mark than we are
8479971 one thing we never run into out there is a john mccain field organization
8479972 we think this is something that should be welcomed and celebrated the fact that were opening this up to average americans its been a great organizational tool we think about states colorado is a big battleground state and if it slips into the obama column from the mccain column his path just got a lot lot harder one of our best organizations now in the entire country will be in colorado as a result of this convention and the activities tomorrow night
8479973 fasciinatiion with flavors of moments past still lingering on our tongues

8479980 in this issue we decided to take a romantic turn down the lovers lane of street art
8479981 an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure
8479982 whole cities can be accommodated in complexes which take up less than 10 of the original land surface
8479983 i have a report from backstage at the emilys list event emilys list you know is that organization that great organization that elects democratic women today was their big gala event they had nancy pelosi hillary clinton and michelle obama all sharing the stage together and hillary clinton and michelle obama had a chance to meet backstage prior to that gala
8479984 i thought it would be a nice way to meet people and learn how to get to my classes

8479991 we need to make thunder bay a well respected and appreciated film centre where artists actors and producers from outside the city will want to come to make their movies
