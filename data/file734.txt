7340061 biden stole autobiographical material in effect making false claims about his own life
7340062 biden and reporters covering his campaign said that in speeches before and after that debate the senator has given kinnock credit for the same passionate rhetoric which he has used repeatedly in recent weeks
7340063 john quinlan a reporter for the sioux city journal said his notes showed biden said he was quoting kinnock when he used the same passage in a speech aug 14 stories in the new york times the boston globe and other newspapers also said biden had used the rhetoric and credited kinnock for it
7340064 the new york times reported that during a debate biden had plagiarized a speech by british labor party leader neil kinnock biden had used kinnocks words in speeches before always crediting him but this time he didnt

7340116 blackjack is beatable if you have good maths brain at the moment casino surveillance staff have to watch the tables and try to identify suspicious play using their experience and instincts this system does the same job automatically using computer vision techniques and algorithms

7340163 these are people i would never ever ever talk to even in a social situation

7340167 as olimp adas de pequim foram um evento esportivo espetacular mas foram celebrados com o pano de fundo das viola es dos direitos humanos com ativistas impedidos de expressar suas opini es pacificamente e que foram detidos sem cometer crime algum
7340168 as autoridades chinesas e o coi tinham uma oportunidade de exibir melhorias no cap tulo dos direitos humanos mas n o o fizeram hora do coi levar pr tica seus princ pios essenciais
7340169 a maioria dos rep rteres estrangeiros p de cobrir normalmente os eventos esportivos enquanto a pol cia e seus auxiliares civis repetidamente preveniam jornalistas que tentavam coberturas mais ousadas ou mesmo mat rias investigativas sens veis ao governo
7340170 como tememos os jogos foram um per odo de pris es condena es censura al m da deten o de mais de 100 jornalistas blogueiros e dissidentes
7340171 essa repress o ser lembrando como uma das caracter sticas definitivas das olimp adas de pequim e claro o coi ter que aceitar a responsabilidade que tem por isso
7340172 nenhum prisioneiro pol tico foi solto desde que os jogos come aram em 8 de agosto mas muitos ao contr rio tiveram uma piora nas suas condi es de pris o e sa de um total de 31 jornalistas blogueiros e ativistas da livre express o est o presos ou tiveram voz de pris o desde o come o do ano
7340173 n s clamamos pela comunidade internacional principalmente aos membros da m dia que n o tirem seus olhos da china depois das olimp adas porque as autoridade do partido comunista devem intensificar sua hostilidade aos protestantes
7340174 n o s tibetanos mas todo mundo est profundamente preocupado em saber onde foram parar as centenas de tibetanos que foram presos ou desapareceram desde o m s de mar o deste ano e n s pedimos aos governantes ao redor do mundo que fa am press o em cima da china para que eles liberem todos os prisioneiros de consci ncia
7340175 um povo feliz milh es de chineses tomando as ruas e as avenidas n o houve nem um protesto nem repress o nem nada
7340176 um pa s socialista com um governo comunista um pa s que realizou milagres
7340177 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7340178 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7340179 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7340180 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7340181 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7340182 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7340183 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7340184 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7340185 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7340186 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7340187 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
7340188 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot
7340189 the some were from the places that have a stereotype about fox but when i asked them if they ever actually watched fox the answer is almost never
7340190 my sense is that there is a recognition that we cant ignore or give the back of our hand to the largest audience in cable television news
7340191 they have nothing to do with a progressive point of view
7340192 i dont think you would find anybody in the progressive movement who would say yes they are spokesmen for what we believe in
7340193 is a disaster at standing up for democrats that must be why fox hired him
7340194 without liberals and progressives to yell at without liberal positions to make fun of fox doesnt exist
7340195 people who know me know that im not a shrinking violet
7340196 i didnt sign up to be the guy who plays the harlem globetrotters
7340197 you can walk into a room where everybody agrees with you give a talk and everyone applauds you so you leave the room thinking youve accomplished something or you can go into a room filled with people who either havent made their minds up or disagree with you and try to open some minds
7340198 being on fox is like going into the second room
7340199 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
7340200 the guy was standing on my leg and then he got hold of my head i just pushed him away i was sitting on the ground the ref said i was sent off for violent conduct
7340201 what was i supposed to do i could not have pushed him higher than his waist im now going to miss three games and someone else will get a chance
7340202 i thought it was harsh he should have been given a talking to
7340203 the referee should have just got on with the game
7340204 i wanted a response on and off the ball and i got it the best side i e us did not win
7340205 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7340206 you cannot go into a 7 11 or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent oh im not joking
7340207 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7340208 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7340209 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7340210 i am a zionist you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
7340211 the fans are right behind us they care we all care its a real siege mentality
7340212 to coin a phrase he parkin held his hands up to the lads in the dressing room
7340213 it was important to win but it wont be something ill be writing home about
7340214 if i hadnt been able to win a game in the championship i would have been disgusted with myself with the players ive got
7340215 it was never a penalty i have watched the dvd and cannot understand how the referee came to his decision i have been to see the ref and given him my view
7340216 we all need picking up even the manager and nows the time for the players to show what theyre made of
7340217 we have a lot of young players and i have been very pleased with the level of commitment shown by them

7340419 grandin didnt talk until she was three and a half years old communicating her frustration instead by screaming peeping and humming
7340420 grandin has become a prominent author and speaker on the subject of autism because i have read enough to know that there are still many parents and yes professionals too who believe that once autistic always autistic this dictum has meant sad and sorry lives for many children diagnosed as i was in early life as autistic to these people it is incomprehensible that the characteristics of autism can be modified and controlled however i feel strongly that i am living proof that they can
7340421 even though she was considered weird in her young school years she eventually found a mentor who recognized her interests and abilities which she later expanded into becoming a successful livestock handling equipment designer one of very few in the world she has designed the facilities in which half the cattle are handled in the united states consulting for firms such as burger king mcdonalds swift and others

7340477 while gabriel was with the prophet s abu bakr passed by them gabriel said it is abu bakr the prophet s said o gabriel do you know him gabriel said he is in the heaven more famous than him on the earth the angels call him the discerner of quraysh he is your minister in your life and the caliph after your death
7340478 prophet muhammad s said the angels rejoiced at the birth of abu bakr allah swt looked at the garden of eden and said i swear by my glory and loftiness that i will not enter anyone into it except who loved this newborn baby

7340481 one day the prophet got out leaning on ali bin abu talib they met abu bakr and omar the prophet said to ali do you love these two men ali as said yes i do the prophet s said to ali as love them in order to enter paradise
7340482 i heard the prophet s saying allah swt has seventy thousand angels in the heaven cursing whoever curses abu bakr and omar
7340483 i heard the prophet s saying this is gabriel telling me from allah swt that whoever loves abu bakr and omar is a pious believer and whoever hates them is a rogue hypocrite
7340484 the prophet s said allah swt had created me of his light and created abu bakr of my light and created omar of the light of abu bakr and created my nation of omars light omar is the lamp of people in paradise

7340525 i trust mr darcy that you never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice but it is incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly
7340526 i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power not to concede my earlier judgment but my feelings will not be repressed anymore you must allow me to tell you how much i ardently admire and love the food at pylos it is decidedly worthy of ones affection and not beneath it

7340542 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

7340549 we scored two good goals on set pieces the pieces were set up because we were able to get behind the defense which is something we really tried to concentrate on last week
7340550 weve had some nailbiters so to come out and get a convincing win is important for us especially going on the road next weekend to carry that on
7340551 voy a morir y pedi perdon a dios por todo lo q habia hecho
7340552 there is not much to say i left a bit too early it was my fault and unfortunately i ran over the guy who was refuelling we need to look and see what really happened
7340553 i think it is amazing after such a bad result we come here with a new track which was new for everybody and we did just such a fantastic job from preparing the car on friday and saturday morning and choosing the right tyres
7340554 i think there is nothing more we can ask for especially after such a bad result but we still need to work very hard as today we had another problem with kimi and another one in the garage but it is nice that our mechanic is fine we need to look forward we have time to work and have so many important races in front of us i am just so glad and happy especially after such a disaster in hungary
7340555 the first stint was very good nothing special but very good so lewis was just fighting and every lap i was pulling away by a couple of tenths then the second stint i think we won the race there as the car was just perfect and was improving lap by lap it was amazing to see the gap increasing very reasonably then the last stint i think with the grip on the track the temperature i was on the soft tyre so i could manage to drive really in a relaxing way which sometimes is a big problem but i was doing similar lap times so it is amazing how the car behaved on the last stint the car was just perfect
7340556 yeah i think it wasnt very clever from his side as even if he went out in front of me he needed to let me by it was a shame to fight with him in the pit lane as we were very close and i needed to back off and i lost a lot of time but fortunately the gap was enough
7340557 well because i stopped behind him in the pit stop and we leave together when he was passing me by i was leaving the garage so we were side by side but i was the leader and he was lapping it was quite narrow and the wall was getting narrower and narrower so i didnt want to take the risk
7340558 yeah absolutely i cannot complain with second place we have had quite a strong weekend i have had a few problems health wise but still pulled through and had a great team behind me who helped me it is a nice new circuit and ive come here and got some good points and the team have got some good points this weekend so just overall it was a solid weekend for us
7340559 this track is not that physical it was just that it was hot you dont have enough water in the car really it has just been a very hot weekend and as you can see we are in these big old suits it is like driving in a sauna it is quite a hectic one and half hour race so i am pretty happy the way i got through
7340560 suddenly i couldnt steer any more for two corners and it was extremely dangerous and i have never had it before
7340561 i think the key for this podium was yesterday in qualifying i was just three tenths off pole with three laps more fuel than felipe i think it was an amazing performance yesterday i think today was our reality our real pace is a bit far away but we will try to do our best
7340562 well we need first of all to look at what had happened as i have no idea why kimi blew an engine we need to work very hard for the next race and we will see when it is important to use or not to use the joker if we really have a problem now we are working to fix the reliability as it has been an issue for us this year especially the first race last race and this race we need to work very deep and i am sure everybody is concentrating and working very hard to solve every problem that we have
7340563 even if i lost time or he is closing the gap you know that you have a great car that you dont need to do a lot just push a little bit harder improving the lap time it was just fantastic i think after such a bad result we did a fantastic job not 100 per cent as we still had a problem with kimis engine and we need to work very hard to fix that as it will be the key for the end of the championship but i think today we had everything perfect to win the race and to do a great job
7340564 we thought that lewis was a little bit heavier than me one or two laps not more than that in the worst case if it was two laps i think i needed three seconds in front of him and we were more than that
7340565 i didnt do anything wrong i just backed off i think if it is under investigation it is more for adrian because we went side by side when i saw him i expected him to back off as i was the leader and then he didnt so i backed off if it is under investigation it is nothing to do with me
7340566 no i cannot say anything i just went away he was on my side so i let him go and i passed him after thats it
7340567 no we assumed that he would either go in the same lap as us or perhaps maybe longer but it turned out we were actually two laps longer than them that was a good indication that we have had good pace all weekend and really showed we were strong this weekend i think throughout the race they seemed to show a little bit more pace on the longer stints i think we stayed pretty close in the first stint but i think towards the end he was edging away a little bit but however i was still really happy with the pace of my car and they fuelled me two laps longer it was unfortunate as i came out so close to felipe so perhaps if we were going the same lap as him maybe we would have come out a bit closer or had the chance to battle but this is racing and the great thing is we came away with some strong points for myself and for the team the great thing is we are showing that we have great reliability and that is due to all the team doing a fantastic job
7340568 yeah ive had a pretty miserable weekend really i had the flu when i arrived i had pretty hard fevers pretty much every day and low energy i also had quite a big problem with a spasm in my neck which kind of nearly did lead to me not racing this weekend
7340569 to race on i really enjoyed it i think the people here have done a fantastic job preparing it i think the weather has been great the atmosphere has been phenomenal the spanish people have been great i think also the marshals have done a fantastic job in clearing cars that have been off the track i think theyre probably the quickest i have ever seen in my whole racing career i was very impressed with that but just racing on the track was generally very good the track was very safe its difficult to overtake but thats formula one so i was happy
7340570 yeah it was in the middle of the first stint i think around lap eight
7340571 yeah but i still finished half a minute behind hamilton so its quite a big gap i think the key point of this weekend was just qualifying managing to put my car in third position third row it turned out today that we have even more fuel than the top two cars so it was quite a good achievement later in qualifying managing quite good laps and i think it was the key point otherwise if i started behind kimi and kovalainen most probably i would have finished behind them but i managed a good lap and here we are
7340572 well i will try im trying my best in the last race i also started on the second row but i finished much further behind im giving my maximum and im trying my best i believe everyone is trying their best but we have to be realistic and i think the true pace of our car is more similar to todays pace than yesterdays in qualifying we struggled a bit more than mclaren on the long stints most probably with new tyres i managed to pull something more the car is behaving better but as soon as the tyres get a bit used then the car starts sliding too much and you cannot do anything
7340573 i only had it once i just woke up very very early yesterday before 5 a m yesterday and i had the spasm in my neck fortunately ive got a great doctor who was with me the whole way through it it was so bad that i was struggling to basically stand up and so i had to have injections in my neck and take plenty of painkillers fortunately as i said i have a great trainer who helped pedro de la rosa was looking forward to racing
7340574 no i feel the same i always want to beat whichever driver on the track it doesnt matter if its my team mate or not so it doesnt change anything for me i always wanted to do my best and i did a lot of good results this season a lot of bad results as well but the mentality is the same
7340575 no it wont be a problem again im pretty sure its still sore it was probably something to do with my pillow the way i was sleeping because it was just when i woke up i think ive done a pretty decent job considering
7340576 i know a driver who brought his own pillow with him to every race
7340577 to be honest i dont want to go through these comments as i said i answered what happened at that moment for me it was completely normal we saw these things happen many times both cars going side by side down the pit lane so i would be really surprised if we see a penalty or whatever because its just racing
7340578 i think it looks pretty well balanced i think if you look at the whole field they all seem to be relatively close through qualifying but i think then the better car really does tend to look after its tyres a little bit better and has better longer stints so i think were both pretty close there perhaps theyre a little bit better during the race but i think in qualifying were quite close
7340579 i dont think it was too much of a disadvantage i think for sure everyone on the right did seem to get a better start and i noticed through the race i was actually driving on that side the pole side of the grid the whole time so it must have been the cleaner side but it sure looked that way at the start because felipe and heikki got better starts from looking in the mirror heikki jumped kimi is that right
7340580 no how many times do you see that i think a lot no if you follow formula one especially when everybody comes into the pit lane together its pretty normal to see two cars driving side by side in the pit lane so you have the line you need to respect the line were all going the same speed i dont think it was dangerous it was just unexpected from adrian because i was leading and i was beside him so in the worst case he needs to let me by in the first or second corner but it was not dangerous he just backed off so if i hadnt backed off he was going to back off otherwise were going to crash into the wall so one had to back off in this case it was me i left a margin because i didnt want to risk anything
7340581 well reliability is part of the consistency so if you have a single problem youre not consistent so the consistency is still the key for the championship and consistency means the performance the reliability and also the drivers so i think all these things are very important to the end of the season
7340582 as you can see reliability is the key and finishing and scoring points has got to be the goal for everyone im not worried about the reliability of my car as you can tell the past year and a half weve had phenomenal reliability and thats obviously due to the whole package that the whole team has put together and the engines great the car is great weve not really got any problems we can focus on developing the car rather than worrying about reliability which is a bonus for us

7340723 i remember when i was single i would sit smugly watching my friends and family raise their children wrong thats right i said wrong i could so clearly and easily see all the things they were doing improperly i couldnt understand why they were failing at parenting i could tell that it was all very simple it was absolutely striking to me that they never made a game plan or set rules that they would stick to as parents what they were doing was going to cause their kids to become super freaks and it seemed i was the only one that knew it do you know what kind of burden that was to carry at some point i realized that i must for the good of the coming generations of parents start keeping mental notes of all the egregious errors that were made by those around me after all with all the mistakes they were making there was surely going to be enough creepy street mimes and fountain pen repairmen in the world my list was constantly fed new my kid will never do that notes things like i will never let my kid run around like an unruly maniac or i will never let them watch tv as small children and one i swore to no sugar for my kids all those poor terrible parents i pitied them it was a good thing that god put me here on earth so when i was a mom i could raise my children as glorious civilized citizens of our world an example to all those that followed behind me would be blessed to learn from my impeccable parenting forging the way would be so worth it i thought of all the innocent children i could save from becoming adults that enjoyed their jobs testing hemorrhoid creams i am not sure when but something has happened that caused me to veer away from my world of black and white parenting reality my parenting resume only has a year and a half of experience on it and i am certain i have allowed witness faith breaking every single one of my near holy rules its amazing that i have all but forgotten them as i tell my single friends about my adventures with faith there are often noticeable moments of silence during those pauses i am certain that i hear a pencil scratching paper as they add a new bullet point to their my kid will never do that list today in my world of reality i watched faith run around the house screaming at the top of her lungs hit our dog throw a toy at her sister scream at me pee through her diaper onto her sundress get a buger on on the back of her hand and play with it and cry when i tried to wipe her new friend off spit out chewed food just to pick it up and eat it five minutes later put her hand on a poopy diaper i had just set down yell at my knee i know it was really weird to me too the cellulite around it must have offended her run to the corner of the room and squat down while making grunting noises loud enough to alert the neighbors she was pooping and then there was the multiple attempts of eating nuggets of dog food and this was just today as i admit that i am not the mother i swore i would be i have to laugh with a heart that has the warm and fuzzies i am not perfect but i know i am doing the best that i can sometimes i may question my parenting skills but i feel certain that the love and laughter in our home will help our kids turn out ok i now understand and must declare humbly that i stand corrected to all those i unjustly judged you did are doing a great job the very best you can in several years when we run into each other and i tell you faith writes for cereal boxes and you tell me your grown child tests bee keeper suits we will understand one another we raised them wrong crazy and not by the book but we will be proud of the job we have done knowing that we loved and laughed as often as we could through all the mistakes

7340779 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7340780 once im through with it all it would be my obligation to spread the game
7340781 if travelling india and interacting with the youngsters helps the cause i would love to do that
7340782 if production is not increased there may be problems as milk consumption in india is growing due to rising income of the population
7340783 we are targeting to increase 10 000 hectare under cocoa production every year however this year the acreage is going to increase by 15 000 hectares
7340784 the success of the beijing olympic games is attributable to the concerted efforts of the chinese people and people from the rest of the world
7340785 the glory goes to the olympic family to athletes who have competed hard to volunteers from different parts of the world and to friends across the world who have been involved in the games in various ways
7340786 a grand event of international sports competition and cultural exchanges
7340787 it was a matter of being in the right place at the right time
7340788 i will say this twice i will say this twice
7340789 the lightweight fully enclosed 7 speed gear system is linked to diamondbacks 7005 hydro formed and cnc machined frameset
7340790 war war changes all the time during the sunrise of our nature our ancestors learned the murder of sticks and stones but we now use more complex things the weapons that kill themselves mankind has created effective weapon that in the end she exterminated herself now i have only one and i am just a voice of the game playing in the games war that does not change when it is clearly required in the pit next to a shopping center is a new type of human diseases caused by the sick panda 42 groove is closed he was born and raised here you are here hero of prophecy to predict our people to lead the world to recreate the grooves possible living in the basement of medication changes
7340791 its a tradition from the indian sub continent to prepare a fresh paan in front of the customer according to their requirements
7340792 if shopkeepers are not allowed to do that they will suffer a lot of smaller businesses are not aware of the consultation
7340793 anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority it thus exemplifies the purpose behind the bill of rights and of the first amendment in particular to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation at the hand of an intolerant society
7340794 news reporters enjoy a qualified privilege derived from the first amendment guarantee of a free press to withhold from discovery in a civil case confidential or non confidential sources materials or other information where such discovery would impinge on the ability of the media to gather and disseminate news said privilege may be defeated in a particular case where the party seeking discovery can demonstrate that the testimony material or information sought is relevant enough and otherwise unavailable to outweigh the first amendment interest of the media a balancing analysis is the benchmark
7340795 i will lead the all party delegation to prime minister manmohan singh and finance minister p chidambaram requesting for the special status to goa
7340796 the industries are reluctant to come to goa as they chose hp and uttaranchal as their destination
7340797 i havent really talked to anyone at this point in time to be honest with you
7340798 im sure that jerry reese and i and ownership will look long and hard at whatever options there are out there and do whats best at this point in time
7340799 the only thing ive talked to michael about is his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment
7340800 i have not had a chance to talk to anyone to talk to any of the players or kiwi or anyone this afternoon
7340801 until i do that ill just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7340802 he believed we were enforcing immigration laws at the time he probably was not aware that he was going to have to own up to the crimes hed committed in his country
7340803 jammie pants fluffy bunny slippers and a half empty box of gallo looks like someones got the blues or in this case a lack thereof
7340804 this job is perfect for me because i dont have a very long attention span and i love to try new things like
7340805 i will trot down a street like abbot kinney in venice and leave a note and my business card at a storefront thats under construction
7340806 our hits tripled within three days after we were on dailycandy
7340807 my sales director got calls from buyers at other stores too
7340808 tyra banks came in because she saw us on dailycandy
7340809 we did like 12 000 in sales on our first day of business which is amazing
7340810 they definitely like to be first to write about something and get exclusive deals for their readers
7340811 look you dont want to get on the wrong side of the dailycandy girls
7340812 theyre perfectly nice but they like to get their way
7340813 but my biggest fear is that someone will read something i wrote about and say i already knew that
7340814 we want to keep the content fresh and our readers are already so savvy
7340815 the walls were still being painted when i sat in the store with the writer and told her what would be there
7340816 i was nervous but you dont want to say no to dailycandy
7340817 that said some of us are growing old and i am one of them
7340818 obama will be the nominee the five percent of clinton supporters who are bitter have to grow up admire hillary as we do the issue is not a cult but a candidacy that can win
7340819 if youre a progressive democrat and you lose an election you pick yourself up unite and governor you dont whine and kvetch
7340820 we are used to the river rising so it is no big deal
7340821 i left this morning i spent the night and watch the water come up and saw what kind of damage had been done
7340822 i brought almost everything out that is valuable everything is is tied down
7340823 i am watching it get higher seeing what is does
7340824 its great to be home i have to tell you
7340825 when we were last here i think we were probably on show 20 of this tour and i honestly thought it was going to be a three month tour and here we are two years later you are going to be the recipients of 103 shows experience
7340826 i want to remember him in his days of just undiluted glory
7340827 then you turn to vietnam reading the minutes of the meetings talking to people you have a sense of a man who didnt know what to do if i write this book correctly that contrast will emerge
7340828 i said to him if you really want to do this you have to go back and get your notes on the delegates and what went on out there and talk to me in detail
7340829 these were long hours of interviews you feel youre sitting there and you are a hearing a story that with everything everybody thinks they know about american politics nobody knows this story
7340830 he was very pale and thin and it was harder and harder for him to breathe
7340831 began to be realized when civil rights act of 1964
7340832 but you cant talk about iraq without talking about vietnam
7340833 you cant leave that out his presidency did not end in triumph
7340834 every generation pays very close attention to the major controversies of the time and when johnson left office in 1969 vietnam was still raging and a lot of americans were furious at johnson
7340835 they werent thinking about a lot of things they had liked about him like and in 1969 people were not as aware as historians are now of the efforts he made to get the country out of the war
7340836 the sense of that seems to be very much lost
7340837 im sure the maras tisches and jerry reese will look long and hard at all of our available options
7340838 estamos haciendo un gran esfuerzo para cambiar la opini n negativa que del cond n existe en la sociedad india
7340839 ms bynes was driving a bmw when she made an unsafe turn and hit another car hit her
7340840 it was determined that she was at fault but no crime was committed
7340841 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7340842 the games are not just a showcase for the worlds best competitions and athletes they help break barriers and overcome differences the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7340843 leading to major advances in the areas of energy consumption sustainable water consumption waste management and air quality the legacy of these games for china is ultimately up to the chinese people
7340844 it was absolutely amazing to be here with the crowds and thinking all the world is watching
7340845 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7340846 we realize that mistakes have been made but were excited in florida
7340847 we had the guts to take the system on and we made progress this year
7340848 in der sommerpause ist es wichtig zumindest einen tag im auto zu verbringen
7340849 f r einen rennfahrer kann es nicht gut sein f nf wochen lang nicht im wagen zu sitzen
7340850 in nogaro haben wir besonders an zwei punkten gearbeitet n mlich an der entwicklung des fahrzeugs sowie am chassis setup
7340851 nogaro nimmt die reifen sehr stark ran und hat viele verschiedene kurventypen
7340852 daher ist es f r testarbeit aller art besonders geeignet und nicht zuletzt auch f r unterschiedliche rennstrategien
7340853 we are maintaining our own but not making huge progress
7340854 10 hits of cocaine for every senior high school student in the us
7340855 us drug policy is something of a disaster in terms of any concrete results or progress
7340856 given iraq afghanistan and the war on terror they completely walked away from latin american policy
7340857 these narcotics traffickers much like terrorists in other parts of the world are learning adversaries
7340858 meet under the statue of stalin at 11 a m
7340859 georgians shot at us and now i live on the street how can we ever live peacefully with them
7340860 we are a small country europe doesnt listen to us but russia does
7340861 look what they did to our city they stole our things kidnapped men and killed children
7340862 we know how much people have suffered i hope we will see peace for many generations to come
7340863 we were criticized the last couple years for telling people that the chinese would have a very very strong team
7340864 weve seen that come through on the gold medal count its not something that were pleased with we certainly believe that our country is capable of winning the gold medal count
7340865 were succeeding in virtually every team sport that weve had here
7340866 we knew it would be difficult but we continued to invest resources in those sports its important to our country we will not abandon those sports in an attempt to turn medals in individual sports
7340867 its hard to figure out who to blame for the food crisis
7340868 social investment has been most influential when there was an actor that could be identified e g the tobacco companies the south african apartheid regime etc but the causes of the global food crisis are multifaceted thats probably why you havent seen a coherent response from the social investment community
7340869 a lot of sr funds are interested in the issue but have not yet found the grounds on which theyre going to engage different private sector actors who could have an influence either positively or negatively on the food crisis
7340870 the mobilization of capital for agricultural growth especially in the small farm economy definitely cannot come only from the public sector
7340871 so the private sector has a very important role to play in order to mitigate and overcome the current food crisis
7340872 when that happened i thought wow there probably are things i could learn about safety
7340873 i havent been on a bike in years and even when i did it wasnt in traffic
7340874 im getting hammered by mayors asking what are you doing about all these new bikers on the street and nobody knows the rules of the road
7340875 says robert raburn executive director of the east bay bicycle coalition in oakland when the organization started classes in 2003 it offered maybe two a year now it has six slated for september with two more to be announced
7340876 biking kind of gives me a sense of independence im not dependent on fossil fuels
7340877 what we are really pushing for is more education both for cyclers and cars we have cyclists riding down wrong ways in bike lanes and drivers not looking when they are turning or opening doors
7340878 im in favor of this idaho rolling stop rule because you dont have to come to a complete stop to be completely safe
7340879 on a bicycle you are only really endangering yourself when you speed through an intersection while thats certainly not true when you are in a car
7340880 our typical candidate is a mom who wants a little more flexibility and balance
7340881 she wants to put her child on the bus in the morning work several hours and meet her childs bus in the afternoon
7340882 a lot of companies use it as a strategy to retain valuable employees
7340883 the need for part time positions is becoming more acute because we have so many retirees now
7340884 it can be very difficult to get a good part time job make sure you have it in hand before you retire
7340885 they value personal time a lot higher than baby boomers do
7340886 the majority of my friends who took on salaried positions are in no better shape than i am
7340887 often when people request a reduction in their schedule it triggers assumptions that they wont be as effective
7340888 supervisors will say i dont want a part timer working for me it used to be fairly difficult for employees to sue employers for matters related to flexible work scheduling or reduced hours were starting to see some plaintiffs becoming more successful
7340889 it requires more effort and more planning on the part of management
7340890 smaller businesses are definitely more open minded in their policies
7340891 if i were hiring and an ace candidate came in and wanted to work 20 hours id be foolish to turn that candidate down
7340892 youll see a lot more organizations having to adjust their hiring practices
7340893 tab mix plus update problems with firefox 3 0 1
7340894 allt som du g r blir till p rlor p min panna
7340895 its basically turned it into a viable christmas or birthday present
7340896 i like to play because it teaches us discipline it teaches us to work with people older than us
7340897 its a positive physical activity rather than sitting in front of their xboxes
7340898 rather than sit there and pretend to be shooting people on a television theyre outside actually learning teamwork and how to react under stress
7340899 the guns look and function similarly to real firearms unfortunately in this society firearms have a bad reputation
7340900 if a police officer saw something that resembled a real firearm the best scenario is the gun would be taken away the worst scenario is the kid would get shot thats our nightmare
7340901 this is not just something you buy and let the kids go anywhere you cant go in the middle of the street with this stuff
7340902 no ones ever gotten shot so hard they got hurt
7340903 just have a good time and hang out with some friends
7340904 to learn how to use a sword one must first master when to use a sword
7340905 guillaume hiron a vu son coup franc finir sa course sur la transversale haytillonne
7340906 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7340907 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7340908 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7340909 she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 percent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7340910 but obama felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7340911 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about childcare and figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7340912 v ctima de una campa a fuera de lugar chapucera amenazadora

7340914 les guste o no nuestra solidaridad les ha permitido superarnos en calidad de vida y es de mal nacidos no reconocerlo
7340915 el expolio fiscal que sufre catalunya es tan excesivo que permite que ciudadanos de la rioja o extremadura reciban m s euros en inversi n sanitaria que los catalanes

7340931 the fascist direction this country has taken should be brought to a halt and it can only be done by conscious activism by people living in this country saying we will no longer go along with the things done by the bush administration
7340932 that was a last minute change and it does present a challenge in that it came about at the last minute
7340933 its really just a matter of relying on the partnerships that were already in place using the same resources to put the event together on somewhat short notice for invesco field
7340934 the future of the next few days is unwritten but the level to which the secret service the federal government and the city of denver have already gone to interfere with the free speech rights of protestors is unprecedented
7340935 maurice just spent it all for them on getting to work and back every day
7340936 this seems to me a classic case of the national party giving with one hand and taking away with the other
7340937 so youre probably talking about 20 percent of the new project and relative to the rest of the roading network its sort of less than 2 or 3 percent
7340938 the union will not be wasting any more time or resources on nationals legal challenges
7340939 i would just like to let people know its possible for the ministry to make mistakes
7340940 i would feel completely distraught i can read what this guy has been up to when hes been in court when he was sentenced what happened to him and everything

7340948 i am sure i can still improve my qualifying and my results
7340949 there is still a long way to go so lets wait and see what happens
7340950 i think i can do better than that so i am trying to improve
7340951 i left the pits a bit too early it was my fault and unfortunately i ran over the guy who was refuelling we need to look and see what really happened
7340952 sure it was not a good day but these things happen in racing i am not too worried i still think i can come back this season
7340953 it was not a great weekend but it is not the first time we are in a bit of a worse situation in the championship but if we get all the things sorted then i think we still have a chance to come back
7340954 we know what the issues have been but unfortunately we havent been able to sort them out hopefully now in the next test we can work a bit and try to find the solution for it if we get the qualifying right it will help a lot
7340955 we still have faith in him of course he is a world champion and we are a loyal team

7340981 of clues and causes a methodological interpretation of origin of life studies
7340982 abundantly clear the boards intelligent design id policy violates the establishment clause in making this determination we have addressed the seminal question of whether id is science we have concluded that it is not and moreover that id cannot uncouple itself from its creationist and thus religious antecedents
7340983 intelligent design is fundamentally unscientific it cannot be tested as scientific theory because its central conclusion is based on belief in the intervention of a supernatural agent
7340984 id is not science and cannot be adjudged a valid accepted scientific theory as it has failed to publish in peer reviewed journals engage in research and testing and gain acceptance in the scientific community
7340985 it is critical to preserve the integrity of science education by opposing the mandatory teaching in science classes of creationism intelligent design and other concepts not based on sound scientific principles

7341223 da war eine stille wie ich sie selten erlebt habe
7341224 jetzt m ssen wir die drei punkte in cottbus zur ck holen
7341225 da haben wir uns viel zu passiv verhalten wichtige zweik mpfe verloren und uns viel zu weit nach hinten dr ngen lassen
7341226 es ist rgerlich aber es geht weiter wir werden wieder gas geben
7341227 dass eine steigerung gegen ber dem letzten jahr da ist
7341228 die mannschaft kniet sich rein wir spielen aggressiven fu ball das sind wir den fans und dem verein schuldig
7341229 lo que se requiere es que todos los del gobierno se comprometan a dar soluciones satisfactorias la sociedad tiene que hacer la parte que le corresponda
7341230 el problema de las cumbres es que se habla mucho y en el momento no generan soluciones lo que hay que hacer es que cada uno tome su responsabilidad y act e para encontrar la respuestas favorables
7341231 es la preocupaci n n mero uno de todos los mexicanos pero se tiene que hacer algo dr stico porque hemos sufrido demasiado
7341232 por encima de todo buscaba a un l der que estuviera listo a tomar el cargo de presidente hoy volv a springfield a decirles que encontr a ese l der
7341233 un hombre con una trayectoria distinguida un hombre decente y ese hombre es joe biden
7341234 durante d cadas l ha cambiado a washington pero washington nunca lo ha cambiado a l
7341235 estoy orgulloso de estar al lado del pr ximo presidente de estados unidos
7341236 venimos de diferentes lugares pero compartimos una historia com n una historia estadounidense
7341237 mi madre y mi padre me educaron dici ndome algo que mi padre repet a poco importa la cantidad de ca das lo importante es la rapidez con la que te levantas
7341238 se oras y se ores es la historia de ustedes es la historia de estados unidos
7341239 el senador obama se mantiene fiel a las mejores tradiciones de la vicepresidencia seleccionando un l der excepcionalmente fuerte y experimentado as como un funcionario dedicado
7341240 el senador biden ser un vicepresidente din mico y resuelto que ayudar al senador obama tanto a ganar la presidencia como a gobernar este gran pa s
7341241 ustedes tienen al primer candidato afroamericano que representa al ciudadano medio sabe hablar es brillante y limpio y es un tipo apuesto
7341242 puede estar listo pero ahora mismo no creo que lo est la presidencia no es algo que pueda aprenderse sobre la marcha
7341243 no ha habido hasta ahora peor cr tico de la falta de experiencia de barack obama que el propio joe biden
7341244 im trying not to talk like were going to tear em up
7341245 nc state didnt pay him a whole bunch of money if they didnt think he was one of the best coaches in the country
7341246 coach obriens offense has never been that much of a quarterback run oriented offense
7341247 weve been working on defending against quarterback runs in the pre season and well continue doing that until the game and through the game
7341248 i just think its a good game for us and for them nc state
7341249 in a very difficult situation by some angry folks who somehow want to make a statement that need not be made
7341250 went to the democratic congressional campaign committee and we endorsed senator obama and praised senator clinton as she deserved to be praised the next day the state senate where my son is a senator and the state assembly had a press conference in new york endorsing senator obama my son is an elected obama delegate im an appointed superdelegate then my son and i
7341251 after all that how do i then not vote for senator obama at any moment at the convention
7341252 everybody knows how well hillary did how close the race was how much she means to this party and this country how important she is to the senat and she is speaking primetime
7341253 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7341254 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7341255 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7341256 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7341257 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7341258 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7341259 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7341260 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7341261 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7341262 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7341263 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7341264 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7341265 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7341266 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7341267 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7341268 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7341269 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7341270 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7341271 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7341272 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7341273 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7341274 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7341275 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7341276 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7341277 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7341278 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7341279 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7341280 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7341281 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7341282 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7341283 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7341284 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7341285 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7341286 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7341287 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7341288 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7341289 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7341290 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7341291 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7341292 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7341293 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7341294 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7341295 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7341296 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7341297 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7341298 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7341299 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7341300 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7341301 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7341302 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7341303 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7341304 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7341305 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7341306 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7341307 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7341308 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7341309 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7341310 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7341311 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7341312 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7341313 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7341314 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7341315 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7341316 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7341317 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7341318 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7341319 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7341320 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7341321 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7341322 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7341323 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7341324 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7341325 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7341326 anton has not renegotiated his contract and the decision was taken out of my hands
7341327 i dont know where anton is in terms of signing for sunderland but once the club accept the bid it moves on
7341328 football is about winning it doesnt matter how well you play so long as you come off the pitch having picked up the points
7341329 when you dont play as well as you know you can but you are still getting results then that is a sign of a good team
7341330 and thats been our stand we have been very consistent in supporting the commitments he has made to the 2007 forum in tonga so this is not australia and new zealand this is the forums stand that we continue to urge him to meet the commitment that he has pledged
7341331 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7341332 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7341333 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7341334 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7341335 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7341336 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7341337 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7341338 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
7341339 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
7341340 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7341341 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7341342 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7341343 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7341344 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7341345 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7341346 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7341347 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7341348 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7341349 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7341350 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7341351 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7341352 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7341353 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7341354 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7341355 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7341356 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7341357 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7341358 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7341359 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7341360 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7341361 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7341362 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7341363 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7341364 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7341365 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7341366 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7341367 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7341368 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7341369 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7341370 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7341371 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7341372 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7341373 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7341374 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7341375 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7341376 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7341377 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7341378 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7341379 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7341380 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7341381 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7341382 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7341383 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7341384 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7341385 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

7341388 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7341389 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7341390 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7341391 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7341392 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7341393 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7341394 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7341395 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7341396 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7341397 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7341398 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7341399 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7341400 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7341401 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

7341407 we have started with two wins but we are very early into the season if it was the last two games of the season then it would be different
7341408 the top teams only lose two or three games a season and we have missed an outstanding chance
7341409 chelsea have had a bad day in my opinion but one piece of brilliance by deco has won it for them
7341410 chelsea didnt at any stage look like they were going to romp it like they did against portsmouth last week our keeper has hardly had a save to make

7341425 in the largest study of its kind researchers found that having people pray for heart bypass surgery patients had no effect on their recovery in fact patients who knew they were being prayed for had a slightly higher rate of complications
7341426 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7341427 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7341428 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7341429 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7341430 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7341431 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7341432 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7341433 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7341434 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

7341438 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7341439 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
7341440 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
7341441 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7341442 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7341443 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7341444 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7341445 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7341446 hes this scrappy irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7341447 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down

7341454 that will allow people to visually tie the pedestrian areas together from the landscaping and bring all the projects together
7341455 soaring transport costs first on importing iron to china and then exporting finished steel overseas have already more than eroded the wage advantage and suddenly rendered chinese made steel uncompetitive in the us market chinas steel exports to the us are now falling by more than 20 on a year over year basis the worst performance in almost a decade while many might attribute this decline to the slowdown in the us economy it is noteworthy that us domestic steel production has risen by almost 10 during the same period
7341456 shipping a standard 40 foot container from shanghai to the us eastern seaboard now costs 8 000 in 2000 when oil prices were 20 per barrel it only cost 3 000 to ship the container but at 200 per barrel it will soon cost 15 000 in transport costs to ship from china to the us eastern seaboard
7341457 instead of finding cheap labor half way around the world the key will be to find the cheapest labor force within reasonable shipping distance to your market it seems that american importers are starting to do the math while the pace of shipments from china to the us is slowing mainly among freight intensive goods even non energy mexican imports to the us are still rising at a healthy annual rate of more than 7 and interestingly the goods that have seen the fastest growth are the ones that on average are more freight intensive and directly compete with china such as furniture iron and steel rubber and paper products in a world of triple digit oil prices distance costs money and while trade liberalization and technology have flattened the world rising transport prices will once again make it rounder

7341470 the prisoners underwent medical examination they were interviewed by red cross representatives and they will be transferred tomorrow to the beituniya checkpoint
7341471 our reception of the prisoners tomorrow will be like a national wedding
7341472 releasing these kinds of prisoners indicates that the criteria israel used in the past will not endure this clears the way for other prisoners
7341473 israeli establishment went bankrupt having no answer to the solid and strong information on the al aqsa institutions activities in regards to the damage caused to the holy sites in general and to the al aqsa mosque in particular

7341479 we have very big strategic plans in iraq which include electricity and oil and the refineries and also other factories which will bring good benefits to iraq

7341482 ongoing efforts to create positive and lasting peace in the region and progress towards the shared goal of a peace agreement in 2008
7341483 there is some kind of expectation of doing something before the end of the year
7341484 i believe that the timeline is important but what is more important is the content and the nature of the understanding that we can reach with the palestinians
7341485 this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence
7341486 we are getting information that they are still in captivity but their whereabouts are unknown
7341487 we dont have any concrete information on the kidnappers or where they have been taken but we are trying to find out how they are
7341488 some of the information we are getting so far indicates that the journalists were kidnapped by freelance militias who want a ransom
7341489 we went to the area and found out that the bombardment was very heavy lots of houses have been destroyed and more than 90 noncombatants including women children and elderly people have died
7341490 they have claimed that taliban were there they must prove it

7341492 once again the enemies of islam have stained their hands with the blood of innocent people we the muslim nation will not accept their apologies this time
7341493 the afghan government has frequently emphasized not harming civilians but unfortunately it has not been listened to very well
7341494 extends the concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death to include equivalent years of healthy life lost by virtue of being in states of poor health or disability
7341495 the 2008 epi provides policymakers and environmental experts an empirically grounded basis for comparing the environmental performance of nearly 150 countries worldwide
7341496 overall there were many more high performing countries in the environmental health arena than in ecosystem vitality sixty six countries had scores of 90 or above in environmental health whereas only two scored above 90 in ecosystem vitality unlike ecosystem vitality environmental health is highly correlated with wealth indicating that many of the low performing countries have not made the requisite investment in baseline environmental amenities
7341497 the epi provides a powerful tool for steering environmental investments refining policy choices optimizing the impact of limited financial resources and understanding the determinants of policy results
7341498 despite improvements data gaps remain a very serious obstacle to a more refined epi and to data driven policymaking more generally many countries particularly in the developing world lack data on a number of critical indicators
7341499 as expected developed countries with significant financial resources for environmental management make up a large portion of top performers
7341500 costa rica a middle income country outperforms many developed countries as well as its neighbors

7341507 money enhanced individualism but diminished communal motivations an effect that is still apparent in peoples responses today
7341508 if part of this plan fuels inflation a way must be found to prevent this or control any negative aspects
7341509 blocking dangerous trends of western intoxication and secularism which were infiltrating the countrys administration
7341510 but the current governments characteristics mean it has warmer support
7341511 some domineering countries and their worthless followers want to get their own way with the iranian nation but the nation the president and the government have stood up to them
7341512 adopting an aggressive spirit against world bullies is a sign of the governments loyalty to revolutionary slogans and discourse
7341513 you have imposed sanctions on us but today young people in this land do not need your help to have a satellite carrying missile
7341514 we are delighted with the cmas historic resolution which we believe will greatly enhance the depth and breadth to of the saudi capital market this development will undoubtedly increase foreign capital inflows to the kingdoms stock market promote greater transparency reduce volatility associated with dominance of the retail investors in the saudi market and encourage more comprehensive equity research on listed companies
7341515 there is huge demand from international investors for entry into the kingdoms markets the tadawul saudi arabias stock exchange has the largest number of blue chip companies in the middle east a market capitalization that stands around 500 billion constituting approximately 1 percent of the capitalization of the global equity markets deutsche bank is fully prepared to offer its international clients its services in the kingdom as we have worked for a long time at establishing the necessary platform and mechanism
7341516 the opening up of the kingdoms markets to international investors will herald a new era for the strongest and largest economy in the middle east and we applaud the regulators vision in allowing international investors a golden opportunity to access a very attractive well diversified and the largest equity market in the region at a time of turmoil across international exchanges
7341517 foreigners have been waiting a long time for this step
7341518 the market is reacting to the news at 8 000 points the market is very low and a lot of stocks are trading at good value
7341519 these dangers will always remain as long as we do not pay them the necessary attention
7341520 ramadan abdullah shalh a leader of the palestinian islamic jihad movement arrived here on sunday for an inter palestinian dialogue that will be hosted by egypt in the coming few days
7341521 there are no ruptures between the two parties but issues to resolve
7341522 if a war were to happen as they are threatening our victory this time will be decisive unquestionable and final
7341523 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hizbullah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hizbullah
7341524 there are currently elections within kadima israels ruling political party and each candidate is trying to portray himself as the leader and the savior
7341525 the israelis speak about the lebanese governments policy statement and say the government has adopted the resistance and has given hizbullah an umbrella
7341526 this is ridiculous because the former governments policy statement was stronger in supporting the resistance than the present one yet zionist leaders did not say that it gave cover to the resistance
7341527 the five units will be destroyed in our mountains and valleys and homes and villages
7341528 and with it will be destroyed your country that is violating our sacred land
7341529 there was no crossing of the israeli army through the blue line
7341530 we had peacekeepers in the area and they confirmed it
7341531 they were just at the technical fence and this is not a violation
7341532 were protesting all the violations from both sides the only way we have is to protest the violations through diplomatic measures
7341533 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament
7341534 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7341535 the alliance is intact today but its future depends on the fulfillment of the promise zardari made for the restoration of the judges
7341536 we have directed our militants to stop attacks against the government and security forces in bajaur from today
7341537 the jirga elders council insisted that taliban should stop fighting in the interest of the people of bajaur
7341538 we are ready for talks with the government and the truce is an important development toward dialogue
7341539 we do not believe in their verbal commitments if they are sincere they should first surrender
7341540 five militants were killed in the mortar fire targeting suspected militant hideouts
7341541 this is why it is important to reconstruct these towns
7341542 the issue is that they had 36 checkpoints in tariq al jdideh and this is too much
7341543 there is a kind of exaggeration in the use of power against one group of people
7341544 the army and security forces are banned from entering some areas this is like selective security
7341545 we could not believe it when we saw the shore
7341546 it was one small step for humankind and one giant step for palestine
7341547 this is a symbolic mission and the idea is to break the siege
7341548 israel should have no right to control the movement of palestinians
7341549 but im in israeli society and i have to choose my battles

7341553 we should get done with the electoral law this way we will be left with the issue of agreeing on a defense strategy for lebanon
7341554 the defense strategy will be discussed during upcoming dialogue sessions
7341555 the new army chief will be appointed from a list of favorites that was constructed according to specific technical and military criteria
7341556 only a policy of non alignment is capable of protecting lebanon
7341557 i called for reconciliation in tripoli to prevent the syrian regime from using such a pretext
7341558 we call for abolishing the sponsor system and for adopting a system similar to advanced countries
7341559 the only people who benefit from the sponsor system are the visa traders who use their influence to maintain the status quo
7341560 just an amazing finish to an amazing season from a bunch of amazing guys
7341561 kens insightful passion has meant so much to youth baseball in long beach on so many levels
7341562 there is no one more responsible for its current health than ken

7341568 and in the next game against tucson we had to use our center fielder brett harper to pitch and he came through for us and we won and then we beat victoria 10 7 to qualify for the pony league world series
7341569 there might have been a language barrier but that didnt keep the kids from getting along terrifically and playing together including in video games
7341570 one of the kids we became particularly close to was hu chih wei a very likable young man he was the one who gave up the home run to oliver van buskirk
7341571 he was pretty distraught after the game but back at the hotel later he displayed a sense of humor about it when he saw oliver he smiled and did a home run pantomime with his arms it was funny and yet touching
7341572 vodafone is talking to barclays and icici bank for introducing two monthly schemes for six and 12 months
7341573 we expect to sell anywhere between 50 to 100 phones a day
7341574 however it is too early to predict how the sales will shape up
7341575 we will only be able to figure out the trend only after a week or so the response has been overwhelming but its still not clear how many of the pre bookings will actually convert to sales
7341576 we were selling the 3g version till a few days ago for anything between rs 40 000 to rs 55 000 there will always be people who will spend anything the older 2g version sold for around rs 24 000 25 000 now we will have to undercut

7341591 i talked to him when he was in the locker room in the training room
7341592 obviously he was down its unfortunate when any injury occurs but hopefully it is nothing serious and he will not miss any time
7341593 it looked like he was turning the corner and just kind of took an awkward step
7341594 the turf is hard and playing at that speed on that edge you can tweak things
7341595 you are always concerned any time a player like that goes down

7341631 on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades will not prevail against it
7341632 we knew jorge would have to leave the united states at some point but our belief was that all the paperwork was in order
7341633 we didnt foresee this happening by any means but we have to stick to the letter of the law
7341634 jorge is a special player if we felt that this trip was more of a risky situation we would have held him back
7341635 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber

7341642 hopefully this is a warning to some degree to lenders in indiana that we want them to be fair with indiana consumers
7341643 these are people that were told if you sell your home youre not going to have to pay a prepayment penalty
7341644 we hope that they borrowers will file a complaint with the indiana attorney generals office and they may then become part of this lawsuit

7341650 words which sound exactly alike but are spelled differently and have different meanings
7341651 if you want to teach english abroad heres what you need to know
7341652 business schools are heavily oriented toward teaching students hard skills but equally important is cultural intelligence
7341653 the point of the class is to teach people cultural intelligence
7341654 its important that students learn how to switch their behaviour in order to be effective and seen as competent in the workplace
7341655 i signed up for it and thought it would be a nice easy class
7341656 i had no idea it would expand my understanding of culture
7341657 but i also stress that theres variation around the average
7341658 the scenario was what soft skills would employees from endeca north america need to blend in to a japanese culture
7341659 a lot of business dealings happen outside the office at a client dinner on the golf course or on the tennis court
7341660 and its important that you know the rules about interacting with people what to expect how to conduct yourself and how you should expect to be treated
7341661 drinking is a social tradition and russian businessmen use it to gauge who theyre dealing with
7341662 they believe that ones true personality may be exposed and they learn whether they can trust you theres generally no excuse to refuse a drink or food in russia
7341663 it will allow me to feel more comfortable and confident
7341664 the mind is like a parachute it works only when it is open
7341665 burn her at the stake burn her at the stake
7341666 i believe so its really a day to day situation right now
7341667 just from my past experiences with things like this i didnt feel anything different than what i was thinking that it was just a sprain
7341668 its just one of those things that when you have an injury after the game you get a little sore after that it starts feeling a lot better
7341669 i just have to see how it goes here over the next couple of weeks and ill have a better feel for it
7341670 portion of a city in which members of a minority group live especially because of social legal or economic pressure
7341671 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7341672 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7341673 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7341674 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7341675 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7341676 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7341677 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7341678 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7341679 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7341680 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7341681 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7341682 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7341683 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7341684 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7341685 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7341686 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7341687 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7341688 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7341689 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7341690 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7341691 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7341692 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7341693 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7341694 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7341695 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7341696 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7341697 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7341698 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7341699 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7341700 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7341701 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7341702 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7341703 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7341704 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7341705 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7341706 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7341707 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7341708 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7341709 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7341710 this is a planning took where all things are going
7341711 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7341712 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7341713 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7341714 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7341715 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7341716 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7341717 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7341718 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7341719 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7341720 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7341721 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7341722 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7341723 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7341724 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7341725 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7341726 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7341727 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7341728 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7341729 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7341730 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7341731 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7341732 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7341733 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7341734 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7341735 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7341736 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7341737 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7341738 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7341739 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7341740 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7341741 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7341742 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7341743 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7341744 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7341745 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7341746 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7341747 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7341748 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7341749 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7341750 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7341751 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7341752 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7341753 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7341754 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7341755 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7341756 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7341757 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7341758 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7341759 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7341760 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7341761 if you dont like the way we do things here maybe you should find another church
7341762 not be about religion religiosity but about a personal relationship with jesus
7341763 the way we do things here which are not to be questioned or debated
7341764 our religious practices which are also not to be questioned or debated
7341765 a statement about the preacher who is the son of the founder of the edge church at reynella in adelaide will be read at churches on sunday
7341766 what did you expect hes one of those high profile christians
7341767 i certainly hope that this issue isnt just swept under the rug and just a statement read it going to take a lot of humility trust building and restoration for this downfall to be turned around for the good
7341768 but for his home church this would be a disappointing and underwhelming response if planetshakers ignored peoples hurt and coldly kept to a prepared written statement
7341769 i dont know what our government does period i rock rocks clinton
7341770 we have been sort of like john mccain but not co us senators eating subsidized meals from irish linen and china while americans skip food
7341771 iraq get out iran stay out bush cheney drive out
7341772 it is with much pain and sadness that i make this statement today
7341773 for over 16 years i have struggled with an addition to adult pornography as a result of this secret life of sin my body would often breakdown
7341774 id report the cause of my symptoms simply as illnesses and ive thrown my life into a ministry for many years trying to compensate for my sin
7341775 i believe that i do love jesus and i know that he loves me and it is this love along with the prayers of people around the world that bring me to this place of confession
7341776 two years ago i reported that i was suffering from cancer the truth is that although i was ill i did not have cancer but was again using the misdiagnosis to hid the lie that i was living
7341777 i know in my heart that it is the truth alone that will set me free and this is the reason for my confession
7341778 ive dishonoured god my wife my family and the church and i take full responsibility for my actions and would like to make it very clear that no one else was in any way aware of my double life
7341779 im fully commited to a process of discipline recovery and restitution and will see this process through to what ever extent is necessary
7341780 i am deeply sorry and pray that you will find it in your hearts to forgive me
7341781 currently i am undergoing professional medical assessment and evaluation to help identify and begin to treat the real and much deeper issues
7341782 please continue to pray for my wife and i and my family as we have a long hard road ahead of us but a road that im thankful to god that im finally walking
7341783 is it because sexual sin is so much worse than any other sin or is it because we as christians get so hung up about sexual sin that we repress our own sexuality so deep that it bubbles to the surface in inappropriate and devastating ways
7341784 featuring henry seeley mike guglielmucci and sam evans this studio album is signature planetshakers praise and worship for a new generation includes cd and bonus dvd of planetshakers live worship and inspiring messages
7341785 featuring henry seeley and sam evans this studio album is signature planetshakers praise and worship for a new generation includes cd and bonus dvd of planetshakers live worship and inspiring messages
7341786 russell evans says 70 000 planetshakers albums are sold in australia each year with 12 albums released so far
7341787 i think its a little wierd that they would just
7341788 should planetshakers learn to focus all credit on jesus rather than individuals particularly given the flawed nature of humans which has never been more evident at planetshakers than in the michael guglielmucci cancer fraud
7341789 i think its a little wierd that they would just
7341790 the question is should anyones name be there better to keep the focus on jesus rather than the earthen vessels he uses
7341791 these churches do not understand grace the organization the brand and the revenue stream are always bigger and more important than the individual
7341792 some indeed preach christ even from envy and strife and some also from goodwill the former preach christ from selfish ambition not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my chains but the latter out of love knowing that i am appointed for the defense of the gospel what then only that in every way whether in pretense or in truth christ is preached and in this i rejoice yes and will rejoice
7341793 i say that with the utmost respect to the holy spirit
7341794 i am appalled disgusted angry is this how they solve issues shouldnt this be the time where planet shakers exercise what they preach since theyve been preaching about jesus forgiveness love grace etc theres no better time for them to even put them into practice
7341795 but among those who jumped on the lakeland bandwagon discernment was discouraged
7341796 god will never bless disunity if you are struggling with an issue against a brother or sister in the church then you need to deal with the issues and come to the place of unity
7341797 why didnt other ministers gifted people etc pick up on these lies
7341798 world wide is your strategy but shinning star i hope you see if the whole wide world is staring straight at you they cant see me
7341799 drink the kool aid or get out of line for the sake of unity
7341800 even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent and discerning if he holds his tongue

7341809 it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened who have tasted the heavenly gift who have shared in the holy spirit who have tasted the goodness of the word of god and the powers of the coming age if they fall away to be brought back to repentance because to their loss they are crucifying the son of god all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace
7341810 but if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea

7341878 committed to the implementation of an effective environmental management system that will not only reduce the impact of our activities on the environment but also increase our efficiency and effectiveness
7341879 but when he told me his choice i said thats the right choice
7341880 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president
7341881 i think we should have this for dinner tonight hows that sound
7341882 you know you should probably get that soup going soon
7341883 i want to remember him in his days of just undiluted glory
7341884 you listen to the ones who were concerned with what lyndon johnson did on the domestic side and you say there never was a surer touch
7341885 then you turn to vietnam reading the minutes of the meetings talking to people you have a sense of a man who didnt know what to do if i write this book correctly that contrast will emerge
7341886 i said to him if you really want to do this you have to go back and get your notes on the delegates and what went on out there and talk to me in detail
7341887 these were long hours of interviews you feel youre sitting there and you are a hearing a story that with everything everybody thinks they know about american politics nobody knows this story
7341888 he was very pale and thin and it was harder and harder for him to breathe
7341889 began to be realized when president lyndon johnson passed the civil rights act of 1964
7341890 i see barack obama as the apex of the lyndon johnson legacy
7341891 but you cant talk about iraq without talking about vietnam
7341892 you cant leave that out his presidency did not end in triumph
7341893 every generation pays very close attention to the major controversies of the time and when johnson left office in 1969 vietnam was still raging and a lot of americans were furious at johnson
7341894 they werent thinking about a lot of things they had liked about him like civil rights and in 1969 people were not as aware as historians are now of the efforts he made to get the country out of the war
7341895 the sense of that seems to be very much lost

7341909 colorado is one of the most important battleground states that will decide the presidency as sen john mccain and sen barack obama slug it out nose to nose if the national election is close in november a handful of votes in colorado will be decisive
7341910 right now independent voters are split with 46 percent for sen mccain and 44 percent for sen obama
7341911 who wins the election may wind up depending on whether voters look inward to the economy and fuel prices or outward to world hot spots
7341912 the reports weve received so far say guatemalans and americans were aboard the aircraft for a total of 14 including passengers and crew
7341913 by my count thats about 20 pages to read and about 30 calls to make but after four days and counting mr ofarrell still hasnt uttered a word
7341914 hes either making no effort at all or simply misleading the public either way hes taking the community for granted
7341915 the greens felt very strongly that this will be a highly significant test of the opposition environmental and economic credibility
7341916 his ability to resist lobbying from his friends in big business will be on trial

7341921 do we need the funding in idaho we could certainly use it
7341922 there is some concern about where idaho is going next
7341923 the resources are to be targeted to pick up foreclosed properties in effect it may be a bank that may own the property
7341924 my understanding is these dollars arent being targeted to rescue delinquent borrowers
7341925 theres no question these dollars will be put to use
7341926 that doesnt mean all those folks under financial duress will qualify

7341971 this means that the assets offered to lexshell were different and significantly more valuable than the offer made to the rest of the bidders
7341972 this renders the tender to sell the v amp a waterfront irregular and almost certainly unlawful
7341973 in addition despite the additional assets offered to lexshell they were not the highest bidders
7341974 after all the bids had been submitted lexshell increased theirs by r150m to r7bn to top the next highest offer

7341985 how many of the prophets fought in allahs way and with them fought large bands of godly men but they never lost heart if they met with disaster in allahs way nor did they weaken in will nor give in and allah loves those who are firm and steadfast
7341986 whenever allah wills good for a person he subjects him to adversity
7341987 and remember that abraham was tried by his lord with certain commands which he fulfilled he said
7341988 but my promise is not within the reach of evil doers
7341989 we know indeed the grief which their words do cause thee it is not thee they reject it is the signs of allah which the wicked condemn rejected were the apostles before thee with patience and constancy they bore their rejection and their wrongs until our aid did reach them there is none that can alter the words and decrees of allah already hast thou received some account of those apostles if their spurning is hard on thy mind yet if thou wert able to seek a tunnel in the ground or a ladder to the skies and bring them a sign what good if it were allahs will he could gather them together unto true guidance so be not thou amongst those who are swayed by ignorance and impatience
7341990 before thee we sent apostles to many nations and we afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity that they might learn humility
7341991 whenever we sent a prophet to a town we took up its people in suffering and adversity in order that they might learn humility
7341992 allah will not leave the believers in the state in which ye are now until he separates what is evil from what is good nor will he disclose to you the secrets of the unseen but he chooses of his messenger for the purpose whom he pleases so believe in allah and his apostles and if ye believe and do right ye have a reward without measure
7341993 or do ye think that ye shall enter the garden of bliss without such trials as came to those who passed away before you
7341994 or think ye that ye shall be abandoned as though allah did not know those among you who strive with might and main and take none for friends and protectors except allah his messenger and the community of believers but allah is well acquainted with all that ye do
7341995 do men think that they will be left alone on saying
7341996 hast thou not turned thy vision to those who were told to hold back their hands from fight but establish regular prayers and spend in regular charity
7341997 our lord why hast thou ordered us to fight wouldst thou not grant us respite to our natural term near enough
7341998 short is the enjoyment of this world the hereafter is the best for those who do right never will ye be dealt with unjustly in the very least
7341999 and their lord hath accepted of them and answered them
7342000 the believing man or woman continues to have affliction in person property and children so that they may finally meet allah free from sin
7342001 no calamity befalls a muslim but that allah expiates some of his sins because of it even though it were the prick he receives from a thorn
7342002 the prophets then those who come next to them then those who come next to them
7342003 verily the greatness of reward is proportionate to the greatness of the test and indeed if allah loves a people he tests them whoever is pleased upon him is allahs pleasure and whoever is angry upon him is allahs wrath
7342004 if allah wants to do good to somebody he afflicts him with trials

7342035 the lurking theme throughout this book and one which seems poised to take the forefront in the next two volumes is that of church vs state

7342040 by financially punishing noncompliant states with the loss of federal funding the regulation would intrude on the authority of states to enact and enforce laws that ensure womens access to birth control
7342041 this is a giant step down a road that will potentially leave women with a major loss of access to contraceptive methods
7342042 pregnancy is not a disease to be treated by abortion and neither is fertility
7342043 to be coerced to treat it as if it were a condition that is pathological is unjust
7342044 there is an organized effort to force health care professionals to do things that violate their conscience

7342047 early voting vote by mail and no excuse absentee balloting
7342048 its awesome im busy can always be busier but im lucky to be as busy as i am now i wrestle pretty much every weekend and thats all i can ask for
7342049 everybodys opinion is just something that motivated me to try and up my game in every aspect if people thought i was missing that one thing obviously there was something that wasnt connecting me to everybody which is the point in this business is to connect with everybody no matter who they are
7342050 right now things are going good theres a decent amount of young guys that are looking to work hard and earn their stripes and take the next step to become a better performer and a better pro wrestler so i think right now all the companies are doing sort of what they need to do to work together and help and keep everyone busy because thats the only way you can really learn in this business is to wrestle as much as you possibly can in front of different people and different crowds
7342051 there are a handful of groups that are doing right for this business in florida im pretty impressed with it actually
7342052 just having the opportunity to do the things ive done in ring of honor thats the first major test if i can stay there as long as i possibly can and make it there i can see no reason why i couldnt go anywhere else and stay for just as long
7342053 sometimes when that camera gets in your face i just lock up im not going to deny it its truthful and sometimes things dont come off the way i really feel about them its like anything anybody does like an actor tom cruise wasnt tom cruise right off the bat its all a matter of just finding your niche and finding out whats comfortable to you and what can put you into that character the easies thats the only way that you do get better
7342054 when you work with people you teach them the things you know and i try not to teach anything outside of my boundaries because obviously i dont know it if i dont have an understanding of it i wont try to teach somebody that it brings you back to your first day your second day so as you teach the people you kind of go through those steps again and you catch a lot of your flaws that you were making and didnt realize you were making because you havent been critiqued specifically as you are critiquing this person
7342055 it was a great opportunity when i was there and my face was on tv a lot in my four or five months that i was actually going on tv so i appreciated the opportunity there
7342056 me and austin aries got suspended we were asked to leave a ring of honor show early and miss it and fly into orlando for the pay per view we let them know that we would be making it to the pay per view but we had to fulfill our commitment to ring of honor as well we ended up making it to the pay per view just late and they suspended us because of that it was their decision and it was right in their book so im not going to argue with them about that
7342057 its just something in this business if you say you are going to be there you want to be there no matter what thats the way that people can believe in you and trust you in a business where trust is very important

7342065 jim ive already gotten authorization from our vp of development to put your project at the top of the stack as the mistake was ours he also insists that we take on this special project at our cost the good news is that when the standard interface is released in june well be delighted to provide it at no charge since you will have already paid for that capability
7342066 jim ive told you the news and explained the impact and a recommended course of action are there any issues that i may have missed do you have any questions or concerns
7342067 jim id like to know if i can count on you to accept my apology and continue to work with me to keep us moving forward together
7342068 the questions one asks will define the answers one gets

7342247 football is about winning it doesnt matter how well you play so long as you come off the pitch having picked up the points

7342267 you listen to the ones who were concerned with what lyndon johnson did on the domestic side and you say there never was a surer touch
7342268 then you turn to vietnam reading the minutes of the meetings talking to people you have a sense of a man who didnt know what to do if i write this book correctly that contrast will emerge
7342269 i said to him if you really want to do this you have to go back and get your notes on the delegates and what went on out there and talk to me in detail
7342270 these were long hours of interviews you feel youre sitting there and you are a hearing a story that with everything everybody thinks they know about american politics nobody knows this story
7342271 he was very pale and thin and it was harder and harder for him to breathe
7342272 began to be realized when president lyndon johnson passed the civil rights act of 1964
7342273 i see barack obama as the apex of the lyndon johnson legacy
7342274 but you cant talk about iraq without talking about vietnam
7342275 you cant leave that out his presidency did not end in triumph
7342276 every generation pays very close attention to the major controversies of the time and when johnson left office in 1969 vietnam was still raging and a lot of americans were furious at johnson
7342277 they werent thinking about a lot of things they had liked about him like civil rights and in 1969 people were not as aware as historians are now of the efforts he made to get the country out of the war
7342278 the sense of that seems to be very much lost

7342305 i dont know of any round these parts at the minute and anyway theyre not the kind of places nice girls like you would want to visit at the best of times
7342306 oh its what theyre calling the campsite where a lot of the non academics are staying you know the druids wiccans and that lot
7342307 they say the craic is brilliant music in the dunes dancing on the sands
7342308 you should talk youre just a pup your own self
7342309 low light and strong drink can take years off a woman in a mans eyes
7342310 a spring chicken is not always such a fine thing to be
7342311 sometimes its all you can do to survive until the summer spring chickens tend to end up in the pot unless youre careful i intend to be a tough old bird for a very long time
7342312 the campgrounds up the road there you cant see it properly because theres a hedge in the way but it sounds like the partys moved from the camp down onto the beach quite sensible really if you think about it some of the old pagans need their sleep after all
7342313 well youre a man anyway im not so sure about the awful part
7342314 we can go back later and ill show you the rest of it my private quarters
7342315 yes many many items of interest to be seen and handling of said items of interest is encouraged
7342316 are you saying youre nothing but an old museum specimen now
7342317 a throwback to a simpler time a real caveman me
7342318 im not sure theres enough here to be dragging me along the ground by not that id let you mind atavistic mating habits will only get you so far with the modern girl im afraid
7342319 i better go rescue maeve from that witch so she can give in to her baser instincts as she so obviously wants to do
7342320 she doesnt look that bad a little bit staid maybe
7342321 no she really is a witch one of that san francisco lot that organize the conference quite nice but as you say a bit boring
7342322 you must help me get in contact with someone soon during the conference i mean
7342323 a fellow from san francisco jeffrey arnott ever heard of him
7342324 this is a wind up it must be you might as well go to rome and ask someone at the vatican if theyd heard of the pope
7342325 oh yes he is that that big i mean he is that well known quite a respected scholar of the east lothian witches and their trials in addition to being a practicing wiccan himself high priest of the coven that organizes this her high priest as a matter of fact
7342326 i wouldnt be surprised if he was here tonight seeing his wifes here
7342327 she was in the pub a couple of weeks ago on the very morning it was shut down where is she by the way i cant spot her myself
7342328 i asked if you wanted to see me dancing naked around the fire
7342329 sally my dear theres nothing id like better and i hope to god you hold that thought
7342330 i know this sounds mad but i really need to see this arnott character before we join the wild chase tonight
7342331 im all right im all right really im okay just the drink and all this ill be fine in a second
7342332 mmm did you see that linda parker her from america that was bending my ear over there
7342333 jesus and mary here she comes again scuse me folks
7342334 and youre the bartender at the silver darlings arent you
7342335 did you ever see the like it gets worse every year more and more of the non academics its a regular woodstock next theyll set up giant stages and amplifiers
7342336 course you and maeve are newbies here arent you its a good year to come a good programme jeffs going to give the keynote tomorrow some big plans for developing the conference in the future pity about her though
7342337 i dont know what he sees in her i really dont
7342338 i think she went off with some man didnt see him myself
7342339 linda did you say that jeffrey arnott fellow is here tonight
7342340 can you look after sally for a minute i need to talk to mr arnott
7342341 anyway your call i guess thats him over there sitting on the blanket young latino beside him theyre signing to each other
7342342 anyway thanks linda i think ive spotted them now sally are you all right for a minute i really have to talk to mr arnott about some urgent business
7342343 mr arnott asks that you call him jeff and that hes pleased to meet you you must be the landlord of he silver darlings
7342344 so how does this work then do i talk to you or to him
7342345 okay that suits me well really two things i wanted to thank you for paying for the window at my pub and to ask you why you did it i mean we arent exactly bosom buddies if you see what i mean
7342346 now hold on just a minute would you ive only asked why youve helped me with me pub window id not have it be a cause for the two of you to fall out lets just say it was from the goodness of your hear and leave it at that
7342347 listen adolpho is it i may have said something to offend you and if i have will you accept my sincere apologies and my hand of friendship
7342348 youve only been the soul of courtesy and respect you havent offended me in any way
7342349 the reason mr arnott paid for your pub window is because he would like to acquire the silver darlings from you he is prepared to make you a handsome offer way above the market value
7342350 youll not be fooling me as easily as all that
7342351 why id rather sell me old grannys bones to a witch doctor no offence mr arnott im sure well it was nice meeting you boys to be sure but ive got a warm willing woman waiting for me at least i hope shes still waiting
7342352 you dont have to worry mr leary mr arnott would keep you on to manage the bar at a very fair salary so nobodys suggesting that you give up he place altogether
7342353 im afraid you dont have many options here mr leary
7342354 you see the local authorities here were tipped off about things like insurance and licences mr arnott has the ear of influential men here in east lothian and edinburgh and i think youre going to find it very difficult if not impossible to reopen the darlings on your own
7342355 mr arnott says that he will buy the silver darlings whatever happens either from you or at public auction it just depends on whether you want to get anything out of it or not and of course if you decline to sell im afraid mr arnotts offer of employment will be withdrawn
7342356 where is it what has you done with my thing
7342357 maybe you shouldnt be opening that i think it might belong to that woman over there that mrs arnott
7342358 hillary clintons support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt
7342359 its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7342360 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton she had 50 of the democratic vote obama has 50 of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party and it seems to me that for whatever reason that hasnt been explained a choice was made out of weakness than strength you know dont go with a strongest candidate and then go with a candidate that actually emphasizes all of your weaknesses and has been quite vocal about them

7342412 dobrowolski has covered the city of pittsfield for the eagle since may 2005 he joined the newspaper as a sportswriter in 1992 and also has served as a night reporter courts and police reporter pittsfield schools reporter and the dalton town reporter
7342413 for years the newspaper industry has taught us that the closer you are to the front page the more important the news it is disturbing to me a subscriber for more than 18 years and a small business owner that business is not as important as it once was to the n amp o
7342414 is there any possibility that the n amp o can switch the order of local news and business news or at least swap days business first on tuesday thursday saturday or share the front page of the section
7342415 i fear that business not getting the emphasis it once did doesnt bode well for the future of business at large in the triangle

7342424 in short our coverage was much more useful and interesting than i expected it to be instead of a cursory look at sports and money it turned into an in depth lesson about the business tentacles running through worlds biggest sporting event
7342425 after these things i john looked and behold a great multitude which no one could count from every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues standing before the throne and before the lamb clothed in white robes and palm branches were in their hands and they cry out with a loud voice saying salvation to our god who sits on the throne and to the lamb
7342426 these are they who have come out of great tribulation and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb for this reason they are before the throne of god and they serve him day and night in his temple and he who sits on the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them they shall hunger no more neither thirst anymore neither shall the sun beat down on them nor any heat for the lamb in the center of the throne shall be their shepherd and shall guide them to springs of the water of life and god shall wipe every tear from their eyes

7342437 it was an amazing moment for everybody in that room
7342438 a transforming moment where you could see in the eyes of afghanis who had thought they had lost their heritage of western scholars including myself who thought that we would never ever see these treasures there they were
7342439 its remarkable that a secret is something known by one person
7342440 and once its known by more than one its no longer a secret
7342441 well it was known by this small group of people and i know that many many people asked them about the whereabouts of these collections and its something about the noble character of afghans that they kept their secret
7342442 they were found by a series of farmers in northern afghanistan who had no idea that these were 4 000 year old treasures
7342443 and they were so happy with their good luck of having found these golden bowls that they immediately started to divide up their good luck
7342444 its completely iconic of the kind of art that the greeks would bring to the afghan area to impose and to show their culture and it became part of the fabric of the art of afghanistan
7342445 absolutely there is in fact no road its a series of caravans serais those are trading places which are connected by traders and they go east and west connecting rome with china but also north and south connecting siberia and russia
7342446 theres a real sense of a kind of universal design that goes back to pre history practically
7342447 and i think its important to understand that afghanistan was a critical link in trade in cultures east and west as much two thousand years ago as it is today
7342448 the future of afghanistan looks pretty bleak theres no indication that this country like its history is going to be much different
7342449 well morley ill have to admit that im perhaps an impossible optimist
7342450 but actually i see a lot of hope in afghanistan
7342451 its simply a fact much of its wealth is based on illicit trade of drugs and warlords still seem to rule the day
7342452 thats why i actually think that an exhibition about the ancient culture of afghanistan about the heritage about giving afghans their sense of pride is so important not only for us here in the united states but for people back in afghanistan
7342453 a nation stays alive when its culture and history stay alive

7342457 in some cases more that one computer can access the internet over a single ip address by using network translation
7342458 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
7342459 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

7342463 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed

7342465 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement

7342472 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
7342473 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
7342474 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

7342699 mayormente se ver an micro naves espaciales en comunicaciones en lugar de haber compa as que compart an un gran sat lite podr a haber incluso peque as compa as que tienen su propia micro nave espacial
7342700 para el ej rcito el hecho de que sea indetectable es tambi n importante para aplicaciones de vigilancia o cuando se trata de atacar a otros sat lites
7342701 y cuando se trata de una nave espacial de menos de 5 kilogramos 10 libras realmente no se puede detectar a menos que est dentro de un cuarto de milla las naves espaciales m s grandes pueden ser detectadas desde m s lejos y por consiguiente sacarlas del cielo con un disparo
7342702 podr a sonar muy trivial pero controlar la temperatura de una nave espacial es absolutamente crucial en este momento no hay manera de hacerlo para las naves espaciales muy peque as
7342703 el control t rmico era realmente la gran barrera al desarrollar las naves espaciales en miniatura
7342704 esto deber a permitir un desarrollo mucho m s r pido de las micro y nano naves espaciales
7342705 la prueba para micrometeoritos fue muy simple disparamos un arma cargada con peque as part culas y diminutas agujas como arpones

7342738 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar

7342740 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved

7342787 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7342788 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7342789 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7342790 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it

7342798 you listen to the ones who were concerned with what lyndon johnson did on the domestic side and you say there never was a surer touch
7342799 then you turn to vietnam reading the minutes of the meetings talking to people you have a sense of a man who didnt know what to do if i write this book correctly that contrast will emerge
7342800 i said to him if you really want to do this you have to go back and get your notes on the delegates and what went on out there and talk to me in detail
7342801 these were long hours of interviews you feel youre sitting there and you are a hearing a story that with everything everybody thinks they know about american politics nobody knows this story
7342802 he was very pale and thin and it was harder and harder for him to breathe
7342803 began to be realized when president lyndon johnson passed the civil rights act of 1964
7342804 i see barack obama as the apex of the lyndon johnson legacy
7342805 but you cant talk about iraq without talking about vietnam
7342806 you cant leave that out his presidency did not end in triumph
7342807 every generation pays very close attention to the major controversies of the time and when johnson left office in 1969 vietnam was still raging and a lot of americans were furious at johnson
7342808 they werent thinking about a lot of things they had liked about him like civil rights and in 1969 people were not as aware as historians are now of the efforts he made to get the country out of the war

7342810 i will have to answer that for myself before i can answer it for you
7342811 nosso time melhorou mas precisamos ficar atentos na defesa tivemos uma bobeira e sofremos o gol
7342812 n s sab amos que precis vamos reagir depois da derrota para o internacional precis vamos mostrar nossas condi es e um bom jogo era fundamental para isso ganhamos for a e estamos mais pr ximos da parte de cima da tabela
7342813 minha viv ncia no futebol me diz que as pessoas que me criticam em uma derrota s o as mesmas que v o me elogiar quando meu time vence n o podemos avaliar nosso trabalho por um ou outro resultado
7342814 n o temos nem o que falar sobre o primeiro tempo deu tudo errado at come amos bem mas de repente o palmeiras come ou a fazer os gols e n s n o conseguimos reagir complicado jogar assim
7342815 n s n o come amos mal mas nos perdemos depois que o palmeiras colocou tr s zagueiros fomos amplamente dominados no primeiro tempo e sabemos que isso complicado para uma equipe que precisa reagir no brasileiro correr atr s sempre mais dif cil
7342816 by my count thats about 20 pages to read and about 30 calls to make but after four days and counting mr ofarrell still hasnt uttered a word

7342830 coming in as the new kid being a middle linebacker and being a d1 player people look at you as a leader
7342831 at the same time there are a lot of kids who were already here and this is their senior year so i understand how they feel about somebody new coming in
7342832 this summer i wasnt a real vocal leader i just went out there and worked hard and tried to show them what i could do when we played the jamboree this weekend i was more active and a lot more vocal
7342833 i feel like we are going to have a real good team
7342834 we are kind of a junior led team we have a good senior leadership but we have a real talented junior class a lot of those guys played last year so they arent your typical juniors starting for the first time

7342842 the whole project was just stopped end of discussion he said
7342843 it appears that it was michael powell not the public who preferred to make decisions based on personal ideology
7342844 but you can go too far and i dont plan to do that
7342845 if this draft legislation were passed in its present form the director of the central intelligence agency has told me that he did not believe that the interrogation program could go forward
7342846 together with elvis and johnny cash wills is in both the country music and rock n roll halls of fame
7342847 there was a connection between the events of september 11 2001 and iraq

7342849 if it was anyone else wed be stringing them up by their neck but no its bobby dee and the folk process
7342850 who cares what you think punk you dont even have a name
7342851 this is an issue of having community leaders come to an agreement
7342852 was inspired by partisan divisions inside the broadcasting board of governors
7342853 to resist economic pressures to make additional cuts which could remove it from the top ranks of american journalism
7342854 but as a community voice in the metropolitan region the los angeles times is irreplaceable
7342855 so good to see you ive heard about your good news congratulations
7342856 that little nerd is going to be controlling hundreds of thousands of dollars in awards

7342861 if youre giving out two prizes theyre going to bellow and roth three then its bellow and roth and ozick
7342862 between them theyve put out something like a hundred books and in all those years of chatter all those forests laid to waste neither of them has been able to come up with one lifelike woman character
7342863 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
7342864 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive
7342865 maybe i can get you on charlies show you and one of the patriarchs
7342866 in an even more dire situation than the active army but both have the same symptoms i just have a higher fever
7342867 i have tried to be careful never to say the risen book was irrelevant ive said it was a factor in reopening the discussion
7342868 for information about the rally or what else you can do to fight the genocide see with african union peacekeepers scheduled to leave darfur at the end of this month and the sudanese government mounting a military campaign against helpless and starving darfurians the horrific situation there may very well turn even worse for hundreds of thousands of people
7342869 i couldnt imagine somebody like osama bin laden understanding the joy of channukah

7342876 the great red zone that voted for bush is clearly ready for war the decadent left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead and may well mount a fifth column
7342877 sinceramente prefiero y espero que el senador de castro font recapacite y entienda que de lo que esto se trata es de que podemos hacer un contraste dram tico con el ppd
7342878 cuando t tienes un juez federal que emite tres rdenes de allanamiento eso no es un cotejo eso es mucho m s serio que meramente un cotejo de informaci n esto no fue una visita de cortes a a pedir informaci n
7342879 it was an amazing moment for everybody in that room
7342880 a transforming moment where you could see in the eyes of afghanis who had thought they had lost their heritage of western scholars including myself who thought that we would never ever see these treasures there they were
7342881 its remarkable that a secret is something known by one person
7342882 and once its known by more than one its no longer a secret
7342883 well it was known by this small group of people and i know that many many people asked them about the whereabouts of these collections and its something about the noble character of afghans that they kept their secret
7342884 they were found by a series of farmers in northern afghanistan who had no idea that these were 4 000 year old treasures
7342885 and they were so happy with their good luck of having found these golden bowls that they immediately started to divide up their good luck
7342886 its completely iconic of the kind of art that the greeks would bring to the afghan area to impose and to show their culture and it became part of the fabric of the art of afghanistan
7342887 absolutely there is in fact no road its a series of caravans serais those are trading places which are connected by traders and they go east and west connecting rome with china but also north and south connecting siberia and russia
7342888 theres a real sense of a kind of universal design that goes back to pre history practically
7342889 and i think its important to understand that afghanistan was a critical link in trade in cultures east and west as much two thousand years ago as it is today
7342890 the future of afghanistan looks pretty bleak theres no indication that this country like its history is going to be much different
7342891 well morley ill have to admit that im perhaps an impossible optimist
7342892 but actually i see a lot of hope in afghanistan
7342893 its simply a fact much of its wealth is based on illicit trade of drugs and warlords still seem to rule the day
7342894 thats why i actually think that an exhibition about the ancient culture of afghanistan about the heritage about giving afghans their sense of pride is so important not only for us here in the united states but for people back in afghanistan
7342895 a nation stays alive when its culture and history stay alive
7342896 were expecting the worst of the tropical storm this afternoon
7342897 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking
7342898 i want to remember him in his days of just undiluted glory
7342899 you listen to the ones who were concerned with what lyndon johnson did on the domestic side and you say there never was a surer touch
7342900 then you turn to vietnam reading the minutes of the meetings talking to people you have a sense of a man who didnt know what to do if i write this book correctly that contrast will emerge
7342901 i said to him if you really want to do this you have to go back and get your notes on the delegates and what went on out there and talk to me in detail
7342902 these were long hours of interviews you feel youre sitting there and you are a hearing a story that with everything everybody thinks they know about american politics nobody knows this story
7342903 he was very pale and thin and it was harder and harder for him to breathe
7342904 began to be realized when president lyndon johnson passed the civil rights act of 1964
7342905 i see barack obama as the apex of the lyndon johnson legacy
7342906 but you cant talk about iraq without talking about vietnam
7342907 you cant leave that out his presidency did not end in triumph
7342908 every generation pays very close attention to the major controversies of the time and when johnson left office in 1969 vietnam was still raging and a lot of americans were furious at johnson
7342909 they werent thinking about a lot of things they had liked about him like civil rights and in 1969 people were not as aware as historians are now of the efforts he made to get the country out of the war
7342910 the sense of that seems to be very much lost
7342911 behold i have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth and every tree with seed in its fruit you shall have them for food and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth everything that has the breath of life i have given every green plant for food
7342912 grease soup with balls of fried grease and grease marinated pork
7342913 i have arrived to south ossetia to see that has occurred and as the rights of people were broken he has told to journalists in tskhinvali that here has occurred two weeks ago should not repeat this insult of mankind the insult of the human rights
7342914 after that i will prepare the report which will be published that all europe has understood that has occurred and that it is necessary to make to heal wounds of war and to correct the position which has developed as a result of war
7342915 after that i will prepare the report which will be published that all europe has understood that has occurred and that it is necessary to make to heal a wound of war and to correct the position which has developed as a result of war
7342916 glory be to god in the highest peace be unto the whole world good wishes to all mankind god almighty thank you
7342917 on the other side of fear is the great stuff
7342918 identify and break through your fear to go to the next level
7342919 the greatest moments of worship are always on the other side of fear
7342920 the reason the chinese might have to tell a fib about the age of their athletes simple young girls make perfect gymnasts with their bodies and minds uncluttered with the fear of falling and failure
7342921 blueprint to operate over the next 10 to 15 years
7342922 the chinese government and public have become more self confident
7342923 for this olympics they made few concessions on human rights and other things and in their hearts i think china will pay less heed to western criticism in the future
7342924 after the olympics the world sees good prospects for china
7342925 track and field competition is no longer ruled by the americans
7342926 before the olympics the most important goal was to do our best to make this the best olympics in history
7342927 but after march when tibetans rioted in lhasa the government decided this was not realistic and they changed the slogan to launch a successful olympics with chinese characteristics
7342928 i think they would have helped themselves much more if they had allowed some protest
7342929 i think that was silly they got some bad press and the ioc criticized them for it
7342930 im the kind of guy who would run out of a building not run into a building during a fire
7342931 if i want the family to get sick i do
7342932 its a love story its a love triangle but not one of those nasty ones
7342933 the great thing about two people doing the show that dont live together is that they have two points of view
7342934 i look good on that show because she makes me look good
7342935 elect us or the terrorist will kill you and the dummycrats will raise your taxes
7342936 was born in caracas venezuela and grew up in the suburbs of richmond virginia at the age of 18 i escaped to new york city i danced clowned performed and scared my parents a lot i traveled and continue to do so around the the world at the age of 24 i became delusional and thought moving to los angeles was a good idea now i design and produce video games
7342937 an intensely talented guitarist which teamed with his dexterous voice and heart marksman songwriting skills make him a star waiting to shine you havent seen someone this good and this under the radar
7342938 break into the game industry how to get a job making video games
7342939 this incident indicates that iraqi women understand their importance in society and value life
7342940 the surrender of the suicide bomber indicates that the iraqis are continuing to reject al qaeda and its practices the police will ensure the rule of law prevails and those responsible are brought to justice
7342941 he told me that tooth no 17 was pushing tooth no 18 and that there was not enough space for both to co exist
7342942 they should be called stupid teeth my dentist says they are useless so why do wisdom teeth exist in the first place
7342943 yes the teeth might disappear many people already dont have them
7342944 i think peoples food habits are largely responsible for this phenomenon earlier our food was more fibrous which was good for the jaw with taste becoming a priority wisdom teeth have taken a beating
7342945 as of now wisdom teeth have been reduced to small stumps with the reduction in jaw size
7342946 short haul traffic out of hyderabad and bangalore has already suffered we are not in favour of levying a udf as this would further dent traffic if developers want this fee theyll have to collect it themselves for the time being
7342947 if people have to stand in queues to pay this levy then the experience of using the first two world class airports in india can lose some of its charm after all these airports were supposed to end the pain of lining up endlessly
7342948 hyderabad and bangalore airports are quite far from city centres a further levy of udf will act as yet another deterrent to flying from these places
7342949 apabila kebetulan saiful tersalah sebut lafaz sumpahnya oleh kerana saya berada di situ jadi saya tegurlah
7342950 shes a cool girl and shes better than she was because at one point she was in a bad way
7342951 i wish her all the best with whatever she does and if shes with a girl then good for her in this day and age its all good
7342952 it stopped being the fresh faced guys who get medals on their chests at the end of star wars it became people who were willing to sacrifice everything for the greater good
7342953 one of the most heroic movies i ever saw was rocky a guy who lasts 15 rounds before he loses a fight
7342954 what little kid five or six years old hasnt gone around the house with his eyes closed and hands out
7342955 cmon superman is ridiculous he has blue hair he can fly it cant just be this guys having a bad day if daredevil has a nervous breakdown people are going to get hit
7342956 when you have a brush in your hand inking a beautiful woman is a lot like running your hands over her
7342957 in sin city they may be hookers but theyre not just being fucked and left for dead theyre the law of the town keeping shit together
7342958 frank talks about his characters as if they wont let him go until theyve told him their stories
7342959 the only characters that survive are the ones who are tough enough to fight back maybe thats why he ends up with the hardest and scariest
7342960 when i first got going on what became the dark knight i just thought about him a lot what kind of guy would do this stuff
7342961 i like to refer to a hard boiled hero as a knight in blood caked armor
7342962 one of my favorite lines is when marv is about to kill the priest
7342963 the priest played by miller says youd better ask yourself if this whore is worth dying for marv says worth killing for worth dying for worth going to hell for while hes shooting him
7342964 its the motive for a politician a hero does the right thing because its the right thing
7342965 i did this comic in the 1990s so i never could have expected that it would get this reaction from hawks
7342966 i did 300 years before 9 11 but you dont have to read much between the lines to see that i believe there is good and there is evil as the great cartoonist wallace wood said its the job of the good guys to kill the bad guys
7342967 people probably didnt think i would get far because of where im from
7342968 being able to do what ive always wanted to do my entire life is a gift and my whole dream has come true to see where i am from where i was is just crazy
7342969 almost every scene we did selena would say oh my gosh were shooting a movie right now and then it just hit us we met each other the day we started working on our careers so its pretty ironic how things turn out
7342970 everyone on the disney channel is really uplifting people try to pit me against miley but she sent me a four page text saying how she knows its overwhelming right now and she wants to help
7342971 we were concentrating more on the flight than the record
7342972 ill give your willy a welt like you aint never felt
7342973 by my count thats about 20 pages to read and about 30 calls to make but after four days and counting mr ofarrell still hasnt uttered a word
7342974 hes either making no effort at all or simply misleading the public either way hes taking the community for granted
7342975 the greens felt very strongly that this will be a highly significant test of the opposition environmental and economic credibility
7342976 his ability to resist lobbying from his friends in big business will be on trial

7343043 does it make sense for a good being to create creatures who will experience infinite torture infinite time infinite you know never be numbed in their consciousness i mean how would you even create a universe where that sort of thing could happen it just sounds it really raises some questions about the goodness of god
7343044 the traditional understanding says that god asks of us something that god is incapable of himself god asks us to forgive people but god is incapable of forgiving god cant forgive unless he punishes somebody in place of the person he was going to forgive god doesnt say things to you forgive your wife and then go kick the dog to vent your anger god asks you to actually forgive and theres a certain sense that a common understanding of the atonement presents a god who is incapable of forgiving unless he kicks somebody else

7343094 it is possible to get coverage of lesser known actors and movies
7343095 i got a handwritten envelope and invitation to a play and because the publicist had such a passion for the client i decided to cover the play and that relationship grew later the play became a move and oscar contender my big fat greek wedding was an academy award nominated 2002 romantic comedy film
7343096 if your story has a connection to hollywood it is a fun and interesting story it will be easy to sell tease and promote
7343097 we do a little more edgy story for the insider and we have stories with a different hook
7343098 my news director at a radio station had a big picture of a crowded freeway posted on the outside of his office door that read how many of these people are watching tv or reading the newspaper
7343099 because of who i work for i have no local interest
7343100 the associated press is worldwide my pieces are heard with my voice wrapped around the interviews ive done or i will use individual sound bites all of that goes to toronto syracuse vancouver an4sd 50 every where so a little local interest doesnt work what my audience wants is a recognizable name recognizable celebrities or a tie into a recognizable movie tv show stage plays or something like that were they dont have to scratch their heads in the 30 seconds in the time telling the story
7343101 i only have 40 seconds and i work with recognizable names in movies or a list celebrities
7343102 less is more and the phones work well with us we dont have to get all our interviews in person
7343103 i actually prefer doing a phone interview and remember 90 seconds moves like a freight train but since it is syndicated your story is moving nationally ross loves exclusives and prefers email pitches at
7343104 the one that his handed to you and the one you get from digging for three months exclusives include websites getting the story first by a 15 minutes or a day it is very very important to have good relationships with reporters
7343105 you need to have a fun story because boring doesnt work for us the question producers ask is how do i tease that if they dont know how to promote the story then they producers will have less interest in it if i get a good tease and pitch for a story then often i will get the green light
7343106 if the publicist could be just one step ahead then i can tell them i only get a minute and half for this story and maybe i can interview them later just to be put on the spot is a little tough especially if you do not know who that person is and that happens on a regular basis
7343107 rod roddy says come on down and get your colonoscopy
7343108 it got my attention and we probably would have aired the story if we had the tv show the price is right on our station
7343109 i can take nuggets i dont need a whole lot of video or audio because my national syndicated program is only 90 seconds however sometime i will take a local story and offer it to the news desk at kfwb
7343110 there are two audiences we are serving the audience in the car and the audience of the stations we are serving
7343111 however there are some stories that the audience wants to know but the station program directors are not too thrilled with it
7343112 ap gets a lot of exclusives due to the enormity of its distribution
7343113 we like to get exclusives it is part of the challenge and fun of the business
7343114 most of my stories are a day of local charity and it makes no sense to exclude a station at a charitable event and if we are told we are not allowed to cover a charity because it is an exclusive event for another station we will report that we are not allowed entering the event if exclusive for et at least let us have the story for the 11 p m news i dont want to get a story that aired two days ago on channel 5 ktla

7343129 this will happen even though there exist many obstacles to it among them enormous but corroding institutions as these lines are being written something is happening in the united states that has had no precedent a great division among the american people has begun gradually slowly to take shape not between republicans and democrats and not between conservatives and liberals but between people who are still unthinking believers in technology and in economic determinism and people who are not the non believers may or may not be be conscious or convinced traditionalists but they are men and women who have begun not only to question but here and there to oppose publicly the increasing pouring of cement over the land the increasing inflation of automobile traffic of every kind the increasing acceptance of noisome machinery ruling their lives compared with this division the present debates about taxes and rates and political campaigns are nothing but ephemeral froth blowing here and there on little waves atop the great oceanic tides of history

7343201 the down side is that its pretty easy to become complacent and think im recycling im cool
7343202 i got to see him use music to effect social change and do environmental work protecting the hudson river
7343203 i sometimes say we were sort of like mickey rooney and judy garland in those old movies where its sort of like hey lets do a show and save the school
7343204 were like lets do a show and help the planet
7343205 when i feel like the most normal person in the room theres a problem
7343206 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7343207 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7343208 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7343209 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7343210 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7343211 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7343212 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7343213 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7343214 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7343215 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7343216 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
7343217 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot
7343218 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7343219 he was able to make the medicare vote and that was the vote that turned the bill around
7343220 the convention would be a nice thing for him to show up at
7343221 its certainly one hed like to do if he could but the medicare vote was a must do this is not a have to
7343222 there is so much more in common with hillary clinton and barack obama than with john mccain
7343223 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7343224 women have the most to gain with the election of barack obama and the most to lose with the election of john mccain
7343225 i think to some degree ive become a shorthand or a symbol or a stand in for now
7343226 its a spirit that says we are looking for different
7343227 this is not something colorado needs its not worker driven
7343228 it creates a business and living environment that appreciates different points of view and has a degree of tolerance that makes for a good business climate
7343229 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7343230 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7343231 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
7343232 i firmly believe that any mans finest hour the greatest fulfillment of all that he holds dear is that moment when he has worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle victorious
7343233 the underlying facts in this case are just too serious why should this defendant who made this type of claim be able to just walk away
7343234 she didnt make it back to the party and received a phone call wondering where she was
7343235 when she finally arrived at the party with no money and no crack she said she was scared and told the people she was stopped by police
7343236 shes going to choose the pressure of the law over the pressure of her family the next time
7343237 the claim was made and to some degree remnants of that claim remain out there whether its in the southington police department or the community
7343238 these are accusations that stayed within the southington community for months each and every one of those patrol officers and detectives in southington were affected
7343239 under the american patriarchy where men matter and women dont
7343240 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7343241 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7343242 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7343243 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7343244 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7343245 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7343246 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7343247 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7343248 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7343249 he just started swimming freestyle and backstroke and only stopped to slide belly first onto the tanks platform so he could be fed dozens of fried egg sandwiches
7343250 he fell asleep at the surface of the water around midnight
7343251 those seated in the first 14 rows should be prepared to get soaked
7343252 also michaels two friends olympic swimmers ryan lochte and jason lezak will open the show with their humorous beach ball antics
7343253 i have never seen a stranger yet more majestic looking creature
7343254 last year we went to seaworld san diego and saw michaels female counterpart michelle and even though the show was a little funnier than this one nothing compares to watching michael almost hover over the water after launching his trainer into the air
7343255 i liked it when he played dead and floated in the water
7343256 when he was placed back into his tank the slightly loose portion of his black swim cap immediately folded over to the right side a telltale symptom of stress and angst and you can be certain that just before he left for beijing he didnt bite that little girls arm off because he was happy
7343257 it is quite obvious the americans bombed the area due to wrong information
7343258 i am 100 percent confident that someone gave the information due to a tribal dispute
7343259 a comprehensive tool that americans are using to touch the world
7343260 published literature on the information behaviour and preferences of young people over the past thirty years
7343261 this is the first time that anyone has actually profiled on any real scale the information seeking behaviour of the virtual scholar by age
7343262 can be characterised as being horizontal bouncing checking and viewing in nature users are promiscuous diverse and volatile
7343263 that from undergraduates to professors people exhibit a strong tendency towards shallow horizontal flicking behaviour in digital libraries power browsing and viewing appear to be the norm for all the popularity of abstracts among older researchers rather gives the game away society is dumbing down
7343264 es ist sch n wenn ich der gesellschaft auch einmal etwas zur ck geben kann
7343265 i dont think the victim is in any condition for police to speak to him
7343266 theyre at a bit of a loose end as to why it happened
7343267 if he does get any better we will have to talk with him then
7343268 in a western and elitist way we have viewed chinas right to its olympic games to its coming out its moment of glory with condescension and concessional tolerance
7343269 the western critic feeling the epicentre of the world changing but not at all liking it seeks to put down these vast societies on the basis that their political and value systems dont match up to theirs
7343270 perhaps the most egregious example of international double dealing of any international regime
7343271 the plain fact is there can be no non proliferation without de proliferation
7343272 if the weapon states are not prepared to rid themselves of nuclear weapons why would other states continue to deny themselves the kind of leverage that these weapons bring

7343277 among other things the defense system recommends that israel demand that unifil operate also inside the villages in south lebanon that have turned into a fertile area for hezbollah activity and within which unifil declines to enter the system also recommends changing unifils instruction for opening fire in order to enable them to act with greater determination against violations of hezbolllah south of the litani
7343278 once unifils mandate has been extended the defense ministry recommends that israel campaign to expand the troops power to engage hostile forces on the ground

7343288 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
7343289 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
7343290 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero
7343291 lidea pi assurda e ridicola come se io potessi mai trovare il modo di esistere senza aver bisogno di te

7343332 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7343333 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7343334 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect

7343337 offered up to 1 000 for scoring well on advanced placement exams students at 31 new york city high schools took 345 more of the tests this year than last but the number who passed declined slightly raising questions about the effectiveness of increasingly popular pay for performance programs in schools here and across the country students involved in the program financed with 2 million in private donations and aimed at closing a racial gap in advanced placement results posted more 5s the highest possible score that rise however was overshadowed by a decline in the number of 4s and 3s three is the minimum passing score
7343338 im just dumbfounded that they can regard this as an achievement or as a great improvement or as something worth spending the money on
7343339 im surprised that that kind of money that kind of incentives doesnt produce better results it sort of undercuts the argument that the problem is the question of motivation

7343530 conquered states can be held by the conqueror in three different ways the first is to ruin them the second for the conqueror to go and reside there in person and the third is to allow them to continue to live under their own laws subject to a regular tribute and to create in them a government of the few who will keep the country friendly to the conqueror

7343547 it was discovered that hidden 12 to 15 feet beneath the river bottom many of these piles were connected by a nearly continuous massive heavy timber mat fastened together using steel rods and spikes
7343548 that removal of the mat like structure had disturbed the top 12 to 15 feet of the soils to such an extent that the bulkhead would not be stable as designed
7343549 in order to stabilize the bulkhead the design engineer determined it will be necessary to install an anchor system consisting of anchor piles and anchor rods along the entire length of the bulkhead nearly 200 of these anchor structures will be required in addition the amount of rip rap at the base of the bulkhead on the river side beneath the riverwalk will be nearly doubled the cost of the additional work is 1 224 540

7343607 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7343608 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7343609 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7343610 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7343611 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7343612 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7343613 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7343614 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7343615 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7343616 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7343617 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7343618 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7343619 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7343620 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7343621 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7343622 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7343623 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7343624 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7343625 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7343626 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7343627 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7343628 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7343629 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7343630 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7343631 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7343632 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7343633 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7343634 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7343635 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7343636 is that i wish a woman would have been on the ticket but alas america is not ready to embrace and support having a woman on the ticket top or otherwise
7343637 this is a guy who can out straight talk the straight talk express
7343638 you might not always like what joe says but hes going to give it to you straight
7343639 but in terms of their approach to things they are very similar i was a big supporter of chet in regard to that process we all knew it was a long shot
7343640 i still believe that hillary clinton would have been a better choice for obama
7343641 selecting senator clinton would have unified my party in ways that no other pick could reigniting the enthusiasm of 18 million hillary supporters
7343642 id be happy but the convention hasnt started yet so we need to follow procedure
7343643 i dont think barack would do it or hillary would accept
7343644 it would have been smart of him to name her as his sidekick because she got half the vote
7343645 there are going to be a significant number of people who are going to hold a grudge
7343646 im disappointed as it apparently seems that in the race for the white house its a mans world after all
7343647 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7343648 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7343649 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7343650 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7343651 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7343652 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7343653 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7343654 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7343655 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7343656 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7343657 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7343658 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7343659 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7343660 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7343661 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7343662 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7343663 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7343664 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7343665 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7343666 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so
7343667 its videos such as this when i am reminded why we are fighting notice how ron doesnt even flinch when asked some of these very tough questions
7343668 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7343669 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7343670 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7343671 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7343672 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7343673 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7343674 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7343675 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7343676 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7343677 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7343678 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7343679 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7343680 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7343681 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7343682 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7343683 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7343684 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7343685 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7343686 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7343687 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7343688 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7343689 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7343690 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7343691 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7343692 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7343693 whether or not our next president and congress dismantle empire usa plus turning things around here at home
7343694 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7343695 online advocacy what it is whats out there whats working what needs work
7343696 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7343697 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7343698 you can just hire a few newly unemployed coders who are familiar with the code to finish off the job for you
7343699 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7343700 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7343701 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7343702 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7343703 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7343704 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7343705 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7343706 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7343707 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7343708 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7343709 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7343710 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7343711 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7343712 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7343713 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7343714 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7343715 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7343716 this is my comment lets hope its not foolish or poorly received
7343717 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7343718 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7343719 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7343720 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7343721 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7343722 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7343723 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7343724 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7343725 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7343726 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7343727 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7343728 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7343729 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7343730 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7343731 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7343732 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7343733 our results conclusively prove there is a causal relationship between immunization schedules and diabetes
7343734 the recent data shows that common childhood vaccines are especially dangerous to children with a strong family history of diabetes
7343735 parents of a child with a strong family history of insulin dependent diabetes should know that the administration of a full series of vaccines may have a greater than 5 percent chance of causing their child to develop diabetes
7343736 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7343737 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7343738 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7343739 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7343740 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7343741 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7343742 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7343743 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7343744 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7343745 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7343746 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7343747 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7343748 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7343749 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7343750 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7343751 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7343752 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7343753 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7343754 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7343755 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7343756 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems

7343773 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7343774 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7343775 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7343776 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7343777 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7343778 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7343779 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7343780 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7343781 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7343782 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7343783 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7343784 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7343785 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7343786 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7343787 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7343788 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7343789 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7343790 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7343791 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7343792 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people

7343814 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7343815 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7343816 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7343817 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7343818 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7343819 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7343820 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7343821 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7343822 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7343823 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7343824 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7343825 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7343826 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

7343829 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7343830 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7343831 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7343832 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7343833 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
7343834 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
7343835 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
7343836 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
7343837 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
7343838 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
7343839 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature

7343841 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
7343842 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7343843 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7343844 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7343845 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7343846 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens

7343852 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7343853 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7343854 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7343855 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies

7343863 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
7343864 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
7343865 this book is an excellent learning tool like any other tool you get out of it exactly what you put in my advice is to spend as much time with each section as you need if you do that you will walk away with every bit of the knowledge an industry thought leader can provide

7343868 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7343869 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7343870 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7343871 is offering us the kind of vision and sense of urgency that has been so lacking in the presidential campaigns
7343872 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7343873 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7343874 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7343875 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you

7343878 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7343879 there comes a time when youve got to go to the barricades and let it rip both gore and kerry were eviscerated on personal grounds by their opponents campaigns
7343880 it is really important that obama responds to the charge that he is elitist democrats dont want the criticisms to take hold and affect public opinion
7343881 i sometimes struggle just to get the essentials you know the milk the bread the eggs
7343882 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
7343883 just because the other side is fighting dirty it doesnt mean we have to stoop to their level
7343884 if we are going to win this election then we have to live up to our promise that we represent a new kind of politics
7343885 these attacks can be unpleasant and a cause of anxiety but this exchange is important its very informative for voters the american public needs to know not only if obama can take a punch but if he can throw one the image of obama is that he is cerebral he needs to show that he has a gut instinct and that he can be a street fighter
7343886 heres one house american cant afford to let john mccain move into
7343887 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
7343888 the boston tea party supports reducing the size scope and power of government at all levels and on all issues

7343896 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7343897 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7343898 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7343899 just look at this incredible cashmerino can you believe the woman only wanted fifty cents a skein what a fool or b trade with stash leave behinds brought by other members i was thinking we could pool those yarns that
7343900 the fire took place in the generator which is located in a conventional building that is separate from the reactor
7343901 all security systems of the installation operated as expected and they were not affected by the fire at this moment the reactor is stopped and stable the event did not have any impact on workers or the environment
7343902 we all agree whether we are for or against nuclear power that it should be safe and that means there can be no manipulation or covering up
7343903 the reports weve received so far say guatemalans and americans were aboard the aircraft for a total of 14 including passengers and crew
7343904 i think after the auckland game we talked about how our lineout had been going for the past 12 months prior rather than that one game
7343905 you dont become a bad lineout overnight or a good lineout over night
7343906 we talked about what wed done well in the first five or six games before that auckland test and went back to what we saw as our strengths and that worked for us
7343907 to lose vicks pretty early on we did a lot of work on our lineout throughout the week obviously with him running the show and for those guys to come in and hold it together for the rest of the game was full credit to jimmy horwill and to mummy as well when he came on
7343908 its disappointing to have to postpone the tournament but in the end it was a rigorous process that was followed and in the end the security advice around pakistan has just been too tough to overcome
7343909 we wanted to see the process run its course and in the end we didnt have to make a call
7343910 the weight of opinion from around the world meant that it was an obvious choice
7343911 you couldnt hold a good world event in pakistan at the moment the right decision has been made and everyones pretty comfortable with it
7343912 the decision was due to a circumstance in that country that was out of the control of the local cricket board
7343913 i think the whole of the icc feels for pakistan at the moment but their country is in a significant amount of turmoil their president has just resigned and there are a lot of bombs going off
7343914 those sort of things really arent conducive for a world cricketing event
7343915 it is extremely difficult to know for sure how many people were caught up in the avalanche

7343929 we have activated our teams as a precautionary measure for the safety of the public
7343930 we are ready to close the gates and run the pumps should the need arise
7343931 but fay could become nearly stationary or stall on monday over eastern louisiana and southern mississippi
7343932 we have directed our militants to stop attacks against the government and security forces in bajaur from today
7343933 the jirga elders council insisted taliban should stop fighting in the interest of the people of bajaur
7343934 we are ready for talks with the government and the truce is an important development towards dialogue
7343935 we do not believe in their verbal commitments if they are sincere they should first surrender
7343936 five militants were killed in the mortar fire targeting suspected militant hideouts

7343944 no withdrawal has been mentioned today the russians are keeping all their previous illegal checkpoints
7343945 people are coming back bit by bit still not everyone is back but we are getting back to normal
7343946 but we are still scared how can we be sure there is not going to be another war the russian troops have only gone back 10km outside the city
7343947 it is extremely difficult to know for sure how many people were caught up in the avalanche

7343955 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7343956 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7343957 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified

7344110 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7344111 the game didnt really go our way in that second half but we hung in there and kelly made a big play to win the game
7344112 thats what winning teams do i thought uncg played a terrific second half they put us under lot of pressure like wake did but in a different way they had a lot of good second efforts and they played some good soccer it was definitely a positive for us that we could withstand that that is a great quality to have in your team and after two games we can tell that we have it within our group this year on the game winning strike isleib received a pass from sophomore midfielder near the top of the uncg penalty box took a touch past a defender and lined up the strike isleib let it fly finding the bottom left corner of the goal propelling the utes to their first victory of the 2008 season the goal was the second of the season for isleib who also tallied utahs only goal in fridays 2 1 overtime loss to no 21 wake forest lauren hair and i thought she was going to shoot it
7344113 but then she pulled it back and played it to me so i touched it around the defender and pulled the trigger i saw their goalkeeper was shading to the right because it was on my right foot so i just aimed for the left and found the side netting
7344114 kelly is an upperclassman now and she has started to feel comfortable taking responsibility and helping the team win games
7344115 i thought friday night against wake forest she did a fantastic job of managing the game in the second half and being our leader today she played about four different positions and was able to move around comfortably in them all at the end of the day good players make good plays when it counts
7344116 it felt really good to help the team and give us something to build off of
7344117 after katy played it in amanda had a shot deflect off of a defender and rebound straight to me and i got really excited i saw that no one was at the far post so i just tried to hit it as hard as i could so that if it didnt go in we might still have another chance at it
7344118 we made some really nice plays around the box im not sure we necessarily solved what they presented to us but to be able to hang in there under those circumstances was definitely a positive individually lauren porter did a nice job as well we just kept hanging in there
7344119 we are always happy to win one on the road i dont think we won more than one game outside the state of utah last year
7344120 it was nice to once again find out more about ourselves i think we are still just trying to find the positions formation and strategy to help us use all of the qualities we have we took some steps this weekend and found out what some of these players can do and now we can go back and train on that got her first action in the second half and was solid along with getting our players in and seeing what they can do is big deal
7344121 it was a hard back and forth game i think we had the majority of the first half possession but in the second half they did a lot of moving and running winning 50 50 balls and it was hard for us to transition when playing so much defense but we stuck in there and gave it everything we had we played awesome defense we were strong in our tackles and some players stepped up we had some players get hurt and a few others stepped in and played really well sometimes a game like this rolls your way like today and other times it doesnt like friday night
7344122 it feels nice last year i didnt have the greatest scoring season but i had a lot of assists and i will never take those for granted goals and assists go hand in hand but i appreciate morgan playing the ball to me instead of hitting it thats probably what i would have done last year to have two goals in two games kind of takes the pressure off a little bit
7344123 top o the morning to ye nice to be back and all and some other stuff too
7344124 mi estrategia fue mantener un ritmo bastante fuerte desde el inicio despu s redoblar el esfuerzo sobre el final y el triunfo se lo dedico a mi mam que siempre me incentiva para que siga en el atletismo as que gracias a ella hoy pude ganar
7344125 ya particip en varias competencias de atletismo ahora estar en el campeonato provincial y mi objetivo es poder clasificar para el nacional
7344126 es una l stima que no tengamos representantes en argentina tenemos a varios deportistas muy buenos pero por carencias econ micas no pueden ir
7344127 esta es la segunda vez que participo en eldorado el a o pasado termin tercera y esta temporada ten a que poner todo porque ven a entrenando muy fuerte en un principio me pareci muy linda la prueba porque hab a un buen clima luego sali el sol hizo mucho m s calor pero por suerte la pude sobrellevar
7344128 cada uno elabora su manera para competir pero creo que para todos los ltimos metros fueron los m s exigentes porque todos apuran el ritmo ahora tengo que pensar en la prueba por la fiesta del inmigrante de ober pero mi idea es apuntar al campenato nacional juvenil que se llevar a cabo en salta
7344129 creo que es penoso el nivel demostrado en los panamericanos fue bueno pero los atletas tienen que solventarse solos todos los gastos adem s ser un deporte amateur ya juega en contra porque el trabajo ya es un desgaste una ocupaci n m s en la mente el atletismo es una actividad en la que uno se debe dedicar al cien por ciento
7344130 vine desde san pablo para esta competencia y posiblemente otra tambi n en argentina ya estuve el a o pasado y me gust fui cuarto y entonces ten a que regresar para intentar llevarme el primer puesto mi objetivo es siempre ser primero
7344131 gan porque soy muy fuerte mis oponentes tambi n sobre el final dar o pi eyro quien termin segundo me persegu a muy de cerca as que en los ltimos metros tuve que apresurar el paso
7344132 en los ltimo a os evolucion mucho el atletismo en mi pa s aun falta mucho para mejorar pero est mejor que antes sin embargo se le tiene que dar m s valor a los atletas este deporte en general tiene poco apoyo y esto es as en toda sudam rica y la verdad no s por qu creo que el pueblo no le da credibilidad al atletismo como profesi n es un trabajo igual que otro deporte como el f tbol o el automovilismo nosotros sufrimos y peleamos en busca del mismo objetivo ganar un t tulo ser campe n y representar a nuestro pa s
7344133 estamos felices y muy contentos fue una fiesta largaron un total de 3300 participantes en la categor a general y aproximadamente 1100 en las series de las escuelas con estos n meros pr cticamente duplicamos la cantidad de la edici n del a o pasado
7344134 estamos muy contentos por la ayuda de nuestros sponsors en total recaudamos algo m s que 70 mil pesos lo que se volcar al rea de pediatr a del hospital samic de eldorado y el de esperanza adem s al programa de desnutrici n infantil de la capital del trabajo fueron muchas las empresas que nos dieron una mano por lo que estamos muy agradecidos y esperamos que sigan participando en las pr ximas ediciones

7344148 ik vind trouwens erger wat er met yannick driesen gebeurde die wel naar estudiantes madrid getransfereerd werd maar er na zijn seizoen bij een satellietploeg niks bijleerde daar moet dringend aan gewerkt worden want met hem kunnen we naar een ek net zoals met jongens als van rossom oveneke of axel hervelle die zodanig goed revalideert dat we hem deze week verwachten hij kreeg daarvoor toestemming van real madrid

7344160 use it lose it or save it the science of renewable energy storage
7344161 the science will take time to mature but with legislative and economic shelters to nurture it scientists and engineers can develop better ways to store electrical energy
7344162 at some point we will reach a point where renewables make up the largest portion of our energy sources but we have to solve this storage problem first
7344163 we have a chance to get in on the ground floor now though before we create a big mess

7344199 i quotidiani nei giorni scorsi hanno riportato la notizia di numerosi cittadini che si sono visti recapitare direttamente a domicilio verbali della polizia municipale con la contravvenzione di 160 per aver violato uno dei divieti imposti dal regolamento di polizia municipale come per esempio aver steso i panni ad asciugare sul lato prospicente la via pubblica o per aver collocato la bici in sosta fuori dalle rastrelliere che peraltro non cerano dichiarano luca ragazzo capogruppo dei verdi in provincia e tommaso grassi portavoce provinciale e capogruppo al quartiere 5 in questi giorni di vacanze gli agenti di polizia municipale con tanta solerzia hanno applicato le sanzioni previste dal nuovo regolamento che peraltro la gran parte dei cittadini neppure conosce ed davvero singolare scoprire che in realt il nuovo regolamento ad oggi non ancora esecutivo
7344200 dall11 agosto il comune di firenze sta applicando il nuovo regolamento di polizia municipale ribattezzato sotto leufemistica dizione di
7344201 le deliberazioni diventano esecutive dopo il decimo giorno dalla loro pubblicazione
7344202 tutte le deliberazioni del comune sono pubblicate mediante affissione per quindici giorni consecutivi rilevano i due verdi il ministero dellinterno ha emesso parere interpretativo il 22 marzo e il 13 settembre 2006 rispondendo a specifici quesiti sulla
7344203 il periodo di dieci giorni necessari per lesecutivit delle deliberazioni stesse andr a decorrere dal giorno 16 successivo al completamento del periodo di pubblicazione
7344204 nel caso del regolamento di firenze non essendo stata votata in consiglio comunale la immediata esecutivit i 10 giorni quindi non possono che decorrere dal 16 giorno come confermato anche dal parere espresso dal coordinatore del dipartimento giuridico dei verdi dott
7344205 quanto accaduto finora devono riconoscere lassessore cioni e il comandante bartolini sintomo del mancato equilibrio tra la necessit di innalzare il livello di coscienza civile anche attraverso losservanza di regole e la sensibilit alla giustizia e allequit degli interventi sanzionatori fanno notare ragazzo e grassi avevamo ragione quando abbiamo sostenuto prima dellapprovazione in consiglio comunale che il regolamento imponeva nuovi divieti e nuove norme difficilmente digeribili in poco tempo da cittadini e che affidava poteri totalmente discrezionali alla polizia municipale che in questi giorni hanno prodotto un inutile e folle persecuzione degli abitanti di firenze
7344206 chi fosse stato multato concludono rendendosi disponibili verso i cittadini potr ricorrere per richiedere lannullamento della sanzione inflitta dagli agenti di polizia municipale in missione punitiva portando i pareri del ministero che forniremo a chiunque ce li richieda a propria difesa
7344207 come al solito la sinistra non finisce di stupire sul regolamento di polizia urbana

7344218 the resource management act requires people to be involved in the decision making process and we dont see why cellphone towers should be exempt from that
7344219 what we are looking for is that new zealand is international best practice instead of international worst practice
7344220 we noticed business traffic had decreased from some firms especially in banking and finance we needed to stay ahead of the curve
7344221 the aim of all this is to make the hotel more pleasing to the eyes and offer more services than our competitors
7344222 through the first half of august preliminary numbers indicate that demand room nights sold is down room revenue growth is slowing and supply growth continues
7344223 now that the economy has taken a bit of a tumble we are glad we have it
7344224 it helps our ability to attract groups to stamford we try to get people to have events within stamford rather than new york or new jersey
7344225 we feel like we had a good time in the market but we always have to be ready for a downturn
7344226 we dont know how many there are but they are in decline theyve gone from a lot of places around new zealand and we do know that some of that is human induced
7344227 defeating me like you did is one thing but then unarmed you leveled those three guys in the next fight
7344228 those are three of the best martial artists in the world
7344229 ive seen the resumes of those three two of them taught at schools in asia and one of them teaches in a school here in gotham city they teach or have taught at the best schools in the world theyve won many competitions they were armed they outnumbered you three to one you had just come out of a fight with me granted that probably wasnt too difficult for you but it should have tired you out at least a little and then you went through those three men like they were nothing how do you do that
7344230 master bruce i think i shall bring us all some tea have you had breakfast sir
7344231 i am a little hungry if you are offering to bring something down to the batcave
7344232 i was hoping it would be for three i would like to go over a few things with the two of you while were eating
7344233 i shall be delighted to join the two of you sir
7344234 those men have had the best training money can buy
7344235 the training i received cant be bought its not for sale not at any price
7344236 the instructor i studied with didnt teach me any moves or anything like that i had already learned nearly all of that when i was with him
7344237 he taught me things that transcend the mechanics of fighting
7344238 the mayors race is now between two candidates one councilman mcmullen is seen as stronger in the war on crime because of his experience in law enforcement however many gotham residents favor his opponent councilman salama who is younger because they want some fresh ideas mcmullen has been in gotham politics a long time serving on the city council for two decades now while salama hasnt even completed one term on the city council
7344239 some see salama as a young upstart and question his experience the pundits have suggested that it was a smart move on salamas part naming an experienced city council member as his running mate with councilman lidden as vice mayor that would compliment salamas perceived inexperience although it has been suggested that this may also co opt the freshness of his ideas
7344240 an investigative report tied mcmullen to an organized crime cartel that is connected with the demon they traffic hard narcotics guns they control prostitution and have been involved in trafficking women for forced prostitution it is a very violent cartel and one of the cartels front organizations has been active in political fund raising for mcmullen
7344241 salama has for many years been a front man for this guy a billionaire who believes narcotics should be legalized and
7344242 lidden too has been connected to narcotics traffickers who in turn are connected to the demon
7344243 so the mayors race is a proxy fight for control of the heroin trade
7344244 in part yes of course many other things are at stake and many of those other things are legal but drugs play a big part in this election cycle
7344245 i had a chance to meet the instructor who taught my teacher back when my teacher was young i didnt catch this instructors name in fact i dont even know if he has one he was an old man even then when my teacher was in training
7344246 when the communists took over in that country decades ago this instructor was an old man
7344247 this same guy you met the guy who taught your teacher
7344248 the communists had lists of people they were rounding up and this guys name must have been on one of their lists they sent a squad of soldiers into the village one day and surrounded him they looked him over closely then told him to go with them
7344249 in my country too many people disappeared because of the communists
7344250 do you mean he got away and hid from them
7344251 no hiding is for children i mean he disappeared right before their eyes
7344252 the communist soldiers were so scared they never came back to the village
7344253 bold thing to do but maybe its not too far away
7344254 tougher line on attendance and have clearly defined what a justifiable absence is and what truancy is
7344255 some of you may be surprised to hear that if you take your child on an overseas trip in school time this is considered an unjustified absence and therefore your children are recorded as truant
7344256 but we dont want to be on the wrong side of the rules and have a truancy officer knock on our door
7344257 there needs to be more of an evaluation of cases based on the student and family and commitment to learning

7344263 nato itself would have been discredited for failing to defend the very values that give it meaning
7344264 the norms of law cannot be interpreted narrowly formally in isolation from the general context of the modern world
7344265 by direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power we will not hesitate to act alone if necessary to exercise our right of self defense by acting pre emptively
7344266 to keep military strength beyond challenge thereby making the destabilizing arms races of other eras pointless and limiting rivalries to trade and other pursuits of peace
7344267 history has called america and our allies to action and it is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedoms fight
7344268 weve come to know truths that we will never question evil is real and it must be opposed rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or consequential

7344272 he thought he was almost invincible but he was very careful after that

7344278 hogs are a good animal to take to the fair
7344279 it doesnt take too much work to take care of them theyre easy to show they are fun to show the judges look at their anatomy how theyre built in showmanship they look at how you handle the animal and how youre dressed
7344280 you get to help people learning about farming you get to help younger 4 h members and you get to help with the fair i like the fair i spend every single day at the fair
7344281 the ffa it gets kids who arent interested in sports involved with something
7344282 it gives kids who farm some kind of activity to be in you also get to learn hands on stuff without going to a vocational school

7344298 this very important discovery not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7344299 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7344300 because there are already drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma

7344492 there is an healthy pull pulling both corporate communications marketing and agencies vendors up to new heights faster and faster
7344493 where have you been my friend to the thought that the digital guys are going to be any better theyre also mostly tied up with old ideas about influence and information being a key driver of behaviour
7344494 when you look at this changes in context of the challenges for the cmos then suddenly the urgency and seriousness of the problem facing ad and marketing agencies becomes quite stark
7344495 were not excusing the industrys slow move to digital or failure to pick up on some of the changes in consumer culture but its not always within our control trust we wish it was
7344496 i do think its hard to consider the future of the agency business without recognising that the media agencies or at least some of them are driving real change for their clients

7344503 one major problem with advertising agencies is that theyre exceptional at believing their own bullshit
7344504 i would argue if you have that experience skills and aptitudes then transposing them into the new techniques and channels offered by social media is a lot simpler than trying to come at it from the direction of the advertising agency
7344505 as communities amp conversations become more and more important there is a need to understand how to build analytical models around huge
7344506 how much can an agency facilitate conversations and nurture connections i feel this is primarily a job for the brands themselves
7344507 despite the wealth of information out there distilling it into useful actionable insight isnt easy and in fact its one area where old school disciplines can help new media and digital mature as a discipline
7344508 agency expertise has always tended to be siloed so things really become interesting when you connect media behavior with front end data for segmentation and predictive modeling with back end website analytics suddenly a different picture starts to form
7344509 we are living in an age of repersonalization and individualization people products and services are all seeking an individual identity taste desire ambition and lifestyle have made shopping once again a form of personal expression a computer can know and remember as much marketing detail about 200 000 000 consumers as did the owner of a crossroads general store about his handful of customers it can know an select such personal details as who prefers strong coffee imported beer new fashions bright colors who just bought a home freezer camera automobile who had a new baby is overweight got married owns a pet likes romantic novels serious reading listens to bach or the beatles new marketing forms which will link these facts to advertising and selling must evolve where advertising and buying become a single action

7344519 google is still a founder driven company engineers are usually not crazy about marketing people taking soundbites and pieces where the company comes from leads to interesting things organizing the worlds information is the worlds largest hack a display of ability its an amazing creative space the core behind that is an almost quixotic a bold moonshot type of spirit thats at the center its less competitive than sort of aspirational that takes a lot of communication and translation to people who dont live at the center of that community

7344549 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7344550 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7344551 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7344552 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7344553 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7344554 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7344555 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7344556 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7344557 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7344558 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7344559 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7344560 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7344561 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7344562 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7344563 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7344564 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7344565 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7344566 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7344567 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7344568 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7344569 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7344570 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7344571 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7344572 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7344573 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7344574 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7344575 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7344576 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7344577 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7344578 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7344579 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7344580 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7344581 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7344582 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7344583 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7344584 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7344585 who are open to doing something on the production side
7344586 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7344587 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7344588 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7344589 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7344590 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7344591 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7344592 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7344593 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7344594 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7344595 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7344596 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7344597 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7344598 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7344599 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7344600 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7344601 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7344602 jo fordi sidst jeg fik taget s dan en var l gen lige ved at sk re min finger af

7344610 i could take this rainy overcast weather for a few more days nice and cool for a change
7344611 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7344612 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7344613 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7344614 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7344615 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7344616 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7344617 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7344618 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7344619 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7344620 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7344621 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7344622 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7344623 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7344624 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7344625 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7344626 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7344627 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7344628 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7344629 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7344630 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7344631 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7344632 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7344633 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7344634 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7344635 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7344636 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

7344710 i just want to i just wanted to make the comment ive worked with joe biden
7344711 ive seen his leadership i have absolutely no doubt about what is in his heart and the commitment that hes made with respect to racial equality in this country so i will provide some testimony as they say in church that joe is on the right side of the issues and is fighting every day for a better america

7344737 a bloody next act in a screenplay that could be named how to destroy the investment story of one of the strongest credits in the emerging markets universe
7344738 people who were among the most bullish on russia are now ready to be the most aggressive in demonizing it
7344739 the speaker was never in any danger and she appreciates the quick and professional response of the police
7344740 had to share how excited i am on sunday mornings to see so much happening at the end of our services i love a baptism every week and not just quarterly i know there is extra work involved to get things ready but it is such am impact on those of us in the pews a weekly reminder of our own big event and a fresh testimony to anyone sitting on the fence these victories are what it is all about yeah i needed to share how awesome god is working in our midst
7344741 if the protecteur and preserver are going to be needed longer than expected we will also determine what needs to be done to keep our supply ships safe operational and available until they can be replaced
7344742 many of their systems are nearly obsolete such as the boilers they use to generate steam for main propulsion as you might expect its becoming increasingly difficult and costly to maintain these ships spare parts are no longer readily available and the skills needed to operate and maintain systems that were already mature in the 1960s are becoming increasingly rare
7344743 current international conventions require comparable commercial ships tankers to have double hulls and canadian environmental policy aims where feasible for warships to incorporate the highest pollution prevention standards
7344744 the bidders were significantly over the budget so we just cut the process and were looking at the next steps
7344745 we want to have the best value for taxpayers dollars the budget is a major consideration and we have to act responsibly
7344746 we see a lot of atv injuries weve been seeing them more as the economys been booming out here and were seeing them in all age groups not just young kids
7344747 people are going to start crying saying its a provincial regulation because its transportation related and we dont want the feds involved
7344748 yet youve got a patchwork framework across the country that is not only very confusing but is not based on any science whatsoever
7344749 its based on public opinion and its based on political lack of will to do anything about the issue
7344750 one of the things that we would like to see and were part of a national association is a little bit of standardization going on
7344751 the regulations are so fractured across this country its hard to keep track
7344752 we definitely need to pull this all together across the country
7344753 man i need to go home and catch up on some blogs
7344754 were out here to speak out about the destruction of society and the impact on our own society as we have fewer and fewer resources
7344755 this is one of the primary gatherings this week thats expected thats for peace
7344756 were young kids and we dont want to see our futures turn into s
7344757 i think the re create 68 events are going to get everyone together and feeling the same thing
7344758 coalition forces are investigating these claims but have not been able to find any evidence that non combatants were killed in this engagement
7344759 the taliban and their supporters are running a very effective propaganda campaign to counter coalition efforts in western afghanistan
7344760 we did see an afghan woman and her child wounded in the crossfire being treated by an afghan commando and u s medics
7344761 and we saw them evacuated to a coalition hospital for treatment
7344762 i hope the same mask that protected me in beijing will help him protect his people
7344763 some italian athletes autonomously and without renouncing their commitment to sports made a symbolic gesture in favor of tibet and the dalai lama
7344764 in the field of great conquests for civil rights public opinion makes the difference and to move public opinion the gesture of an athlete is more important than the gesture
7344765 it was my six days of being well it was like a trance it was so wonderful it was so great to be with my daughter again
7344766 you know i lost i lost big time in boston
7344767 in light of mr gerhartsreiters history of deceitful behavior any statements made by him should be viewed with extreme skepticism
7344768 a tip from a source close to microsofts marketing department
7344769 oh my god i love it thats so and sos little brother bradleys car
7344770 i just think its weird that ive been wanting a chevelle for so long and then all the sudden her fianc wants one
7344771 so youre getting back together with the ex but youre with james right now man oh man
7344772 banks and credit card companies to tilt the playing field in their favor at the expense of hardworking americans
7344773 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7344774 you cannot go into a 7 11 or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent oh im not joking
7344775 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7344776 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7344777 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7344778 i am a zionist you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
7344779 we cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
7344780 the truth of the matter is it is going to become a subject if in fact theres a 40 per cent shortfall in recruitment its just a reality
7344781 not only to change the direction of america but literally literally to change the direction of the world
7344782 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night before you put the kids after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7344783 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7344784 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7344785 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night before you put the kids after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7344786 the real reason is secret service protection for my two girls as they enter into their teenaged years
7344787 whatever young guy comes by for a date were going to have one of these mean looking guys who dont crack a smile theyre armed theyre dangerous
7344788 la lotta al terrorismo ha ancora bisogno della comunit internazionale
7344789 essi ci stanno facendo onore stanno portando la bandiera italiana come bandiera di pace contro il terrorismo e linstabilit
7344790 why in the heck do you have it so cold in here
7344791 ill go back in and see if i can find out anything
7344792 i miss you i love you i want to see you when i come down there next week
7344793 i really dont think you should txt or call me because its not fair to me
7344794 fuck you man thats bullshit have fun with your cheerleader
7344795 oh shit shake that ass ma move it like a gypsy
7344796 declaramos alerta roja a los hospitales fern ndez rivadavia y argerich y enviamos doce ambulancias del sistema al lugar evacuamos un total de 15 pacientes con politraumatismos diversos leves y todos fuera de peligro
7344797 los heridos son por golpes con los asientos ca das y esguinces de tobillo adem s hemos atendido a una embarazada y a otra paciente con traumatismo de hombro que son un poco m s importantes pero el resto est n siendo atendidos en las guardias de los hospitales mencionados
7344798 i will only be happy if they get substantial convictions
7344799 it will always be somewhere in the back of his mind and im sure it takes part in some of his dreams
7344800 it was a terrible thing to happen that should never have happened
7344801 if we call our case we lose that last kick at the cat opportunity as well
7344802 by not calling evidence the crown has to draw all the strings together and try and come up with a common thread and then we have an opportunity to hear the entirety of that argument before we make ours
7344803 in general theres a circumstantial body of evidence that the crown is going to rely on and suggest that it is sufficient to prove his involvement
7344804 obviously the man was kidnapped its a question of who did it or if you will what involvement they had
7344805 i might have something to say after the verdict but not now
7344806 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of world
7344807 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7344808 ancak bu iddialar kul be yak n kaynaklarca do rulanmad
7344809 biz k yt r k bir haber yapt k ordan burdan duyduklar m zla ama hi kimse bunu do rulamad ehhehehe
7344810 este fue el mejor partido desde que llegu a racing ahora solamente quiero hablar de f tbol porque de mi continuidad lo haremos m s adelante
7344811 quiero agradecer el esfuerzo de los jugadores porque hoy nos patearon solamente dos veces al arco fuimos superiores a independiente y no tendr amos que haber empatado sino ganado
7344812 en cuanto a independiente creo que claudio borghi jug un poco con el resultado e intent sacarle ritmo al partido achicar los espacios y no le sali mal no se lo puede juzgar porque quiso preservar la ventaja que ten a en el marcador
7344813 este es un club en el que hay mucho por hacer una instituci n que te genera muchas emociones y te involucras en eso por eso hoy estoy muy feliz por lo que hicieron los jugadores racing jug como yo quiero
7344814 en los ltimos tiempos se subestima mucho a la instituci n y no se le da el valor que tiene por historia y por su gente estoy feliz como t cnico y quiero hablar con la gente cercana para que me ayuden a pensar
7344815 nunca tuve tomada una decisi n este es un plantel en crecimiento y hay que ver como se suceden las cosas
7344816 many have considered automatic multi instrument conversion to be the holy grail of music recognition
7344817 it was an amazing moment for everybody in that room
7344818 a transforming moment where you could see in the eyes of afghanis who had thought they had lost their heritage of western scholars including myself who thought that we would never ever see these treasures there they were
7344819 its remarkable that a secret is something known by one person
7344820 and once its known by more than one its no longer a secret
7344821 well it was known by this small group of people and i know that many many people asked them about the whereabouts of these collections and its something about the noble character of afghans that they kept their secret
7344822 they were found by a series of farmers in northern afghanistan who had no idea that these were 4 000 year old treasures
7344823 and they were so happy with their good luck of having found these golden bowls that they immediately started to divide up their good luck
7344824 its completely iconic of the kind of art that the greeks would bring to the afghan area to impose and to show their culture and it became part of the fabric of the art of afghanistan
7344825 absolutely there is in fact no road its a series of caravans serais those are trading places which are connected by traders and they go east and west connecting rome with china but also north and south connecting siberia and russia
7344826 theres a real sense of a kind of universal design that goes back to pre history practically
7344827 and i think its important to understand that afghanistan was a critical link in trade in cultures east and west as much two thousand years ago as it is today
7344828 the future of afghanistan looks pretty bleak theres no indication that this country like its history is going to be much different
7344829 well morley ill have to admit that im perhaps an impossible optimist
7344830 but actually i see a lot of hope in afghanistan
7344831 its simply a fact much of its wealth is based on illicit trade of drugs and warlords still seem to rule the day
7344832 thats why i actually think that an exhibition about the ancient culture of afghanistan about the heritage about giving afghans their sense of pride is so important not only for us here in the united states but for people back in afghanistan
7344833 a nation stays alive when its culture and history stay alive
7344834 the largest experiment to try and produce a forecast of the climate in the 21st century
7344835 the state of the switch whether it is on or off is like a computer memory that can store a bit of 0 or 1 although real biological switches are quite complex and regulated in many ways we have shown the simplest possible ways in which switches could work
7344836 our exploration using system x is rather like how a tinkerer or a kid puts together things to see if they do something useful we took a lot of spare parts each spare part being one chemical reaction connected them together every which way and we found that a surprising number of these artificially constructed networks actually were switches
7344837 popular opinion used to be that there are a small number of ways in which switches can be realized by biology but we found thousands of switches in our search
7344838 this has important implications since it suggests how evolution might stumble upon a switch rather easily
7344839 but switching and memory are the most basic behaviors possible armed with our catalog of switches we can now proceed to investigate more interesting behaviors like complex information processing
7344840 many new drugs being made today are antibodies but they are extremely expensive to make financially the u s health care system is going to have a difficult time accommodating the next 500 drugs being antibodies
7344841 our results show that a peptoid can attack a harmful receptor in the body with the same precision as an antibody but would cost much less to develop
7344842 our technique is simple and fast works with existing chemicals and needs no high tech instrumentation except for a microscope to detect the fluorescent colors we use to sort the compounds
7344843 this new technique of rapidly isolating biologically active peptoids offers a way to hasten the drug discovery process and may ultimately benefit patients by providing them
7344844 for years a fundamental question in cell biology has gone largely unanswered what proteins function in mitochondria
7344845 by creating a comprehensive list we now have a valuable resource that has already helped enhance our understanding of mitochondrial biology and disease
7344846 the technologies and analytical methods for measuring proteins on a large scale are really transforming what we can learn about human biology
7344847 by applying them to mitochondria isolated from fourteen different mouse tissues weve completed one of the most comprehensive proteomic analyses of any organelle to date
7344848 proteins with similar roles often share similar histories meaning theyre gained or lost together during evolution
7344849 we decided to use this tendency to our advantage to decipher how some mitochondrial proteins work
7344850 our finding underscores the power of this protein catalogue to open new vistas on disease
7344851 it promises to shed light not only on rare metabolic diseases but common diseases as well
7344852 i dont remember a santa monica boulevard in richmond va
7344853 yes terry please go spend more time with your family
7344854 im here to talk to georgian leaders and our u s assessment team to hear what they need
7344855 we have to get it right so we can help people quickly we want to optimize the humanitarian aid effort and bring in the right stuff to the right place at the right time
7344856 we express our gratitude for your help and will never forget what you have done to help us in our time of need
7344857 there is an agreement between two heads of state and there has to be compliance
7344858 my assessment is that the russian withdrawal is now slower than it ought to be the russians need to do what they said they were going to do almost a week ago and withdraw
7344859 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7344860 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7344861 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7344862 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7344863 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7344864 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7344865 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7344866 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7344867 they say that our aggression our toughness came out of our slave situation
7344868 considering that jamaica had more slavery rebellion than any country in the world
7344869 its not a question of genetic pool but we have that
7344870 its a cultural thing too that we want to achieve
7344871 i think that he knows full well that his athletes have been using drugs
7344872 he set out to set up a lab to cheat they caught him he went to prison and now hes casting aspersions on other people who have stayed in this sport the last 40 years and have been clean
7344873 from 1948 until now we have been coming to the olympics in sprints ok and we have done well this is just a culmination of what has gone on for more than 40 years
7344874 which is difficult to translate exactly but could be said to mean though we may be small we are powerful beyond expectations
7344875 at the end of the day though there is a culture of track that the jamaicans have now mastered at a very high level
7344876 if usain bolt were born in north america or europe he would be now earning far more money as a professional basketball player with the odds of a much longer and more lucrative career
7344877 once upon a time they were saying we have it because we have fast fibers
7344878 so i said to them how many countries have fast fibers only a few areas in the world ah these are theories that dont hold strong when you have a complex situation
7344879 we passed exams at universities abroad because of the strength where other blacks failed
7344880 we feel because other people are now caught the playing field is now more level for us
7344881 all of them trained in the states and we caught them down in kingston
7344882 you remember that guy who believed in god so strongly
7344883 our athletes are strong believers in the almighty they believe that without the almighty they can do nothing and with the almighty they actually can do everything
7344884 we know that our athletes have trained hard that the country would not tolerate any kind of cheating because we are a moral christian country
7344885 wired americans hear more points of view about candidates and key issues than other citizens they are not using the internet to screen out ideas with which they disagree
7344886 internet use did have an indepedent and positive effect on the number of statements people heard about the candidates
7344887 the right is trying to sell argument a heres why its wrong
7344888 are not using the internet to screen out ideas with which they disagree
7344889 self segregation or deliberation blog readership participation in american politics
7344890 knowing the other sides key arguments isnt the same thing as good faith deliberation
7344891 are not using the internet to screen out ideas with which they disagree
7344892 three months ago an earthquake struck chinas sichuan province killing nearly 70 000 people to my eyes this part of the region looks forlorn
7344893 i asked if people in the village have suffered any psychological aftershocks from the trauma another villager tan fubian piped up and said that they just try not to think about it these were weird unnerving interviews and i dont pretend to understand whats going on in the minds of people who have suffered such blows and remained so optimistic all i can imagine is that the history of this province has given these people a stripped down pragmatic mentality move on or go crazy dont dwell look to the positive fix what needs fixing work together
7344894 i dont know if its emotionally sustainable or even healthy but it raises at least one interesting question when you compare these people to the emotional sturm und drang over lesser things on reality tv you do wonder if we americans are a nation of whiners
7344895 for everyone who poured their time energy and creativity into the making of this project i give my sincerest congratulations
7344896 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7344897 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7344898 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7344899 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7344900 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7344901 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7344902 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7344903 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7344904 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7344905 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7344906 i made some mistakes but i think it is normal after winning five world championships in a row
7344907 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7344908 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7344909 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7344910 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7344911 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7344912 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7344913 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7344914 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7344915 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7344916 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7344917 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7344918 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7344919 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7344920 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7344921 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7344922 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7344923 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7344924 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7344925 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7344926 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7344927 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7344928 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7344929 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7344930 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7344931 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7344932 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7344933 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7344934 this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit pissed off
7344935 when that dreadful day comes the audience will be ready for it
7344936 the reason the finale of the last series worked so well is that it was top secret
7344937 it s a free country and people are entitled to say this is richard and judy going off into the dim antechamber of television but i would ask them whats the future digital or analogue of course we are going to get smaller audiences but this is the challenge of the moment
7344938 most people are desperate to be famous and would do anything
7344939 it appeals to the mentality of people who stop to watch after an accident
7344940 the wonderful thing about the olympics is seeing people become famous because they have talent what a lovely change
7344941 it is more fulfilling of course because it concerns talent the beatles didnt make it because of me but because of the songs they wrote
7344942 we have had a lot of complaints about the gassing of chicks from the germans this has gone all round the world and the one country that had a problem with it
7344943 i wanted to stand up and say hey after 65 years why do you need to bring that up it was a very unwise thing to say i was shocked
7344944 we work very closely with german tv and the german book publisher and we love all germans
7344945 i was driven to tell a certain kind of story about global consciousness and interconnectivity i asked can people with these powers find each other defeat evil and save the world it was important to have people in the show that werent just blonde haired blue eyed californians
7344946 our relationship with our audience is tenuous but they are passionate intense involved and yes obsessive
7344947 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7344948 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
7344949 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
7344950 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7344951 afhankelijk van de startsituatie kan het kostenniveau in nederlandse ziekenhuizen waarschijnlijk met 20 40 worden verlaagd en kan de zorgkwaliteit met 10 40 toenemen bij een goede aanpak is het tegelijkertijd mogelijk c q noodzakelijk de motivatie en passie van de medewerkers te vergroten en de belangen van pati nten medisch en verplegend personeel en directie beter op elkaar af te stemmen

7344953 anyone who fasts during this month with purity of belief and with expectation of a good reward from his creator will have his previous sins forgiven
7344954 anyone who stands in prayers during its nights with purity of belief and expectation of a reward will have his previous sins forgiven
7344955 there are those who get nothing from their fast but hunger and thirst there are those who get nothing from their nightly prayers but loss of sleep
7344956 youve got to love how its somehow all on me all the petty things and all the pretty things say whatever you want because i can laugh it off

7345100 creo que sa es una idea creada por los medios de comunicaci n
7345101 los recuerdos simplemente est n en el pasado ocurri hace mucho tiempo y han desaparecido prefiero pensar en lo bueno
7345102 era una mujer llena de complejos no me quer a ten a millones de fans pero no me quer a no me sent a bonita porque la persona que yo amaba me dec a que era fea
7345103 well holy shit if this is a terrorist attack we need to get something in the air
7345104 people just launched into action there was a buzz in the unit
7345105 one of the most modern bases in the air force
7345106 is not part of the norad north american aerospace defense command air sovereignty force and did not have an alert mission
7345107 capable and ready response forces for the district of columbia in the event of a natural disaster or civil emergency
7345108 air defense around washington dc is provided mainly by fighter planes from andrews air force base
7345109 we practice scrambles i e taking off as fast as possible to inspect enemy aircraft we know how to do intercepts and other things
7345110 still contain ed all the nellis data from the red flag training exercise they just returned from
7345111 do you have any additional information are you guys going to need some help
7345112 at that time we werent thinking about defending anything our primary concern was what would happen to the air traffic system
7345113 can you guys do anything can you get some fighters in the air as soon as possible
7345114 then the secret service agent told us to stand by and that somebody else would call
7345115 as dcang is a general purpose f 16 unit no one was specifically tasked with keeping the squadron informed
7345116 first inkling that the attacks would go beyond new york was when one of his officers whose husband worked at the pentagon saw on television that the building had been hit and began shrieking
7345117 raced out of his office and ran several hundred yards to the headquarters of the dc guards 121st fighter squadron
7345118 we have to get instructions we cant just fly off half cocked
7345119 i would feel more comfortable receiving such an order from someone higher in the chain of command preferably in the military
7345120 we want you to put a cap up over the city we need some fighters now
7345121 not very comfortable taking orders from a secret service agent thats just not how things are done
7345122 is there anybody else there from the military available to talk
7345123 okay then what exactly do they want me to do
7345124 to send up the aircraft with orders to protect the white house and take out any aircraft that threatened the capitol
7345125 without afterburner to conserve fuel go across the white house over the georgetown area and continue northwest up the potomac
7345126 within minutes of american airlines flight 77 hitting the pentagon
7345127 naval air operations support for the naval district of washington
7345128 focus of training for terrorist attacks has been chemical biological warfare
7345129 i see no evidence of a russian incursion into georgia none whatsover

7345147 ich ordne das spiel als punktverlust ein und nicht als punktgewinn wir haben zu klare torchancen in der zweiten halbzeit gehabt als dass ich jetzt mit dem unentschieden zufrieden sein k nnte
7345148 wir h tten aggressiver verteidigen m ssen da waren wir zu harmlos vfl bochum war viel st rker in den zweik mpfen und hat deswegen in der ersten halbzeit berlegen gespielt
7345149 es war sehr sch n gerade weil ich in der vorbereitung die spiele nicht mitmachen durfte ich hab mich riesig gefreut hier im ruhrstadion vor den fans zu spielen leider war es ungl cklich dass wir das 2 0 abgegeben haben und trotzdem noch 2 2 gespielt haben das war schade denn eigentlich wollten wir den fans den sieg schenken
7345150 dieses spiel mussten wir ganz klar gewinnen wir haben 1 0 ber lange zeit gespielt und es kann nicht sein dass wir noch das 1 1 bekommen das ist eine katastrophe
7345151 wenn ich mich richtig erinnere haben die frankfurter eine hervorragende torsituation herausgespielt die haben sie hervorragend erzielt
7345152 wir sind auf einem ganz guten weg ich bin zuversichtlich und die mannschaft hat auch ber weite strecken berzeugt
7345153 wenn man so ein spiel abliefert und dann noch einen punkt holt dann d rfen wir schon zufrieden sein dar ber hinaus gibt es nicht wenige h hepunkte in dem spiel mit denen wir zufrieden sein k nnen

7345174 its fantastic for chelsea for us as a group because we now have more confidence it was more difficult than portsmouth wigan played better than portsmouth this is the first time i have been to the north of england so now i know what to expect in english football no game is easy
7345175 its not important whether lampard or deco scores the brazilian said
7345176 this is my philosophy chelsea is more important than us as individuals
7345177 as he ran up to the ball he saw the keeper made a mistake move a metre which left room for deco so he went for the other side from what he has been taking in training thats why he is one of the best in the world
7345178 it was another bit of magic but he does it in training every day said ashley cole who limped off with a dead leg but will return to training tomorrow according to chelsea until he departed cole experienced a busy afternoon with valencia and mario melchiot constantly running at him
7345179 chelsea get their width from their full backs who like to get forward said the wigan manager who told zaki to drift wide to peg back jose bosingwa while valencia kept ashley cole deep
7345180 if you have three goalkeepers in the world it is cech buffon and another scolari said
7345181 he trains for an hour but then wants to train for two hours
7345182 chelsea had a bad day at the office but a piece of brilliance won it for them he said
7345183 we have missed an opportunity the top two lose only once or twice a season
7345184 when i won the premier league with manchester united in 1993 norwich city were the only team we had to beat added bruce
7345185 that would never happen now smaller teams cannot mount a challenge we used to mock celtic and rangers in scotland but the gap is enormous in england now its been the same top four for some time now
7345186 it will continue because they can go out and buy two or more players

7345255 someone who could be so emotionally effusive and open is not something you would find in a lot of british people
7345256 really flawed and vulgar and stupid and all kinds of things at once i saw it as an opportunity to do something big

7345262 totally malicious and utterly without any foundation whatsoever it was totally invented it annoyed me because it was very difficult for me to defend myself because of course my concern was with owen it wasnt with being preoccupied with something that was slanderous i didnt want to inflame the situation by getting into a tit for tat
7345263 he was as appalled as i was when he read that
7345264 there was a lot of noise in the house a lot of hustle and bustle
7345265 to get any kind of attention you really had to do something
7345266 some very verbose relative or someone maybe the rest of the family wasnt too keen on in school my teacher would have me stand in front of class and mimic other teachers for his own amusement when i was reluctant he would say well then we can open the books and do some work then the rest of the students wanted me to do it because they didnt want to work
7345267 then we did hamlet 1 as i like to refer to it now
7345268 it was a major disappointment for them that they wound up teaching
7345269 the frustration was that the talented people perhaps arent as passionate about theater as the less talented it is the lack of justice in the creative world because talent is something you can perfect you can make better but you cant just bestow it on someone it is sort of a god given thing and he is pretty unjust about who he hands it out to

7345284 thank god because i cant hold you off any longer
7345285 its a miracle lewis made it to qualifying and when he did i was the happiest man in the world
7345286 i had flu when i arrived with hard fevers every day ive been low on energy and i also had quite a big problem with a spasm in my neck which almost led to me not racing this weekend
7345287 i woke up very early yesterday around 5am and i had this spasm but fortunately ive a great doctor who was with me all the way through it
7345288 it was so bad i was even struggling to stand up so i had to have injections in my neck and take plenty of painkillers
7345289 so i think eight points is a good effort i thought i did a pretty decent job considering
7345290 it was probably something to do with my pillow the way i was sleeping because it hurt just when i woke up
7345291 i know a driver who brings a pillow with him from home to every race
7345292 weve scored some good points it was a long hot race i didnt have enough water in the car but im happy to have come through it
7345293 were showing weve great reliability and thats due to all the team doing a fantastic job
7345294 the match was a little bit thrilling it was a lot of ups and downs from both of us but eventually in the third set i got my thoughts back and my rhythm
7345295 this is a really big tournament before the us open and i beat some really great players to win it
7345296 i was injured at the beginning of the year and havent had my best results but this week has helped me regain my confidence in time for the us open
7345297 ill celebrate this win and just look forward to new york
7345298 the sad thing is that a majority of the very top players like roger federer and rafael nadal actually seem to dislike de villiers personally but equally sadly de villiers brought that on himself there is an anger inside him which he does not seem able to control charming one minute he could blow a gasket the next staff below the executive level were afraid of him players who were only trying to put forward alternative opinions were shocked at being yelled at and the leaders of other tennis organizations such as the itf and grand slam chairmen quickly tired of his outbursts
7345299 guys are getting stronger and fitter and guys are playing better tennis
7345300 i dont think its roger getting worse i dont think theres any way thats the case i think guys are definitely improving guys are catching up a little thats not to say he cant turn it on at any time because the talent confidence he has and court sense he could turn it on and go through this tournament just like last year and couple years ago where he just goes through making it look easy but i hope i have something to say i hope some of the other guys have something to say about that and were going to do our best

7345304 we like to involve ourselves in companies that mean things not only that has a lot to do with family because me and my sister we are really close with family and things that have to do with charities off court as well

7345353 venue has had a tremendous impact on the way we work
7345354 its streamlined my workflow greatly reduced our setup time and dramatically lessened the amount of equipment we carry more to the point its improved our sound quality
7345355 with the dramatic improvements in the quality of recorded music over the past 20 years fans have become far more sophisticated and their listening expectations are considerably higher
7345356 in addition internet based technologies such as itunes have created a level of consumer immediacy and a desire on behalf of artists and management to capture high quality live recordings for fast delivery to their eager fans the venue systems ability to combine live sound mixing with industry standard recording and production tools such as pro tools recording software is enabling engineers and musicians to meet the increasingly sophisticated demands of their listeners
7345357 its only through great advances in audio technology like pro tools that its now possible to achieve in real time a level of sound quality worthy of a live webcast like this one digidesign has enabled todays artists and productions to bring studio quality sound to live performance and to the internet

7345366 i think it is fair to say the crisis is deepening because people are very worried about the health of some financial institutions will more fail the fact is if you mark to market some of the illiquid assets the banks hold at prices they could sell them in todays climate it could make many of them insolvent
7345367 the topic du jour is fannie and freddie clearly the market is looking for a solution that is permanent clear and definitive that dwarfs everything

7345822 prevailing in this struggle will require far more than military force it will require the use of all elements of our national power public diplomacy development assistance law enforcement training expansion of economic opportunity and robust intelligence capabilities i have called for major changes in how our government faces the challenge of radical islamic extremism by much greater resources for and integration of civilian efforts to prevent conflict and to address post conflict challenges our goal must be to win the hearts and minds of the vast majority of moderate muslims who do not want their future controlled by a minority of violent extremists in this struggle scholarships will be far more important than smart bombs
7345823 the resignation of president musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing pakistan is a critical theatre in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation with the us

7345844 i see barack obama as the apex of the lyndon johnson legacy
7345845 but you cant talk about iraq without talking about vietnam
7345846 you cant leave that out his presidency did not end in triumph
7345847 every generation pays very close attention to the major controversies of the time and when johnson left office in 1969 vietnam was still raging and a lot of americans were furious at johnson
7345848 they werent thinking about a lot of things they had liked about him like civil rights and in 1969 people were not as aware as historians are now of the efforts he made to get the country out of the war
7345849 the sense of that seems to be very much lost

7345857 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7345858 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7345859 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7345860 i am a zionist you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
7345861 we cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded

7345992 you have sinned against the lord and be sure your sin will find you out

7346003 in his very first appearance as the vice presidential candidate biden demonstrated that hes more than willing to play the traditional role of attack dog
7346004 he recited a litany of what many democrats feel is wrong with the current administration and linked his friend john mccain to them in doing so biden proved himself an able fighter in his initial outing
7346005 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong

7346015 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7346016 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7346017 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7346018 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7346019 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7346020 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7346021 i cannot see that the members of an international family of churches can thrive and grow and offer a clear witness to jesus christ as lord while offering contradictory teaching on a matter as central as the character of the holy life in different parts of a world knit together by instantaneous e communications
7346022 we will see who wants to be part of this and then we will get a manager that everybody will be happy with
7346023 and i know alex ferguson has been approached by seb coe and i have spoken to him about it
7346024 im not sure they the different national associations would allow it
7346025 countries have their own identity their own patriotism it has been mooted for a number of years by fifa at the world cup that great britain has a team it would be impractical in that sense scotland northern ireland wales even england all have their own identities so i dont think it is a starter
7346026 i hope im still on this planet in 2012 first of all i dont need any commitment to anything like that
7346027 i think the whole of the country will want when the olympic games is held in britain and theres a football tournament where the final is held in britain they will want us to have a team in the competition
7346028 this is an extraordinary blunder by the prime minister particularly leading up to the by election in glenrothes
7346029 what does he think the people of fife would think about putting at risk the future of the scottish football team
7346030 the fact is that gordon brown has become so obsessed with his british campaign he has lost touch with reality
7346031 this is not a popular idea not only do all the national supporters associations oppose this but the majority of football associations in the uk have said they do not want to take part in a single uk team
7346032 a melhor banda de todos os tempos da ltima semana
7346033 the game didnt really go our way in that second half but we hung in there and kelly made a big play to win the game
7346034 morgan got the ball from lauren hair and i thought she was going to shoot it
7346035 but then she pulled it back and played it to me so i touched it around the defender and pulled the trigger i saw their goalkeeper was shading to the right because it was on my right foot so i just aimed for the left and found the side netting
7346036 kelly is an upperclassman now and she has started to feel comfortable taking responsibility and helping the team win games
7346037 i thought friday night against wake forest she did a fantastic job of managing the game in the second half and being our leader today she played about four different positions and was able to move around comfortably in them all at the end of the day good players make good plays when it counts
7346038 it felt really good to help the team and give us something to build off of
7346039 after katy played it in amanda had a shot deflect off of a defender and rebound straight to me and i got really excited i saw that no one was at the far post so i just tried to hit it as hard as i could so that if it didnt go in we might still have another chance at it
7346040 we made some really nice plays around the box im not sure we necessarily solved what they presented to us but to be able to hang in there under those circumstances was definitely a positive individually morgan skeen was very good in the second half and lauren porter did a nice job as well we just kept hanging in there
7346041 we are always happy to win one on the road i dont think we won more than one game outside the state of utah last year
7346042 it was nice to once again find out more about ourselves i think we are still just trying to find the positions formation and strategy to help us use all of the qualities we have we took some steps this weekend and found out what some of these players can do and now we can go back and train on that lauren dudley got her first action in the second half and was solid along with mallory mitamura danielle sample and addie hair getting our players in and seeing what they can do is big deal
7346043 it was a hard back and forth game i think we had the majority of the first half possession but in the second half they did a lot of moving and running winning 50 50 balls and it was hard for us to transition when playing so much defense but we stuck in there and gave it everything we had we played awesome defense we were strong in our tackles and some players stepped up we had some players get hurt and a few others stepped in and played really well sometimes a game like this rolls your way like today and other times it doesnt like friday night
7346044 it feels nice last year i didnt have the greatest scoring season but i had a lot of assists and i will never take those for granted goals and assists go hand in hand but i appreciate morgan playing the ball to me instead of hitting it thats probably what i would have done last year to have two goals in two games kind of takes the pressure off a little bit
7346045 is it hot enough for you i cant wait for cooler weather myself oh do you have more carrots for me no not an apple i dont like them im not a big peppermint fan either thanks for coming nice to see you come again sometime

7346051 this is the situation in which the interventionists have placed our country committed to go to war for countries and causes that do not justify war against a russia that is re emerging as a great power only to find nato squatting on her doorstep
7346052 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7346053 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7346054 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
7346055 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
7346056 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

7346060 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
7346061 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
7346062 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
7346063 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
7346064 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
7346065 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
7346066 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
7346067 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
7346068 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
7346069 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
7346070 they call flour and sugar long life foods foods that are filling them up and keeping them going when youve got only a bit of money to spend on food and you dont want your children to go hungry you dont worry so much about the quality
7346071 you cant fool all of the people all the time
7346072 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7346073 we realize that mistakes have been made but were excited in florida
7346074 we had the guts to take the system on and we made progress this year
7346075 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic

7346078 pentru ca suntem constienti de importanta procesului de fidelizare a an gajatilor valorosi am incercat sa ne pliem nu doar pe nevoile profesionale ale angajatilor nostri ci am dorit sa luam in calcul si latura umana a acestora
7346079 ideea de a organiza o croaziera ne a venit din dorinta de a sparge putin tiparul aniversarilor traditionale de a l inova si de a ne surprinde in mod placut angajatii ne vom imbarca din atena in portul piraeus si vom poposi pe insulele mykonos patmos creta santorini si kusadasi din turcia
7346080 este foarte greu sa vorbim de planificarea resurselor umane de anticiparea numarului de joburi de care vom avea nevoie in viitor fara o permanenta ancorare la planurile de dezvoltare ale companiei dar si o adaptare permanenta la specificul pietei
7346081 o mare parte dintre angajatii nostri care sunt pasionati de un anume limbaj de programare sau care pur si simplu vor sa fie permanent la curent cu inovatiile din domeniu pot participa la aceste cursuri
7346082 in acest domeniu oamenii sunt intr o continua competitie cu ei insisi pentru ca trebuie sa fie mereu informati si pregatiti pentru provocarile tehnologice iar noi incercam prin toate caile posibile sa le facilitam accesul la aceste informatii
7346083 odata cu evolutia pietei potentialii nostri angajati au crescut standardele asteptarilor lor si si au rafinat mult optiunile un manager de hr trebuie sa fie si el mereu pe front sa simta tendintele pietei si sa vina permanent in intampinarea lor
7346084 this year continues to be a good year compared with what was going on two or three years ago and by the end of the year we could see the same volume of transactions as in 2007
7346085 creste numarul firmelor care au o nevoie din ce in mai mare de forta de munca de vanzari deci avanseaza si numarul cursurilor de vanzari probabil ca numarul trainingurilor pe vanzari va creste cu 20 30 fata de 2007
7346086 in industria bancara de exemplu toata lumea vinde bani totusi unele banci vand mai mult decat altele sunt patru surse care pot genera avantaj competitiv in fata clientilor produsul sau serviciul in sine superioritatea economica prezenta pe piata respectiv superioritatea relatiei tradusa in abilitati de vanzare
7346087 in functie de gradul de implicare atat al vanzatorului cat si al cumparatorului exista trei tipuri mari de vanzari tranzactionale consultative si strategice abordarea este complet diferita in fiecare dintre aceste cazuri nu poti vinde suc in felul in care vinzi constructia unei autostrazi nici viceversa ar fi total ineficient
7346088 un area sales manager de exemplu trebuie sa fie in stare sa faca interventii de coaching in cadrul echipei
7346089 un curs de introducere in vanzari costa circa 2 200 2 800 de euro dar se poate ajunge si la tarife de 3 600 4 000 de euro pentru un curs de vanzari avansat
7346090 poate dura insa si mai multe luni cu mai multe faze de implementare in cazul in care trainingurile sunt combinate cu interventii de coaching pe teren in vederea observarii modului in care ceea ce se invata este pus in practica
7346091 nu exista o recomandare standard a programelor pe care un vanzator ar trebui sa le parcurga pentru a ocupa o functie manageriala
7346092 the development of consumer spending in romania has led to very high salary levels for marketing managers in the fmcg business salary levels that take into account the complexity of positions competition on the market and the trend of the turnover of the companies in the consumer goods industry
7346093 the key top management positions vary according to the industry whereas marketing and sales positions are essential to fmcg the most important positions in the financial banking industry are those of chief operating officers and chief financial officers
7346094 salary gaps at the top management level are very wide and they narrow down the ladder
7346095 in prima parte a programului participantii vor dobandi patru sase luni de experienta practica pe parcursul unui circuit al departamentelor de specialitate a doua parte a programului este destinata specializarii in cadrul unui anumit departament
7346096 declinul euro in fata monedei americane si speculatiile potrivit carora perspectivele de crestere economica a zonei euro se vor inrautati au determinat aceasta cursa in jos a zlotului
7346097 a determinat investitorii sa si transforme in lichiditati profiturile obtinute anterior pe aceste piete
7346098 exista semne care sa indice faptul ca vanzarile de pe pietele tarilor emergente vor continua sa creasca insa intr un ritm mai incet
7346099 pietele emergente au compensat vanzarile scazute de pe pietele mature anul trecut scenariu inca valabil si astazi

7346105 investors get confused by the volatility of the market they would have to learn that volatility is a part of equity and the market always compensates in terms of a higher return because of the volatility
7346106 volatility is a friend of long term investors and an enemy of speculators
7346107 in fact volatility should be used by long term investors to their benefit by way of buying good stocks whenever the market falls heavily

7346121 am fost surprins ca toata lumea se focusa pe real estate si ignora sectoarele productive care au perspective pe termen lung si care vor sustine cresterea economica orientandu se pe real estate investitorii pierdeau foarte multe oportunitati acum se pare ca multi dintre oamenii care au facut bani din real estate ii redirectioneaza catre alte domenii
7346122 primele semne ale incetinirii din real estate au aparut anul trecut in polonia apoi acestea s au transferat in romania in 2008 pe masura globalizarii aceste fenomene sunt precum un val mai devreme sau mai tarziu vor ajunge si vor avea impact in toate economiile
7346123 incetinerea sectorului imobiliar a fost vizibila inca din a doua jumatate a anului trecut randamentele au scazut atat de mult incat nu mai era interesat sa investesti in aceasta tara
7346124 companiile romanesti nu au inca dimensiunea necesara pentru a putea sa vedem o consolidare intranationala vedem inca multe preluari ale strainilor
7346125 acum este momentul pentru investitori agili sa investeasca piata va fi mai provocatoare si va fi mai dificil de facut bani dar pentru noi este infinit mai interesanta acum decat in era real estate a adaugat ioannides
7346126 vedem si acolo aceleasi simptome un numar mare de tranzactii dar de valoare mica pentru ca vedem destul de multe tranzactii in alte sectoare sunt optimist rezervat pentru acest an cred ca vor fi multe provocari dar asta nu inseamna ca va fi mai putina activitate comparativ cu anul trecut
7346127 din ce in ce mai multi antreprenori romani care au cumparat o afacere sau au achizitionat o prin privatizare au ajuns la un anumit nivel al businessului in care realizeaza ca nu se mai pot dezvolta pe baza resurselor proprii ei sunt in principal oamenii care vand afaceri in romania acum trei patru ani nu primeam practic niciun mandat pe partea de sell de la oameni de afaceri romani acum balanta s a echilibrat

7346135 we pretty much went over every single situation that could ever happen in a football game
7346136 it was a good learning experience just to get us ready for anything that might happen during the season probably half of the stuff that happened in the mock game we might not even see in the season or until later on in the season it was a good mental exercise in keeping everyone focused
7346137 were so much smarter everyone knows what theyre doing and weve got some more wrinkles that were going to throw into the offense that will help us get in and out of good plays
7346138 last year we may have thought i hope everybody knows this or i hope everybody runs this right and this year its not even a thought
7346139 one of the things that he does when we meet and go over game plans and watch film is to just make sure that were on the same page and that were thinking the same way
7346140 if were thinking two different things we wont mesh well together he does a great job of getting me prepared for the games everything hes thinking im thinking the same thing we try to be in each others head as much as possible
7346141 he has the most energy out of any coach that ive ever been around
7346142 he never stops hes always on the move and hes always brewing something up hes the mad scientist up there in his lab hes always got something new something that hes thinking about anything to make this team better
7346143 one day i think greg little was down and ryan houston was down and shaun had to go with the ones for the day
7346144 he was only like four or five days into playing running back didnt really know much but he stepped it up big and took his chance and just exploited it because he did good that day and hes impressed the coaches and impressed everybody on this team by how hard and how fast he runs
7346145 theyre both big huge targets that are good in the jump ball situations
7346146 theyre big strong guys that can fight off a little db both of them have done a great job contributing all training camp and theyre both physical specimens theyve got all the tools so i think either one of them can step in and do just as well as hakeem

7346160 the government has appreciated the move however we expect the ministry to demonstrate necessary patience required and show faith in private players it is not possible to find instant solutions to problems related to content we have put in place the necessary set up it will take some time to deliver
7346161 we will lay down guidelines on media coverage we are not concerned about media criticising us
7346162 we are for media freedom what we are saying is there is no absolute freedom
7346163 is curfew a solution to the problem i think no the centre should rather start looking for ways and means to bring the separatist leaders to the discussion table rather than having the ostrich like attitude that everything will be fine once the storm is over

7346177 don quixote is insane but i think cervantes did that only to make him very human here is a person at his most human level even unable to reason unable to understand the most basic happenings around him in the midst of that he helps people the underlying message seems to be that ultimately all our sophistication and panache isnt what makes a difference in the world it is the greater spirit within us it works through our disabilities and weaknesses he hears a boy a slave for example being beaten in the forest and goes to help him most people would have seen a slave being beaten and stayed out of it but believing himself a knight don quixote goes to help the boy in all his fumblings and misunderstandings he becomes a hero human ability isnt as necessary as we think it is we strive to be perfect and here is a man who is far from it and still helps others i think thats what cervantes is getting at our intentions outweigh our gifts or abilities

7346217 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7346218 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche

7346221 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7346224 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta

7346226 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7346227 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7346228 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7346229 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7346230 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7346231 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7346232 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7346233 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7346234 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7346235 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7346236 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7346237 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7346238 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales

7346241 i a mai dat cate o palma din cand in cand
7346242 doar cand eram beata il mai loveam o data l am ars cu tigara cateodata mai urinam pe el
7346243 ea a retractat apoi totul pretinzand ca nu stie ce i s a intamplat micutului iar in fata judecatorului a recunoscut doar ca ii mai dadea din cand in cand cate o palma
7346244 era suficient de calma nu parea sa aiba remuscari am intrebat o de ce a facut ce a facut si a tacut a lasat capul in jos

7346246 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7346247 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7346248 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7346249 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7346250 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7346251 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7346252 this is not about debating policy this has moved on to another sphere this is hate

7346258 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7346259 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7346260 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7346261 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7346262 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7346263 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7346264 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7346265 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s

7346267 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo

7346276 how far school administrators can extend their sphere of influence before running afoul of constitutional law
7346277 students like all citizens have strong first amendment protection when it comes to expressing themselves off campus
7346278 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7346279 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7346280 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7346281 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7346282 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7346283 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7346284 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7346285 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7346286 who had lost loved ones or who had individuals serving
7346287 martin garbus a first amendment lawyer who has been working pro bono with ms dickinson the theater teacher and several parents of cast members said yesterday that schools are allowed to regulate speech that has the potential to disrupt learning
7346288 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7346289 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7346290 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7346291 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

7346322 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7346323 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7346324 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7346325 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7346326 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7346327 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

7346331 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7346332 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7346333 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7346334 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7346335 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7346336 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7346337 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7346338 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7346339 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7346340 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7346341 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7346342 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7346343 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7346344 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7346345 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7346346 were still looking for that one major break that one big lead
7346347 the more time that goes by the more concern there is with his safety
7346348 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7346349 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7346350 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7346351 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7346352 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7346353 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7346354 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7346355 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7346356 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7346357 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7346358 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7346359 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7346360 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7346361 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7346362 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7346363 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7346364 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7346365 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7346366 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7346367 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7346368 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7346369 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7346370 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7346371 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7346372 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7346373 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7346374 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7346375 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7346376 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7346377 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7346378 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7346379 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7346380 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7346381 i dont see what all the fuss is over some dumb nigger
7346382 im not racist or anything i just dont think there should be a black guy president i just dont think its right thats all
7346383 estamos seguros de que este centro no va a quedar desocupado no va a entrar en la l nea de los que no tiene trabajo sino que cada d a la situaci n concreta que vivimos muestra un derrotero donde el frabya se ha ganado un lugar y lo tendr m s claramente hacia el futuro

7346390 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7346391 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7346392 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7346393 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7346394 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7346395 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7346396 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7346397 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7346398 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7346399 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7346400 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7346401 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7346402 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7346403 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7346404 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7346405 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7346406 well i dont know how many pairs of shoes i own

7346409 mr campbell often admonished his students at ridgeview high school
7346410 and mickey gets cuter because walt disney makes more money that way
7346411 evolution has been the focus of a lot of debate in our state this year
7346412 if you read the newspapers everyone is arguing is it a theory is it not a theory the answer is we can observe it we can see it happen just like you can see it in mickey
7346413 i can see that theres no way i came from an ape
7346414 is this really what they want us to teach for the next 10 years
7346415 i dont think we have this great massive change over time where we go from fish to amphibians from monkeys to man
7346416 we see lizards with different shaped tails we dont see blizzards the lizard bird
7346417 we also failed to include astrology alchemy and the concept of the moon being made of green cheese
7346418 i can do this until the end of the semester and i can only assume that it will work the same way each time
7346419 bryce what is it called when natural laws are suspended what do you call it when water changes into wine
7346420 it cant tell you whats right and wrong it doesnt address ethics but it is not anti religion science and religion just ask different questions
7346421 cant test it cant prove it cant disprove it its not a question for science
7346422 but there is scientific proof that there is a god
7346423 over in turkey theres a piece of wood from noahs ark that came out of a glacier
7346424 if i could prove tomorrow that that chunk of wood is not from the ark is not even 500 years old and not even from the right kind of tree would that damage your religious faith at all
7346425 and science is not based on faith i dont expect you to believe the scientific explanation of evolution that were going to talk about over the next few weeks
7346426 i still dont have a good feeling on how well any of them are internalizing any of this
7346427 its maybe the size of a dogs jaw or a cats
7346428 i think a big reason evolutionists believe what they believe is they dont want to have to be ruled by god
7346429 thats why people stand strong with christianity because it teaches people to lead a good life and not do wrong
7346430 ill watch the discovery channel and say ooh thats interesting
7346431 but theres a difference between thinking something is interesting and believing it
7346432 homo sapiens appeared in africa 200 000 years ago based on fossil and dna evidence
7346433 the fossil evidence of hominids alleged human ancestors is extremely limited
7346434 but theirs is a longer hand because they live in trees and their arms are very long
7346435 but this is happening over millions of years with humans if im lucky i might see four generations in my lifetime
7346436 then whatever we evolved from where did it evolve from
7346437 how does our hand go from being that long to just a smaller hand
7346438 individuals with small hands will have more children while those with bigger hands will disappear
7346439 but if we came from them why are they still around
7346440 just because a new population evolves doesnt mean the old one dies out
7346441 if the environment is suitable a species can go on for a long time

7346452 is there anything special ill have to do to take care of this ring
7346453 one of the best ways to protect a wedding ring is to soak it in dishwater
7346454 i take some coffee in my mouth right outside the coffee room and spit it back in when i get outside your office
7346455 excuse me can you help me i promised my friend i would meet him half an hour ago but i dont know where i am
7346456 yes you are in a hot air balloon hovering approximately 30 feet above this field you are between 40 and 42 degrees n latitude and between 58 and 60 degrees w longitude
7346457 everything you have told me is technically correct but i have no idea what to make of your information and the fact is i am still lost
7346458 you dont know where you are or where you are going you have made a promise which you have no idea how to keep and you expect me to solve your problem the fact is you are in the exact same position you were in before we met but now it is somehow my fault
7346459 i thought you were after the five hundred dollars ive got in my shoe

7346462 a lot of people going into independent films and financing them dont really have a good sense of the market theyre going after or how to take advantage of new ways to distribute
7346463 we have what i consider an aggressive and exciting business plan behind each one of the movies were producing and it doesnt depend on the fact that we have to go to film festivals and rely on companies like miramax picking us up it doesnt have to succeed at the level of the dark knight to make a healthy profit
7346464 the first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building
7346465 the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event

7346477 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7346478 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7346479 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7346480 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7346481 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7346482 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7346483 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7346484 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7346485 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7346486 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps

7346495 a church can only claim to be the one church of christ if it holds no more and no less than the faith defined by the church through councils which were judged to be councils of the whole church the members of the one church of christ must be in sacramental communion with each other although that communion may be broken from time to time as it is by non dogmatic considerations
7346496 they that are of the church of christ are they that are of the truth and they that are not of the truth are not of the church of christ for we are reminded that
7346497 in all this controversy one should also note the lack of correspondence between spiritual content and canonical forms authentic church life may be present yet still ignored or mislabeled conversely authentic spiritual life may be absent yet canonical recognition be extended in fact we are ignoring the real source of the canonical reality in favor of empty names claims and titles should we not instead discuss real issues however painful this may be do we care enough love enough to take upon ourselves this cross of truth
7346498 there is no such thing of course as canonical orthodox jurisdiction

7346505 freedom of the press is limited to those who own one
7346506 better to write for yourself and have no public than to write for the public and have no self
7346507 the most important political office is that of the private citizen
7346508 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed its the only thing that ever has
7346509 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american public
7346510 i sometimes feel that alfred e neuman is in charge in washington
7346511 when i was a boy i was told that anybody could become president im beginning to believe it
7346512 i know im known for speaking my mind hopefully clearly strongly but
7346513 i know im known for speaking my mind hopefully clearly strongly but
7346514 the flag should never be displayed with the union down except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property
7346515 i like guys whove never been there that criticize us whove been there i like that i like guys who got five deferments and never been there and send people to war and then dont like to hear suggestions about what needs to be done
7346516 many of those who want to rush this country into war and think it would be so quick and easy dont know anything about war they come at it from an intellectual perspective versus having sat in jungles or foxholes and watched their friends get their heads blown off
7346517 there will be a lot of detractors people saying we arent patriots id like to know what theyve given up there is no way our children died in vain not if we pay attention not if we learn im proud of my son i love the marines and im very much against this war and always have been i guess our children went and were sacrificed for us to take a look at what we let happen we let this war happen if nothing else this is a huge lesson watch who you vote for watch what theyre telling you dont be so afraid
7346518 fool me once shame on shame on you fool me you cant get fooled again
7346519 this is not about who they are this is about who we are we are americans and we hold ourselves to a higher standard of conduct and no the end does not justify the means not now not ever when the means include torturing prisoners

7346524 to envision that you can divide iraq into three parts is to envision ethnic cleansing on a massive scale sectarian killing on a massive scale and uprooting of families
7346525 many middle east experts are horrified by the difficulty of dividing the nation
7346526 when he sees that you commit yourself to a certain timetable he will use this to increase pressure and attacks to make it look as though he is forcing you out we have many actors who would love to take advantage of that opportunity

7346550 were more aware of it in the uk because of the ashes the world twenty20 and the one day series against australia but it is no busier a year than any other
7346551 there will certainly be more security assessments were going to meet around the table in 3 or 4 weeks in dubai to discuss the mechanisms of the postponement there are numerous things to be discussed and were planning on meeting in the middle of september to discuss the consequences of the decision
7346552 every one of our members wishes to ensure the icc champions trophy is a world class event and the prospect of relocating it at short notice in order to make sure it was played this year would not allow that criterion to be fulfilled
7346553 cricket is not going to die here its just that we are going through a difficult phase
7346554 we would have lost the hosting rights had the champions trophy been relocated to sri lanka
7346555 with four of the eight teams threatening to pull out

7346560 morne bowled the equivalent of six overs in the nets in two spells of four overs and two overs
7346561 he was only operating at about 50 percent of his capacity so we will have to step him up quite a bit on monday if he is to make tuesdays second match
7346562 albie has also made significant progress he took a complete part in the batting and fielding drills but at this stage is only bowling with a tennis ball under the direction of shane jabaar the team physiotherapist again monday will be an important session for him
7346563 the ecb supports the decision of the icc to postpone the champions trophy until october 2009
7346564 the ecb made it clear to icc chief executive haroon lorgat at a meeting at lords last week that ecb had a duty of care for england players and officials as well as a desire to ensure the interests of the media and spectators were not compromised

7346569 i have a lot to learn so im very realistic about it all
7346570 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7346571 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7346572 and through trial and error i finally settled on type of spit for the task at hand
7346573 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7346574 for the first time as i dived to gather the ball at square leg i landed on my side and a shower of murray mints spewed out of my trouser pocket all over the grass right in front of the umpire
7346575 fortunately neither he nor the two batsmen seemed to take much notice as i scrambled around on all fours trying desperately to gather in the sweets before they started asking awkward questions

7346580 from our point of view we just play and when he gets the goals he gets the goals if he happens to get on the end of them great but we are more interested in hawthorn kicking the goals necessarily than just one player
7346581 thats not ideal but we play in a very volatile and aggressive sport and we ask our players to play tough hard footy and sometimes that drags them a little bit closer to the line so theyre vulnerable to reports and suspensions
7346582 everyones seen what hes done and young players have had the chance to get to know him and watch his work ethic
7346583 the u s military meanwhile announced the arrest of an al qaida in iraq figure who allegedly planned the 2006 kidnapping of american journalist jill carroll one of the highest profile attacks against westerners in iraq

7346589 was a more or less routine act of manslaughter if such a thing is said to exist
7346590 the harm to the motoring public is inherent to this offense randomly and intentionally shooting at cars with a rifle from a highway overpass creates a public fear beyond that of the ordinary manslaughter in which the victim is at least associated with creating the sudden heat that results in the death

7346602 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7346603 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7346604 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7346605 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7346606 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7346607 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7346608 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7346609 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7346610 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7346611 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7346612 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7346613 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

7346615 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7346616 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7346617 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7346618 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7346619 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7346620 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7346621 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7346622 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7346623 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7346624 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7346625 this is a planning took where all things are going

7346634 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7346635 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7346636 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7346637 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7346638 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7346639 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7346640 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7346641 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7346642 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7346643 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7346644 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7346645 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7346646 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7346647 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7346648 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7346649 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7346650 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7346651 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7346652 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7346653 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7346654 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7346655 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7346656 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7346657 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7346658 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7346659 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7346660 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7346661 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7346662 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7346663 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7346664 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7346665 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7346666 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7346667 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7346668 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7346669 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7346670 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7346671 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7346672 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7346673 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7346674 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7346675 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7346676 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7346677 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7346678 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7346679 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7346680 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7346681 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7346682 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7346683 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7346684 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7346685 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7346686 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7346687 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7346688 im sorry i misjudged the situation im glad america is winning in iraq now
7346689 im usually pretty good at doing impersonations because ive done a lot sketch comedy
7346690 but for some reason i just wasnt mastering natalie portmans voice
7346691 but what was so neat was that they said wed like you to audition for another role a new role thats all i knew they didnt give out any details
7346692 usually at auditions i stay pretty composed if i mess up or if im struggling i try not to show it for some reason at that audition i was so frustrated that i couldnt give the accent that they wanted i really started to show a lot of emotion in trying to get into the script i moved around a lot and moved my arms you know just really got into it
7346693 playing somewhere for the first time is always fun obviously our fans are excited about being in the stadium and were just as excited about playing is a home game our new home im sure it will be fun
7346694 it will be fun even though its just a preseason game i think our guys going in there tuesday with no crowd at all were excited and had a very good practice just because of the atmosphere so i think its going to be great
7346695 i think opening up new places is always fun its not very often you get to do it but especially for our veteran guys seeing the difference between the rca dome and lucas oil just feeling that pride and that environment its a difference and it will be good for us
7346696 one thing you learn moving stadiums is the stadium doesnt win for you or the amenities or the crowd
7346697 it will be fun it will be awesome to open up the stadium just to have the fans geared up but its important for us to be out there for the preseason games just so were not lost or we can find the locker room and kind of get comfortable with our surroundings
7346698 thats what will be beneficial for this preseason game not only getting better on the field but getting used to the new routine that well have
7346699 were taking the time to break things down and see what tendencies they have what they like do to on offense and defense plus our ones should be out there a little bit longer
7346700 i think it will be a good gauge heading into the season
7346701 if theres been one thing disappointing about our offense in general it has been our red zone production
7346702 were zeroing in we took a lot more plays in the red zone this week just to put a little more emphasis on it overall it hasnt been bad weve move the ball well and thats what wed like to get some consistency
7346703 the club have confirmed that defender micah richards has been released from hospital tonight after being stretchered off during citys 3 0 victory over west ham united earlier today
7346704 when you do shop at the grocery store its very limited they dont have a very wide selection
7346705 i think if we had a farmers market i think we would shop more and eat more produce
7346706 were already outpacing 2007 so i think were going to see significant growth
7346707 it helps the local farmer it helps the families both stretch their food dollars and makes sure they are getting access to fruits and vegetables
7346708 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7346709 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7346710 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7346711 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7346712 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7346713 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7346714 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7346715 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7346716 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 percent for him
7346717 our normal model for recruitment has been that we help them set up their practice
7346718 we give an income guarantee in the first year of practice and then they go into the normal private practice model and they are on their own
7346719 there is just no more room because they are so busy
7346720 when you came in someone was just calling me looking for a specialist and so i gave her the name of everybody i knew of in spokane she had called eight of the ten and had not been able to get in even as close as spokane
7346721 we met with one person who moved into the area and was upset because he couldnt find a physician after he moved here
7346722 he felt the realtor should have told him before he came because he looked at this and other places
7346723 we have a lot of patients that are applying to be patients here and its just an overwhelming response
7346724 it helps for the emergency but it isnt the best way to provide medical care
7346725 they are willing to give the chazz clinic the first year of rent free in the office as part of wanting to bring more doctors to the valley
7346726 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7346727 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7346728 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7346729 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7346730 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7346731 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7346732 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7346733 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7346734 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 percent for him
7346735 curt ellis as i was breaking down the equipment and packing it all away i said more or less to out loud to myself i ought to do a story on pasture fed cows curt was right there responding you should i nodded my head thinking okay ill look into it
7346736 we didnt even think wed get enough volunteers to cover all the shifts
7346737 people need to work together were stronger and we get more done collectively
7346738 the one with the yellow and blue spinnaker is rq 208 finished

7346745 have you been through in the dark before i asked
7346746 if you can get through at six you can get through at sixty
7346747 thats it mate he said reckon we should press on for another hour and to save time in the morning
7346748 i thought you said we were only going for another hour not the rest of the night
7346749 ya que estamos aqu nos llevamos un par de cosas
7346750 s claro que te quiero pero no me dejes los cacetines en el suelo anda cari
7346751 thank god you guys came im stuck in the shower stall
7346752 yes of course i see the knob mom ive been trying to turn it for nearly a half hour
7346753 turn the handle down while simultaneously pulling back on it
7346754 you must go on without me im just going to die anyway
7346755 hold on tara moms going to try and find someone with a key
7346756 do you have a key that we could borrow for the bathroom
7346757 i am sorry madam you need a key to get into the bathrooms
7346758 yes i know we have a key but its with my daughter who is locked inside the bathroom
7346759 your daughter is in the bathroom but your daughter is there
7346760 no its my other daughter she is locked inside the shower stall do you have a key
7346761 is there a guard here or someone that has a key to the bathrooms
7346762 my moko is the moko of a woman proud to be a
7346763 the revival of moko for many of us is really exercising our rangatiratanga our fundamental right to exist
7346764 the bottom of the design represents my mountains the sides my whakapapa the curls at my lip my children and the top spirals each side of my family
7346765 originally i put the moko on as part of the gang experience then it changed with my life now ive got no choice but to speak the body language
7346766 a healthy context for my body no drink no smoke no drugs
7346767 banks and credit card companies to tilt the playing field in their favor at the expense of hardworking americans
7346768 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7346769 you cannot go into a 7 11 or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent oh im not joking
7346770 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7346771 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7346772 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7346773 i am a zionist you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
7346774 we cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
7346775 the truth of the matter is it is going to become a subject if in fact theres a 40 per cent shortfall in recruitment its just a reality
7346776 not only to change the direction of america but literally literally to change the direction of the world
7346777 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night before you put the kids after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at

7347107 this guy has taken a beating over the span of his career and it drove him over the edge
7347108 right now ive talked to joe silva quite a few times and were looking at maybe january
7347109 i dont know that id say that it annoys me i just think its unprofessional you know here we are were in a sport where you gotta make weight and he doesnt make weight and he misses weight by so much i think four pounds or something so really did he even try and make weight
7347110 if i ever happen to not make weight i will die trying it will never be four pounds over itll be you know matt couldnt make weight because he ran so much he had to go to the hospital
7347111 i gotta be real honest i was kind of bored with this match it was the last fight of the night and halfway in the third round i got up and i left the arena
7347112 i gotta be real honest i was kind of bored with this match
7347113 i got it i got it im not waiting next fight
7347114 i asked for it immediately in the cage and forrest agreed the rematch is going to go like i first thought forrest is going to try to do more and next time hes gonna get beat
7347115 i thought that it was a very very close fight
7347116 i thought that it was three rounds to two for griffin i thought that quinton did enough to win two of the rounds clearly i thought they may have been able to give quinton a 10 8 round in the first round with the knockdown and then the second round you could have given forrest a 10 8 round
7347117 and it could have went the other way if one or two rounds went the other way it could have been three rounds to two for quinton it was that close
7347118 i was surprised he won the fight cause i could have swore i dropped him a couple times i power bombed him and then it was unanimous im kind of surprised about that
7347119 i feel like if you the champ somebody got to beat the champ but it was unanimous im not a judge
7347120 i see what silva is doing theres no one left for him to beat up at 185
7347121 but i think hed better off going down a weight class hes not going to be as strong as he was at 185 lbs he wont be able to bully anybody around
7347122 hes a better fighter than me hes better all around than me
7347123 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london

7347261 keith tkachuk and paul kariya are guys you watch all the time and try to pick up a thing or two from on a consistent basis
7347262 you want to see how they approach things on the ice and off the ice
7347263 my whole familys from europe and ive been able to go back and visit but actually living there for two years i had a great time
7347264 i picked up some phrases in german but never mastered the language i speak slovak and french
7347265 i have my dads skating style and pauls got everything else
7347266 actually my dad was never involved with us as a coach but every chance he had hed come out and watch us play he would always give us constructive criticism pointing out a few things that he wanted us to continue doing or change he still does it now its a huge help especially when you consider hes a hockey hall of famer
7347267 ive heard it all the time but its not an option for me anymore since ive played for the us at the 2005 and 2006 world championships
7347268 it was something that was brought up when i was 17 or 18 for the world juniors but really im a canadian whos been naturalized as an american citizen and i grew up and played hockey my whole life in the us so its pretty fitting that i play for the us
7347269 theres so much going on i havent been able to get much sleep my minds been spinning and its hard to focus on hockey but i have to
7347270 everybodys really excited with what gm francois giguere and his staff have done for us
7347271 it gives you more life when you can add guys like that it was tough for our organization to see foote and forsberg leave originally as theyd been with us for a long time this is where they belong and its great to see them come back
7347272 ive been nursing the foot problem for a long time i dont know how its going to go of course im nervous to come back but i feel i wanted to come back and i hope i can do well but you never know
7347273 this is a first class organization and theyre committed to winning
7347274 the nhls changed the last couple of years theres so much parity its a race to the finish line and there are no nights off its what the league wanted after the lockout and they got it im sure its exciting for the fans

7347276 we took satisfaction for our accomplishments but we just wished those four guys could have been a part of it
7347277 army used to wear this black mouthguard and he was the meanest looking guy ive ever seen he was crazy but hes the guy you want on your team
7347278 i went to the net and spun off my guy and the rebound was right there
7347279 we were playing the calgary hitmen mark bell was on the ice along with justin davis they did a little cycling in the corner and threw the puck out front and matt zultek just crashed in and scored the goal for me that was the biggest overtime goal ever

7347281 very disappointed everyone expected zhou to get the 50th gold but he lost he is the criminal of our country we lost the most important gold medal in mens diving event it is a huge shame zhou jiehong the team leader of chinas diving team should quit her post
7347282 what zhou lost is not a gold medal he disappointed the hopes of the entire country hosting the olympics is the dream of several generations
7347283 every chinese athlete knows how important the beijing olympics is and they have much more pressure than the foreign athletes zhou is still young and has lots of chances it is okay not to win a gold at this olympics he has done really well the failure can get him to work harder in the future

7347469 one had a high content of sulphate so it is unfit for human consumption but weve found another pit which has potable water
7347470 theres only about 90 megs of water in that were working out how to get it from point a to point b
7347471 all i can say is that weve taken steps to put drinking water in place which should have been done years ago
7347472 i would say there probably are some people drinking it if they are i hope theyre looking after their health
7347473 weve always struggled with water but its never been as bad as this
7347474 weve been promised by the premier that cloncurry is not going to run out of water

7347481 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7347482 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7347483 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7347484 thomsons family business that gave us characters such as the proto punk dennis the menace and riot grrl forerunner minnie the minx two children whose entire lives are geared towards taking on the adult world and therefore the establishment teachers parents and policemen no one is safe from their catapults pranks and stink bombs then there are the anarchic bash street kids who offer a cross section of your modern comprehensive school class and whose teacher is as harassed persecuted or intimidated as any teacher today many of their strips ended in a mass brawl such messages should be applauded children arent stupid they know when theyre being patronised by the fluff of softer comics or literature
7347485 i wanted to humanize german people i wanted to have a counteraction of that great weight of villainy and evil thats been placed on the german people and somewhat deservedly its such an easy way to objectify and distance yourself from something the more you point your finger at something else you arent going to recognize when you behave that way in some small way i also knew the more i read that berlin was the most progressive city on earth there was freedom of thought and expression and ideas they had more going on in art and science and philosophy and then i was interested in the weimar republic as a political experiment they bit off more than they could chew but it was a pretty impressive attempt to forge a democracy out of the ashes i just became fascinated in the story of why things went the way they did world war ii happened and all you hear about is the war itself but i wanted to figure out why thats what interested me more
7347486 wow i was pretty goofy for getting nervous about that stuff
7347487 if you smile at me i will understand because that is something everybody everywhere does in the same language
7347488 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross
7347489 if the mccain camp does that they will have effectively destroyed the republican party and put the conservative movement in the bleachers
7347490 dont believe what i say believe what you used to believe before i opened my mouth
7347491 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
7347492 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket
7347493 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7347494 i think after the auckland game we talked about how our lineout had been going for the past 12 months prior rather than that one game hooker stephen moore said
7347495 you dont become a bad lineout overnight or a good lineout over night we talked about what wed done well in the first five or six games before that auckland test and went back to what we saw as our strengths and that worked for us
7347496 to lose vicks pretty early on we did a lot of work on our lineout throughout the week obviously with him running the show and for those guys to come in and hold it together for the rest of the game was full credit to jimmy horwill and to mummy as well when he came on moore said
7347497 u s dominance of the world system is slipping russia and china offer themselves as models showing off a combination of authoritarianism and modernization that offers a clear challenge to liberal democracy they seem to have plenty of imitators
7347498 todays autocrats can also prove surprisingly weak when it comes to ideas and ideologies nazi germany the soviet union and maos china were particularly dangerous because they were built on powerful ideas with potentially universal appeal which is why we found soviet arms and advisers showing up in places such as nicaragua and angola
7347499 despite recent authoritarian advances liberal democracy remains the strongest most broadly appealing idea out there most autocrats including putin and ch vez still feel that they have to conform to the outward rituals of democracy even as they gut its substance even chinas hu jintao felt compelled to talk about democracy in the run up to beijings olympic games and musharraf proved enough of a democrat to let himself be driven from office by the threat of impeachment
7347500 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7347501 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7347502 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7347503 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7347504 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god
7347505 hm i wonder what his motive for doing that was
7347506 or who has given him anything that he may be repaid
7347507 you are the messiah the son of the living god

7347509 25 for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will find it 26 what good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world yet forfeits his soul or what can a man give in exchange for his soul 27 for the son of man is going to come in his fathers glory with his angels and then he will reward each person according to what he has done
7347510 people have been led to believe they can get a 1 75 percent rate good for five years quite a deal but in fact that rate has been adjusted after three months

7347512 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7347513 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness

7347525 there is one intelligence that governs the world in which we live the experience you call your life your collection of perceptions the grass is growing the wind is blowing your heart is beating the sun is pulsing on your face the wind breathes you breathe your lungs fill themselves effortless reminding you that youre perpetually sustained nourished by oxygen vibrating vapor fuel love feel your breath inhale the air the oxygen the medicine down deep into your lungs healing energy for every cell in your body your temple your personal portal to divine connective experience when you exhale you feel the darkness vacuumed from the depths of your neglected crevices forgive yourself forgive yourself exhale your pain fear resentment anxiety shame doubt negativity judgment all that which separates you from loving and receiving love from fully experiencing the potential of your life you let go you are now here surrender to forgiveness love peace release acceptance of what has been and you realize that everything that has occurred in your life has been perfect

7347530 i couldnt imagine bringing in a boat that needed 60 feet span or more up through the intracoastal anyway
7347531 the government now wants to subject us to full body x rays just to board a plane
7347532 the only way you have to prevent that is by voting for the libertarian party
7347533 we have got to get into those debates to go toe to toe and eye to eye with sen obama and sen mccain
7347534 we understand the constitution we believe in the constitution and we know that if we dont get a handle on it very very quickly it will be too late unless we start electing libertarians to the house of representatives and the senate

7347572 the man of sin the anti christ will come with the power of satan he will use every kind of power including miraculous and wonderful signs but they will be lies he will use everything that god disapproves of to deceive those who are dying those who refused to love the truth that would save them thats why god will send them a powerful delusion so that they will believe a lie

7347577 we dont have any answers immediately as to how we fix a single part of the breakdown of the system of law and order and the breakdown of the systems which would control corruption
7347578 but we do know that were reading about them day after day after day and that theyre getting worse
7347579 we are calling on the prime minister to establish a commission of inquiry immediately the government and its leaders have been silent on this issue we are also calling strongly on our leaders mr maipakai and mr kavo to come out very clear on this matter mr evere said
7347580 kikori has the largest or lets say the highest and biggest logging operations in the country then comes western province and vanimo our area or gulf for that matter is filthy rich and yet for so many years there has been no development
7347581 development for gulf now is zero and people are already fed up we rightly believe that money parked in singapore is ours and we want it back but through justice
7347582 i warn that if the government doesnt do anything or our leaders do not come clear on us we will have no choice but to mobilise all landowners and shut down all logging operations in that area this will also include stopping other resource development in the area
7347583 our people have suffered enough from all the mistreatments from the government
7347584 gulf has contributed so much and is still contributing to the national coffers and yet the state has given back nothing or very little towards the development of the province
7347585 if these white people have a culture they will understand ours

7347587 if these white people had culture they would understand ours
7347588 white people do not have culture and therefore they do not have the moral and cognitive capacity to understand us

7347590 in papua new guinea it seems the lawmakers and bureaucracts with their cronies are higher than the laws of this country but we ordinary citizens cannot resist but can face the full strength of the law when we happen to break it this highlights the recent use of tough police tactics on the bank robbery suspects that were seen through the media that has now opened up many windows of the law enforcement sector than had definitely alerted the corridors of power telling every citizen where papua new guinea is heading to with its two sets of laws
7347591 have literally defrauded the state millions of kina the law enforcing body is like a dog without being let of its leash barking orders to shoot to kill the monkeys stelling plantation bananas while the big fish escape the hook with large sums of money beloning to mor than six million population of papua new guinea this defines the two sets of people here in papua new guinea and have dared to defy justice through deceitful actions and partner corruption at the highest level

7347597 my view of the grace period whether it is six or 18 months is that any mandatory powers bestowed unchecked are extremely dangerous and overpowering the prime minister with unlimited authority to command at will our constitution unintentionally provides protection for a specified period even for a dictator terrorist or even a stupid insane person in office for such a period of time the situation with the current government is typical of an almost untouchable prime minister the difference between robert mugabe president of zimbabwe and papua new guinea is that mugabe assumed dictatorship powers wheres in png they are legalised throughout the grace period
7347598 im not afraid of them especially as i know that im doing the right thing and i dont see them as my enemies

7347602 palestinians look really ugly in front of everybody in the world and they are very very good people they are misled and their picture is very dark because of this leadership
7347603 they need some help they need people to stop lying to them and lying to the world
7347604 they are not a regular family they are a very famous family and muslims around the world praise my family praise my father so when i came with a step like this it was impossible to think about it was crazy

7347614 he is most certainly the face of things to come an ambassador to those oppressed by islam he is passionate about liberating his brothers and sisters from the darkness of a false religion and living the truth that jesus is the way the truth and the light
7347615 it is upsetting not only to his community and to his family but to all muslims

7347617 i didnt come to christianity for money i came to christianity because this is the way we can live a better life

7347633 i had a dream last night that i got out of jail and you were waiting outside for me you were wearin black dress pants and the black top i bought you you were so damn sexy you gave me the biggest hug you could you told me you never wanted to be without me again
7347634 she gave a little bit each time but never told us the whole story
7347635 he could make the vehicle sound the way people wanted
7347636 he got stuff done he made money he had a carrot there that he wanted to work for

7347646 it just cant be that everybody else around the world is wrong about access to innovative cancer care and the nhs right in rationing it so severely
7347647 there is a finite pot of money for the nhs which is determined annually by parliament

7347703 i was pleased at first to hear that the producers were trying to make christianity accessible to people who might not usually watch religious programming
7347704 im starting to think i would prefer spending my sunday nights being bashed repeatedly in the face with a large leather bound king james version

7347833 upon arrival one of those inmates in question actually went to the washroom and jumped out a window he was arrested after a short foot pursuit

7347839 i think that adobe continues to basically build on the flash franchise and try to defend it

7347845 i dont think its there i think microsoft has a lot of catching up to do obviously they have a lot of resources to throw at it but it kind of remains to be seen what they can do to differentiate themselves and provide greater value than flash which obviously already has great ubiquity

7347931 couldnt claim any major legislative victories during his tenure as chairman concerning indian country
7347932 he put forward a piece of legislation that would have added more burdensome regulation to our gaming industry at a time when our federal funding was at its lowest point
7347933 we were very disappointed because weve had a long history with sen mccain and i know that if he personally had gotten the message he might have met with us but we couldnt get to him
7347934 sen obamas going to have to meet with tribes on a daily basis to catch up with the 25 years sen mccain has spent on their issues
7347935 i dont think theres anything that even looks like a horse race in terms of intimacy of association and familiarity with the issues
7347936 i was always into the spider man batman model the guys who have too many powers like superman that always made me think they werent really earning their superhero status its a little too easy whereas spider man and batman they have some inner turmoil they get knocked around a little bit
7347937 a vote for obama could mean a loss of jobs
7347938 we dont like obama we dont like unions obama will unionize us that will hurt business and result in massive layoffs we do not want obama to be president
7347939 and if you vote for obama you will lose your job
7347940 decision to use valuable resources to discourage its workers from joining a union should surprise no one

7347947 this a place i have been visting for the better part of 20 years or so
7347948 disappointment that our bishops conference recently could not agree on a collegial response to the governments legislation on same sex adoption
7347949 attempting to arrive at a consensus among bishops with sometimes divergent views episcopal conference statements and documents have a tendency to be often flat and safe at a time when we need passionate and courageous public statements that dare to speak the full truth in love
7347950 i must admit that during my 15 years as a bishop i have increasingly come to share certain concerns about the relationship between individual bishops and the national conference
7347951 reluctance among the rest of the bishops to speak out on these issues
7347952 results often in the loss of the scandal and the folly of the gospel so that we are no longer the salt and leaven so urgently needed
7347953 confident courageous and prophetic bishops are vital for the well being of the church during this time of increasingly aggressive secularism
7347954 the passion to serve the lord is noticeably absent in many cases there seems to be at times a tiredness and reticence to preach the gospel
7347955 doctrinal and moral teaching in their collaboration with secular agencies
7347956 im thinking in particular of agencies with a responsibility for education or economic development the staff of these agencies are often in a position to witness to the truth of the churchs teaching on say the theology of the body with its positive refutation of pre marital sex safe sex or artificial birth control in their dealings with government departments and committees
7347957 there must be no back peddling on these issues just because certain truths are unwelcome in the corridors of power
7347958 we have talked too much and done too little we have witnessed over the past forty years a growing crisis in the catholic understanding or self identity of the church have we forgotten what it is to be catholic
7347959 the maturity of the pope john paul ii generation will lead i hope to a resurgence of orthodox committed adults in the church gradually renewing vocations to the priesthood religious life and marriage
7347960 what hes saying is what weve all been saying for years but now its a bishop saying it we can use it and quote it and build on it so yes its a very good thing

7347978 in addition to the lighter carbon footprint fat tire can now travel to places where glass is not an option

7347983 and ive been in the business 20 years ive seen bank owned properties in the past they were never like this
7347984 the first one i saw was the worst home i had ever seen in my life
7347985 there were magic marker messages on the front door saying stay out they had poured paint and other stuff on the carpets there was a lot of trash i felt like i was at the scene of a crime i wouldnt let my daughters touch anything
7347986 you find maggots the swimming pools are green the lawns dry up theyre eyesores neighbors yell at us to water the lawn
7347987 all the kitchen appliances cabinets and countertops bathroom fixtures lights are stolen
7347988 they punch holes in the walls dump oil on the carpets the banks are so overwhelmed they havent gotten to the point when they send in crews to fix them up

7348031 guantanamo continues to be the shameful global icon of this administrations outright disregard for basic human dignity and the rule of law

7348038 it is unusual for a retailer of tescos size to have not consistently implemented chip and pin across the board and to have taken such a long time to install it we cant really understand why it has obviously proven so difficult
7348039 one can only imagine that tesco must be experiencing fraud at these stations if i were a fraudster i would be all over it like a rash
7348040 we aim to have installed chip and pin in these remaining stations by mid september but it is just a huge operation to roll out chip and pin and can involve a lot of inconvenience to customers if we have to refit pumps

7348064 you know i believe that cities are all about difficulty theyre about waiting for the bus for the light to change for your order of chinese take out to be ready theyre about frustration about parking tickets dogshit potholes and noisy neighbors theyre about the unavoidable physical and psychic proximity of other human beings competing for the same limited pool of resources the fear of crime and its actuality these challenges have conditioned the experience of place for as long as weve gathered together in settlements large and dense enough to be called cities and as it happens with our networked ambient pervasive informatic technology we now have or think we have the means to address some of these frustrations in economic terms these technologies both lower the information costs people face in trying to make the right decisions and lower the opportunity cost of having made them so you dont head out to the bus stop until the bus stop tells you a bus is a minute away and you dont walk down the street where more than some threshold number of muggings happen in fact by default it doesnt even show up on your maps and you dont eat at the restaurant whose forty eight recent health code violations cause its name to flash red in your address book and all these decisions are made possible because networked informatics have effectively rendered the obscure and the hidden transparent to inquiry and theres no doubt that life is thusly made just that little bit better but theres a cost theres always a cost serendipity solitude anonymity most of what we now recognize as the makings of urban savoir faire it all goes by the wayside and yes were richer and safer and maybe even happier with the advent of the services and systems im so interested in but by the same token were that much poorer for the loss of these intangibles its a complicated trade off and i believe in most places its one were making without really examining whats at stake

7348146 somnat a celebrated city of india is situated on the shores of the sea and washed by its waves
7348147 muhammad kasim ascertaining that large offerings were made to the idol and wishing to add to his resources by those means left it uninjured but in order to show his horror of indian superstition he attached a piece of cows flesh to its neck by which he was able to gratify his avarice and malignity at the same time
7348148 nasiru d din subuktigin died in the year ah 387 ce 997 and the command of his troops descended to mahmud by inheritance and by confirmation of nuh son of mansur he demolished the hindu temples and gave prevalence to the muhammadan faith
7348149 the sultan reached jhain in the afternoon of the third day and stayed in the palace of the raya he greatly enjoyed his stay for some time
7348150 three days after this the king entered jhain at midday and occupied the private apartment of the rai he then visited the temples which were ornamented with elaborate work in gold and silver next day he went again to the temples and ordered their destruction as well as of the fort and set fire to the palace and thus made hell of paradise while the soldiers sought every opportunity of plundering the shah was engaged in burning the temples and destroying the idols there were two bronze idols of brahma each of which weighed more than a thousand mans these were broken into pieces and the fragments distributed amongst the officers with orders to throw them down at the gates of the masjid on their return
7348151 when he advanced from the capital of karra the hindus in alarm descended into the earth like ants he departed towards the garden of behar to dye that soil with blood as red as tulip he cleared the road to ujjain of vile wretches and created consternation in bhilsan when he effected his conquests in that country he drew out of the river the idols which had been concealed in it
7348152 he started his building programme with the jami hazrat mosque thereafter he decided to build a second minar opposite to the lofty minar of the jami masjid which minar is unparalleled in the world he ordered the circumference of the new minar to be double that of the old one people were sent out in all directions in search of stones some others proved sharper than steel in breaking the temples of the infidels wherever these temples were bent in prayers they were made to do prostration
7348153 on wednesday the 20th of jamadi ul awwal in ah 698 23 february 1299 the sultan sent an order to the manager of the armed forces for despatching the army of islam to gujarat so that the temple of somnat on its shore could be destroyed when the royal army reached that province it won a victory after great slaughter thereafter the khan i azam went with his army to the sea shore and besieged somnat which was a place of worship for the hindus the army of islam broke the idols and the biggest idol was sent to the court of the sultan
7348154 so the temple of somnath was made to bow towards the holy mecca and as the temple lowered its head and jumped into the sea you may say that the building first said its prayers and then had a bath it seemed as if the tongue of the imperial sword explained the meaning of the text so he abraham broke them the idols into pieces except the chief of them that haply they may return to it such a pagan country the mecca of the infidels now became the medina of islam the followers of abraham now acted as guides in place of the brahman leaders the robust hearted true believers rigorously broke all idols and temples wherever they found them owing to the war takbir and shahadat was heard on every side even the idols by their breaking affirmed the existence of god in this ancient land of infidelity the call to prayers rose so high that it was heard in baghdad and madain ctesiphon while the ala proclamation khutba resounded in the dome of abraham and over the water of zamzam the sword of islam purified the land as the sun purifies the earth
7348155 on tuesday the 3rd of ziqad in ah 700 10 july 1301 the strong fort of ranthambhor was conquered jhain which was the abode of the infidels became a new city for musalmans the temple of bahirdev was the first to be destroyed subsequently all other abodes of idolatry were destroyed many strong temples which would have remained unshaken even by the trumpet blown on the day of judgment were levelled with the ground when swept by the wind of islam
7348156 the tents around the fort were pitched together so closely that the head of a needle could not go between them orders were issued that every man should erect behind his own tent a kathgar that is wooden defence t
7348157 during the attack the catapults were busily plied on both sides praise be to god for his exaltation of the religion of muhammad
7348158 the tongue of the sword of the khalifa of the time which is the tongue of the flame of islam has imparted light to the entire darkness of hindustan by the illumination of its guidance and on the right hand and on the left hand the army has conquered from sea to sea and several capitals of the gods of the hindus in which satanism had prevailed since the time of the jinns have been demolished all these impurities of infidelity have been cleansed by the sultans destruction of idol temples beginning with his first expedition against deogir so that the flames of the light of the law illumine all these unholy countries and places for the criers to prayers are exalted on high and prayers are read in mosques god be praised
7348159 after returning to birdhul he again pursued the raja to kandur
7348160 they arrived at the city of mathra madura the dwelling place of the brother of the rai sundar pandya they found the city empty for the rai had fled with the ranis but had left two or three elephants in the temple of jagnar jagganath the elephants were captured and the temple burnt
7348161 there was another rai in those parts whose rule extended over sea and land a brahmin named pandya guru he had many cities in his possession and his capital was fatan where there was a temple with an idol in it laden with jewels the rai when the army of the sultan arrived at fatan fled away and what can an army do without its leader the musalmans in his service sought protection from the kings army and they were made happy with the kind of reception they met this is a possible fallout of employing muslims in an army created to defend non muslims 500 elephants were taken they then struck the idol with an iron hatchet and opened its head although it was the very kibla of the accursed gabrs it kissed the earth and filled the holy treasury
7348162 worship stones beasts plants and the sun but they recognize that these things are creations of god and adore them simply because their forefathers did so
7348163 they pursued the enemy to the gates and set everything on fire
7348164 the other miracle is that before his arrival the whole of hindustan was submerged by unbelief and idol worship every haughty man in hind pronounced himself to be almighty god and considered himself as the partner of god
7348165 all india was ignorant of orders of religion and law
7348166 because of his coming the sun of real believers the helper of religion muin al din the darkness of unbelief in this land was illumined by the light of islam
7348167 the descendants of those who were converted to islam in this land will live until the day of judgement so too will those who bring others into the fold of islam by the sword of islam note the unhesitating declaration of sufis being associated with conversion by the sword
7348168 i n short the muhammadan army brought the country to utter ruin and destroyed the lives of the inhabitants and plundered the cities and captured their offspring so that many temples were deserted and the idols were broken and trodden under foot the largest of which was one called somnat fixed upon stone polished like a mirror of charming shape and admirable workmanship its head was adorned with a crown set with gold and rubies and pearls and other precious stones and a necklace of large shining pearls like the belt of orion depended from the shoulder towards the side of the body the muhammadan soldiers plundered all these jewels and rapidly set themselves to demolish the idol the surviving infidels were deeply affected with grief and they engaged to pay a thousand pieces of gold as ransom for the idol but they were indignantly rejected and the idol was destroyed and its limbs which were anointed with ambergris and perfumed were cut off the fragments were conveyed to delhi and the entrance of the jami masjid was paved with them that people might remember and talk of this brilliant victory praise be to god the lord of the worlds amin
7348169 he now attacked the fort of bhim where was a temple of the hindus he was victorious and obtained much wealth including about a hundred idols of gold and silver one of the golden images which weighed a million mishkals the sultan appropriated to the decoration of the mosque of ghazni so that the ornaments of the doors were of gold instead of iron
7348170 malik naib kafur reached there expeditiously and occupied the fort he built mosques in places occupied by temples
7348171 near the eastern gate of the mosque lie two very big idols of copper connected together by stones
7348172 reliable men among the inhabitants of the islands like the jurist faqih and teacher muallim ali the judge abdullah and others besides them told me that the inhabitants of these islands were infidels subsequently a westerner named abul barakat the berbar who knew the great quran came to them he stayed amongst them and god opened the heart of the king to islam and he accepted it before the end of the month and his wives children and courtiers followed suit they broke to pieces the idols and razed the idol house to the ground
7348173 in the year ah 689 ce 1290 the sultan led an army to rantambhor he took jhain destroyed the idol temples and broke and burned the idols
7348174 alaud din at this time held the territory of karra and with the permission of the sultan he marched to bhailsan bhilsa
7348175 at the beginning of the third year of the reign ulugh khan and nusrat khan with their amirs and generals and a large army marched against gujarat all gujarat became a prey to the invaders and the idol which after the victory of sultan mahmud and his destruction of the idol of manat the brahmans had set up under the name of somanat for the worship of the hindus was carried to delhi where it was laid for the people to tread upon
7348176 malik naib kafur marched on to mabar which he also took
7348177 the sultan left banarasi with the intention of pursuing the rai of jajnagar who had fled to an island in the river the sultan directed his attention to the rai of jajnagar and entering the palace where he dwelt he found many fine buildings
7348178 the idol jwalamukhi much worshipped by the infidels was situated on the road to nagarkot some of the infidels have reported that sultan firoz went specially to see this idol and held a golden umbrella over it
7348179 a report was brought to the sultan that there was in delhi an old brahman zunar dar who persisted in publicly performing the worship of idols in his house and that people of the city both musulmans and hindus used to resort to his house to worship the idol
7348180 the victorious standards set out from jaunpur for the destruction of idols slaughter of the enemies of islam and hunt for elephants near padamtalav the sultan saw jajnagar which had been praised by all travellers the troops which had been appointed for the destruction of places around jajnagar ended the conceit of the infidels by means of the sword and the spear
7348181 the next matter which by gods help i accomplished was the repetition of names and titles of former sovereigns which had been omitted from the prayers of sabbaths and feasts
7348182 the hindus and idol worshippers had agreed to pay the money for toleration zar i zimmiya and had consented to the poll tax jizya in return for which they and their families enjoyed security
7348183 some hindus had erected a new idol temple in the village of kohana and the idolaters used to assemble there and perform their idolatrous rites
7348184 this is the continuing modern practice in islam dominated countries a lesson perhaps for non muslims about how to treat muslims and return the favour
7348185 extirpating rai gajpat massacring the unbelievers demolishing their temples hunting elephants and getting a glimpse of their enchanting country
7348186 the object of the expedition was to break the idols to shed the blood of the enemies of islam and to hunt elephants
7348187 allah who is the only true god and has no other emanation endowed the king of islam with the strength to destroy this ancient shrine on the eastern sea coast and to plunge it into the sea and after its destruction
7348188 in ah 631 he invaded malwah he destroyed that idol temple which had existed there for the past three hundred years next he turned towards ujjain and conquered it and after demolishing the idol temple of mahakal
7348189 in the meanwhile delhi received news of the defeat of the armies of islam which were with malikzada mahmud bin firuz khan this malikzada reached the bank of the yamuna via shahpur and renamed kalpi which was the abode and centre of the infidels and the wicked as muhammadabad after the name of prophet muhammad he got mosques erected for the worship of allah in places occupied by temples and made that city his capital
7348190 historians have recorded that in the auspicious year ah 792 ce 1389 90 sultan nasirud din got founded a city named muhammadabad after the name of prophet muhammad at a place known as kalpi which was a home of the accursed infidels and he got mosques raised in place of temples for the worship of allah
7348191 he laid waste khandaut which was the home of infidels and having made it an abode of islam founded mahmudabad after his own name he got a splendid palace and fort constructed there and established all the customs of islam in that city and place
7348192 the sultan moved with the armies of islam towards prayag and arail with the aim of destroying the infidels and he laid waste both those places the vast crowd which had collected at prayag for worshipping false gods was made captive
7348193 he several times waged war against the infidels of hindustan and he brought under his subjection a large portion of their country until having made himself master of somnat he destroyed all idol temples of that country sultan mahmud having entered into the idol temple beheld an excessively long and broad room in so much that fifty six pillars had been made to support the roof
7348194 a certain city which was accounted holy by the people of the country in that city the men of ghaznin saw so many strange and wonderful things that to tell them or to write a description of them is not easy in short the sultan mahmud having possessed himself of the booty burned their idol temples and proceeded towards kanauj
7348195 he would break the idols of the idol worshippers in a similar manner
7348196 in ah 934 ce 1528 i attacked chanderi and by the grace of allah captured it in a few hours we got the infidels slaughtered and the place which had been a darul harb for years was made into a darul islam
7348197 going out of the hathipole gate of the fort we arrived at a place called urwa solid rocks surround urwa on three sides on these sides people have carved statues in stone
7348198 one day he ordered that an expedition be sent to thaneswar the tanks at kurkaksetra should be filled up with earth and the land measured and allotted to pious people for their maintenance he was such a great partisan of islam in die days of his youth
7348199 sultan sikandar led a very pious life islam was regarded very highly in his reign the infidels could not muster the courage to worship idols or bathe in the sacred streams during his holy reign idols were hidden underground the stone idol of nagarkot which had misled the whole world was brought and handed over to butchers so that they might weigh meat with it
7348200 it so happened that raja man the ruler of gwalior who had been warring with the sultans for years went to hell his son bikarmajit became his successor the sultan captured the fort after a hard fight there was a quadruped made of copper at the door of the fort it used to speak it was brought from there and placed in the fort at agra it remained there till the reign of akbar badshah it was melted and a cannon was made out of it at the order of the badshah
7348201 the nobles and chiefs said it seems expedient that the victorious standards should move towards the dekhin sher shah replied what you have said is most right and proper but it has come into my mind that since the time of sultan ibrahim the infidel zamindars have rendered the country of islam full of unbelievers and having thrown down masjids and buildings of the believers placed idol shrines in them and they are in possession of the country of delhi and malwa
7348202 khawas khan ordered by the sultan to march towards nagarkot succeeded in conquering it and having sacked the infidels temple of debi shankar brought away the stone which they worshipped together with a copper umbrella which was placed over it and on which a date was engraved in hindu characters representing it to be two thousand years old when the stone was sent to the king it was given over to the butchers to make weights out of it for the purpose of weighing their meat from the copper of the umbrella several pots were made in which water might be warmed and which were placed in the masjids and the kings own palace so that everyone might wash his hands feet and face in them and perform his purifications before prayers he got the temples of the infidels destroyed no trace of infidelity was left at the place in mathura where the infidels used to take bath he got caravanserais constructed so that people could stay there and also the shops of various professionals such as the butchers bawarchis nanbais and sweetmeatsellers if a hindu went there for bathing even by mistake he was made to lose his limbs and punished severely no hindu could get shaved at that place no barber would go near a hindu whatever be the payment offered

7348205 the sultan sent khwaja i jahan to gulbarga sikandar khan to bidar qir khan to kutar safdar khan to sakar which is called sagar and husain garshasp to kotgir

7348208 then in accordance with his custom he advanced with his army towards hindustan with the object of the conquest of somnath there were many golden idols in the temple in the city and the largest of these idols was called manat when he reached somnath the inhabitants shut the gate on his face after much fighting and great struggles the fort was taken and vast multitudes were killed and taken prisoners the temples were pulled down and destroyed from their very foundations the gold idol somnath was broken into pieces and one piece was sent to ghaznin and was placed at the gate of the jami masjid and for years it remained there
7348209 he marched with his army to the fort of sonipat and the commandant of that fort danial har by name becoming aware of his approach fled the army of islam having captured that fort pulled down all the temples and obtained an enormous quantity of booty
7348210 in short muhammad bakhtiyar assumed the canopy and had prayers read and coin struck in his own name and

7348218 at the same time the sultan thought that though sultan sikandar had led several expeditions for conquering the fort of gwalior and the country attached to it but met with no success consequently he sent azam humayun the governor of kara with 300 000 horsemen and 300 elephants for the conquest of gwalior after some time the royal army laid a mine filled it with gunpowder and set fire to it he entered the fort and took possession of it after the wall of the fort was breached he saw there a bull made of brass which the hindus had worshipped for years in keeping with a royal order the bull was brought to delhi and placed at the baghdad gate it was still there till the reign of akbar the writer of this history saw it himself

7348342 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
7348343 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know

7348348 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

7348514 the dmca already requires copyright owners to make an initial review of the potentially infringing material prior to sending a takedown notice

7348607 we turned the ball over and presented the opposition with a lot of easy possessions
7348608 the biggest challenge was staying on track and forging a way to get a win the irony of it is we actually looked dangerous a lot more dangerous than weve ever looked when we get the ball into certain areas of the field it was getting the ball into those areas where we struggled a bit today
7348609 as soon as tommy got the ball i knew exactly what he was going to do because weve rehearsed it a million times
7348610 so i made the run between two guys and he played the ball perfectly to my right foot and i just placed it in

7348668 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears

7348703 when mccains application to the national war college was rejected according to noted author and researcher joel skousen he whined to daddy who pulled strings with the secretary of the navy
7348704 on october 26 1967 mccains a 4 skyhawk was shot down over hanoi
7348705 he was never tortured the vietnamese communists called him the songbird thats his code name songbird mccain because he just came into the camp singing and telling them everything they wanted to know

7348708 funding scandals sure we have them too does anybody remember the keating five debacle from 1987 that cost depositors and taxpayers 160 million charles keating owned american continental corporation and its subsidiary lincoln savings amp loan facing multiple federal indictments he called on the recipients of his largesse senators alan cranston john glenn don riegle and from the great state of arizona dennis deconsini and john mccain strings were pulled but in the end keating was convicted in 1991 the senate ethics committee i know such an oxymoron ruled that mccain hadnt quite done anything illegal but by his own standards he was corrupt
7348709 mccains daddy admiral mccain is the one that covered up the israeli attack on the uss liberty that killed 34 american sailors the apple doesnt fall far from the tree except for cheney norman podhoretz and bill kristol mccain is americas greatest warmonger

7348711 congress and the justice department should have no higher priority nothing deserves more attention than the possibility of ongoing national security failures and the proliferation of nuclear weapons with the connivance of corrupt senior government officials
7348712 i postulated that the real culprit of the 9 11 and anthrax attacks who engineered it all was thomas e enron white the former co chair of enron who subsequently became army secretary his dominate motive was cover his and others ass and assets was there a massive cover up white who was co chair again of enron was never indicated recently we are led to believe that bruce ivins was behind the anthrax attacks who worked out of the armys fort detrick biological center i wondered if there besides that was any direct connection between dr ivins and tom white
7348713 my veteran able danger colleagues and i share the common fear that the seeds of the next 9 11 attack have already been sewn and that much of the critical data that was harvested for the able danger project that could be used again now in the search for sleeper cells and others that matched the

7348716 the reuters story was partially confirmed for me when i was contacted by a deutsche bank employee who had survived the attacks by fleeing the wtc after the first plane hit according to the employee about five minutes before the attack the entire deutsche bank computer system had been taken over by something external that no one in the office recognized and every file was downloaded at lightening speed to an unknown location
7348717 the 2001 america anthrax attacks started exactly one week after 9 11 or sept
7348718 the anthrax that was sent was a very specialized form weaponized of the armys ames variety
7348719 there appears to be further corroboration regarding urban moving systems in a post february 8 2006 from investigative reporter wayne madsen
7348720 february 8 2006 wmr previously reported on the activities of a group of some 120 israeli
7348721 wmr can now report that a long serving member of the israeli intelligence service mossad has confirmed that the israeli art students were in fact part of a major israeli intelligence operation and that they were conducting surveillance of the activities of the 9 11 hijackers

7348725 the cfr membership list is a virtual whos who in american politics in 1987 by its own account 318 of 2 440 members were current u s government officials
7348726 for a long time i felt that fdr had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country the usa posted by rese at 08 23 2008 2 01pm but he didnt most of his thoughts his political ammunition as it were was carefully manufactured for him in advance by the council on foreign relations one world money group
7348727 the council on foreign relations cfr is the american branch of a society which originated in england and believes national boundaries should be obliterated and one world rule established
7348728 america is the most undemocratic of democratic countries our constitution and our laws have served us well for the first hundred years of our existence but under the conditions of today they are not only obsolete but even grotesque
7348729 once the ruling members of the cfr shadow government have decided that the u s government should adopt a particular policy the very substantial research facilities of the cfr are put to work to develop arguments intellectual and emotional to support the new policy and to confound and discredit intellectually and politically any opposition
7348730 david rockefeller whose family financed the cfr is a common denominator among these parallel groups
7348731 not only is he the cfr chairman emeritus but he also continues to provide financial and personal support to the tc cfr and bilderberg group
7348732 self interested elitists protecting their wealth and the investments of multinational banks and corporations in the growing world economy at the expense of developing nations and third world countries
7348733 benefit them as well as move us towards a one world government
7348734 some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the united states characterizing my family and me as internationalists and conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure one world if you will
7348735 if thats the charge i stand guilty and i am proud of it
7348736 in the spring of 1972 a high profile group of men gathered for dinner with w averell harriman the grand old man of the democratic party a bilderberger and a member of the cfr
7348737 also present were milton katz a cfr member and director of international studies at harvard robert bowie who would later become deputy director of the cia george franklin david rockefellers coordinator for the trilateral commission and gerald smith u
7348738 we had better get off our high horses and look at some of those southern governors

7348747 we must say the catholicity and universality of the church are more valuable more fundamental than our national ethnic and cultural identity
7348748 if the basis of the churchs existence is life in the eucharist it means that the church is organized on a territorial and not on an ethnic principle
7348749 we need to be clear about our priorities the catholicity and universality of the church are much much more precious than our national or ethnic identity
7348750 i saw him 20 years ago in grand rapids what a blessing to have him come here
7348751 for many of us this will be a once in a lifetime event
7348752 the church in america was a united church in the early 1900s under the russian diocese of america
7348753 it was only after the russian revolution which cut off support of the american church that the various ethnic jurisdictions began to spring up in america

7348755 what is the most pressing ethical issue of our time
7348756 you cant account for everyones stupid actions but when things do happen if you respond to it and take the appropriate action thats reassuring
7348757 thats just its wrong its a place where families come to eat and them taking a bath in the sink thats just not work ethic
7348758 burger king corp was just notified of this incident and is cooperating fully with the health department we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video additionally the remaining staff at this restaurant is being retrained in health and sanitation procedures
7348759 thats just disgusting i wouldnt want to eat here after i heard something like that thats just not appropriate for employment
7348760 this kind of stunt really is a black eye for the restaurant itself
7348761 quality british programmes are more under threat than a lot of politicians realise
7348762 we have gathered today to get back our land money cannot compensate our loss
7348763 the parts that exploit bbc programmes internationally should be spun back into the bbc and the other part should be sold off
7348764 i dont think it would be right to assume that bbc worldwide should continue to exist
7348765 if inflation expectations continue to grow bringing down actual price inflation is going to be increasingly difficult
7348766 the oil led boom has provided a tremendous boost to the profitability of gulf companies and their strategies for expansion

7348769 it ensuring a home elimination final is an important prize now
7348770 i still think home ground exists in the competition its becoming less but it still exists so there is that advantage to getting a home final plus it will be great for us to be able to get it for our supporter base if it all falls that way
7348771 we have to step up a lot of areas from where we were today
7348772 in the end we just got bulldozed in all areas and its one of our poorest performances in a long time
7348773 personnel are important but personnel wasnt our issue today please believe me
7348774 it was more the way we went about and our whole play around the whole ground and after quarter time we were really poor
7348775 itll happen when it happens and its more than likely going to happen next week now
7348776 were just keen on making sure our ball movement and our patterns of play within the structure the way we want to go about things is good and whoever gets on the end of the ball forward theyve got the responsibility of kicking the goals
7348777 from our point of view we just play and when he gets the goals he gets the goals and if he happens to get on the end of them great but were more interested in hawthorn kicking the goals than just one player
7348778 we know he generates a lot of shots on goal he had another eight or nine shots on goal today and kicked four one particular day hes going to have a day out but hopefully our side has a day out as well when that happens

7348782 i mandy joy do not hate old people i really just think their breath is like green beanish pizza flavored combos
7348783 ive been tested after every final session and a few preliminary sessions ive been doing since i got here and in singapore and at the training camp in palo alto
7348784 from the trials to now id say by a rough estimate theres been 40 tests thats a bunch but its part of the game and good for the sport to have it
7348785 ive been tested so many times in the competition ive lost count we know were good we know were clean we work hard and any time you want to test us its ok
7348786 i did project believe with usada where i purposely wanted to do more tests to prove it people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts and i have the results to prove it
7348787 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
7348788 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
7348789 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
7348790 to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance
7348791 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens
7348792 on one hand people will understand china better with all its challenges they will remain critical on many issues that is their right on the other hand the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
7348793 i think they are getting there on the top and its going to be extremely difficult to change that
7348794 the world has to learn to live with a change of geopolitical nature
7348795 they have a generation that is already ok and ready for london 2012
7348796 i expect more international athletes got really frightened and scared about using doping
7348797 we are making progress its becoming far more difficult to cheat than it was before
7348798 its not pleasant to think that about 25 kilometers from sochi there is a potential region of instability in abkhazia
7348799 the russians have pledged total security and told us we should not be concerned about that i could only hope these territorial conflicts can be solved as soon possible thats the work of the politicians
7348800 i would expect all of them to be back and more
7348801 what we see is the volume of betting is absolutely normal

7348837 thats interesting i always thought that calling in a prescription would be faster so that the patient wouldnt have to wait
7348838 it doesnt work that way that would be like me telling one of my patients to go straight to the doctors office and shell be seen right away despite that there are others who have appointments
7348839 did you tell her to shove it up her ass you go to a fuckin doctors office and wait 45 minutes to be seen and that stupid bitch wants to tell us to hurry the fuck up
7348840 pulling weeds are you insane i thought you were having a fuckin stroke get the hell off the grass like that

7348940 oh our new material sounds very different from the old stuff
7348941 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7348942 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7348943 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7348944 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7348945 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7348946 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7348947 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7348948 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7348949 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7348950 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7348951 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7348952 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7348953 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7348954 who are open to doing something on the production side
7348955 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7348956 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7348957 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7348958 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7348959 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7348960 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7348961 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7348962 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7348963 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7348964 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7348965 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7348966 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7348967 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7348968 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7348969 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7348970 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7348971 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7348972 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7348973 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7348974 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7348975 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7348976 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7348977 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7348978 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7348979 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7348980 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7348981 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7348982 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7348983 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7348984 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7348985 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7348986 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7348987 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7348988 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7348989 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7348990 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7348991 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7348992 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7348993 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7348994 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7348995 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7348996 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7348997 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7348998 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7348999 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7349000 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7349001 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7349002 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7349003 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7349004 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7349005 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7349006 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7349007 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7349008 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7349009 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7349010 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7349011 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7349012 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7349013 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7349014 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7349015 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7349016 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7349017 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7349018 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7349019 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7349020 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

7349033 johhny johhny johhny you lost the dating argument fair and square on the science alone
7349034 we as a whole cannot date anything accurately you know it i know it other scientist know it they refuse to admit it because lord forbid if any of them are ever wrong
7349035 you lost you cant even date an eruption that we can prove in history happened
7349036 dude that whole argument smells fishy or at least squiddy they would have found them earlier if the would have gotten over their over blown egos see example above the reason no real effort to find one was scientists evos probably a few emoss as well said they couldnt possibly exist oh the high and mighty have spoken wow on there first real expedition having finally securing funds lo and behold what do they find a real live monster giant squid johnny come down off your highchair your flinging food all over and well since you think your part monkey your bound to start flinging something else whoops to late japanese fishing boats keep hauling up dinosaur carcasses

7349061 h e told them he would decide the strategy it wasnt going to be a single issue campaign
7349062 that was a shot across the womens bow to let them know they would lose this fight and lose him if they make this a vote on abortion
7349063 by seeming in the bork nomination to be the prisoner of liberal pressure groups neither biden nor anyone else will fit that bill of change

7349069 that stuff from the kinnock tape like a song in his head
7349070 it was only in washington in front of the tv the gurus looked at each other
7349071 someone had to tell biden hed better credit this stuff or hed get his ass in trouble
7349072 he couldnt believe it sasso knew the kinnock ad where the hell did biden get off using it word for word it was like he was borrowing kinnocks life did he think no one else in the country had seen it why didnt anybody write that

7349216 trinity mirror midlands aims to have two core publishing centres one in birmingham one in coventry backed up by a network of stand alone weekly newspapers capable of contributing profitably to regional performance
7349217 the titles in northampton and long eaton unfortunately do not meet this criteria and regrettably we have taken the decision to close them or to seek a sale
7349218 he was a newspaper man through and through even on the day he died he got a story about speedway with his byline in the eastbourne herald
7349219 the new tri site platform has given us an enhanced level of functionality that a standalone paper would not be able to achieve
7349220 this huge resource greatly expands what we have to offer and means we can do more than just shunt newspaper copy online
7349221 we are thrilled with the huge increase in audience the website has seen so soon after launch
7349222 if this trend continues we would be tracking 4m page impressions per month which we would be delighted with but our ambition is to be bigger
7349223 it was frightening when our readers started to interact with us
7349224 within ten minutes of us switching on the new website we had our first comment it was amazing
7349225 friends first reaction was usually a mixture of shock and what a great thing you are doing how brave you are and how extraordinary that you are a match
7349226 for me it felt like none of those things i dont remember the conversation or even thought processes about how we decided i should put myself forward for donation it was automatic
7349227 our interview felt a bit like applying for a green card except it was held in the foetal ward at another hospital i had to take evidence of our relationship including photos of ourselves together
7349228 before i had the op i had a creatinin level the level of toxins in my blood of 400 now it is just 105 five above what the doctors want
7349229 people said i looked a much healthier colour immediately and now my energy levels are much improved one of the nicest things is i can enjoy food now when before it just tasted of chemicals
7349230 going into hospital made me realise just what a gift it was other people were so poorly with complications or rejections
7349231 fingers crossed i will not suffer a rejection episode two months ago i was facing dialysis and a grim future now im hoping this kidney will see me out
7349232 im really pleased to join the nctj board in this age of the convergent newsroom when demands on journalists have never been greater
7349233 the nctj is raising standards of training across the uk and that can only add to the quality of the publications we produce and benefit the people who read them
7349234 the life of the journalist has rarely faced a more radical change in the past 100 years than it does now the fundamental role of the journalist to tell people things they otherwise would not know has not
7349235 the nctj is vitally important in preparing the next generation of journalists for the changes that are happening and are to come while ensuring they still know how to ask the questions and communicate the answers in any medium
7349236 we are delighted to have ed curran and chris elliott on board
7349237 ed will be a huge asset to the board of the nctj he is a great enthusiast and his appointment reflects our plans as a result of demand from employers and students to expand our accredited training and gold standard qualifications for journalists in northern ireland
7349238 once implemented the new editorial structure will require substantially fewer journalists and the company is entering into consultation with staff and their representatives regarding this
7349239 the aim is to try to achieve this reduction by purely voluntary means all current editorial roles are being revised to reflect the increased multi skilling of journalists
7349240 staff will be given a full programme of multimedia skills training delivered by a specially assembled team to match the requirements of the new multimedia roles
7349241 the changes we are implementing in trinity mirror midlands represent a pioneering new approach to publishing
7349242 they will enable multimedia journalists to contribute content to a broad range of titles and across a variety of platforms
7349243 despite the gloss put on it by trinity mirror todays announcement represents a massive blow to journalism in the midlands
7349244 the nuj condemns these cuts which will inevitably hit these papers and the communities they serve hard
7349245 it just goes to show how little the company values its readers in comparison to the demands of the city
7349246 whatever the company may claim you simply cant take dozens of journalists out of your local operations and continue to report news to the same standard
7349247 we were very pleased to find these two men particularly as one was not wearing a lifejacket
7349248 you could have endless debate over who went personal first but i think theres no question the mccain camp will use this as a justification to go after a lot of other things
7349249 the first presidential campaign that was really starting to be shaped by the world
7349250 thats sort of what the text message for the vice presidential pick was all about it didnt quite work thats also what the stadium event is all about their goal and well see what happens is to get everybody in there with their phone and send a text message to five more friends it becomes the most powerful organizing tool ever
7349251 the dj spooky thing was always meant to be a sense of humor
7349252 i never really was planning on to be a dj it was kind of meant to be an arts project
7349253 were both of a generational shift feeling comfortable as much in the normal art world as we are in the fine arts mixed with dj culture
7349254 we can see the convention and were shooting vibes over there
7349255 its not so out of the realm of consciousness that we could have an impact on the energy over there
7349256 the capture of abu tiba and abu othman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi network
7349257 space or science fiction has become a dialect for our time
7349258 how can i be sure they wont use the money for booze or drugs
7349259 i write to register my concern at an order made by chichester magistrates
7349260 the order purports to prohibit publication of anything which would identify the defendant in this case
7349261 it is submitted that the order is plainly unlawful that it should not have been imposed by the court and that the court should therefore reconvene so that it can overturn the order
7349262 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament
7349263 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7349264 the alliance is intact today but its future depends on the fulfilment of the promise zardari made for the restoration of the judges
7349265 we willen voorzichtig de eredivisie in en veiligheid staat bovenaan
7349266 ask yourself if i only had 60 seconds on the stage what would i absolutely have to say to get my message across
7349267 not only are we the first to analyze these vision genes opsins in these early animals but because we dont find them in earlier evolving animals like sponges we can put a date on the evolution of light sensitivity in animals
7349268 we now have a time frame for the evolution of animal light sensitivity we know its precursors existed roughly 600 million years ago
7349269 our paper shows that such claims are simply wrong we show very clearly that specific mutational changes in a particular duplicated gene opsin allowed the new genes to interact with different proteins in new ways today these different interactions underlie the genetic machinery of vision which is different in various animal groups

7349273 what does the united states expected to gain out of this china junket
7349274 when we do business with a country we never go to war against it
7349275 ja vast die luie studenten denken dat ze het druk hebben kom maar terug als je echt wat doet
7349276 i cant say at all that we have confidence in israel
7349277 defensive weapons which are not breaking the regional balance of power
7349278 syrias bad negotiating position is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel
7349279 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7349280 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication
7349281 its easy and somebody could learn an entirely different language
7349282 left up could be turning lights on right down could be turning off the tv
7349283 i hope the same mask that protected me in beijing will help him protect his people
7349284 some italian athletes autonomously and without renouncing their commitment to sports made a symbolic gesture in favor of tibet and the dalai lama
7349285 in the field of great conquests for civil rights public opinion makes the difference and to move public opinion the gesture of an athlete is more important than the gesture
7349286 fighting is still going on we hit and destroyed over 40 militants bunkers and a training camp
7349287 we have confirmed reports that 50 militants were killed while 10 of our soldiers were martyred
7349288 rice smiled and if i remember correctly said she had had a chance to deal with georgia and its politicians but had not tasted its wine
7349289 they are scared of our peaceful but massive demonstrations for freedom
7349290 such repressive measures will not work we will emerge stronger and more vibrant
7349291 its basically turned it into a viable christmas or birthday present
7349292 i like to play because it teaches us discipline it teaches us to work with people older than us
7349293 its a positive physical activity rather than sitting in front of their xboxes
7349294 rather than sit there and pretend to be shooting people on a television theyre outside actually learning teamwork and how to react under stress
7349295 the guns look and function similarly to real firearms unfortunately in this society firearms have a bad reputation
7349296 if a police officer saw something that resembled a real firearm the best scenario is the gun would be taken away the worst scenario is the kid would get shot thats our nightmare
7349297 this is not just something you buy and let the kids go anywhere you cant go in the middle of the street with this stuff
7349298 no ones ever gotten shot so hard they got hurt
7349299 dang how could i have gotten that so wrong the guy is a stone cold trained political fighter and republicans are falling right and left
7349300 the real reason is secret service protection for my two girls as they enter into their teenaged years
7349301 whatever young guy comes by for a date were going to have one of these mean looking guys who dont crack a smile theyre armed theyre dangerous
7349302 require that 10 percent of our energy comes from renewable sources by the end of my first term more than double what we have now

7349312 catholics vote largely on a set of conservative values and on social values
7349313 on social values mccain has a natural advantage because of his pro life stance compared to obamas pro choice stance
7349314 look im a practicing catholic and it is the biggest dilemma for me in terms of comporting my religious and cultural views with my political responsibility
7349315 i am prepared to accept my churchs view i think its a tough one i have to accept that on faith
7349316 i strongly support roe v wade i wouldnt have a specific question but i would make sure that the people i sent to be nominated for the supreme court shared my values and understood that there is a right to privacy in the united states constitution
7349317 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7349318 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7349319 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7349320 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7349321 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7349322 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7349323 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7349324 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7349325 this decision reaches beyond the medical profession taking away the first amendment rights of healthcare professionals puts at risk the rights of every working american

7349330 is a direct result of of the ongoing cooperative efforts involving our office and law enforcement agencies in the united states
7349331 this man is supected of being involved in one of the most heinous mass killing in recent times
7349332 our goal is not only to see justice served but to protect law abiding citizens on both sides of the border from this type of senseless violence

7349358 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7349359 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7349360 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7349361 she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 percent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7349362 but obama felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7349363 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about childcare and figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7349364 hai orang orang yang beriman jika kamu menolong agama allah niscaya dia akan menolongmu dan meneguhkan kedudukanmu

7349366 perkara ini islam akan merebak di segenap penjuru yang ditembus malam dan siang allah tidak akan membiarkan satu rumah pun baik gedung maupun gubuk melainkan islam akan memasukinya sehingga dapat memuliakan agama yang mulia dan menghinakan agama yang hina yang dimuliakan adalah islam dan yang dihinakan adalah kekufuran

7349369 grassroots advocacy effort focused on educating consumers and businesses as well as members of congress and other policymakers on the failure of the wholesale electricity markets operated by regional transmission organizations rtos to adequately protect consumers
7349370 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7349371 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7349372 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences

7349375 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7349376 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7349377 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7349378 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7349379 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7349380 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7349381 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7349382 they say that our aggression our toughness came out of our slave situation
7349383 considering that jamaica had more slavery rebellion than any country in the world
7349384 its not a question of genetic pool but we have that
7349385 its a cultural thing too that we want to achieve
7349386 i think that he knows full well that his athletes have been using drugs
7349387 he set out to set up a lab to cheat they caught him he went to prison and now hes casting aspersions on other people who have stayed in this sport the last 40 years and have been clean
7349388 from 1948 until now we have been coming to the olympics in sprints ok and we have done well this is just a culmination of what has gone on for more than 40 years
7349389 which is difficult to translate exactly but could be said to mean though we may be small we are powerful beyond expectations
7349390 at the end of the day though there is a culture of track that the jamaicans have now mastered at a very high level
7349391 if usain bolt were born in north america or europe he would be now earning far more money as a professional basketball player with the odds of a much longer and more lucrative career
7349392 once upon a time they were saying we have it because we have fast fibers
7349393 so i said to them how many countries have fast fibers only a few areas in the world ah these are theories that dont hold strong when you have a complex situation
7349394 we passed exams at universities abroad because of the strength where other blacks failed
7349395 we feel because other people are now caught the playing field is now more level for us
7349396 all of them trained in the states and we caught them down in kingston
7349397 you remember that guy who believed in god so strongly
7349398 our athletes are strong believers in the almighty they believe that without the almighty they can do nothing and with the almighty they actually can do everything
7349399 we know that our athletes have trained hard that the country would not tolerate any kind of cheating because we are a moral christian country
7349400 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7349401 this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit pissed off
7349402 when that dreadful day comes the audience will be ready for it
7349403 the reason the finale of the last series worked so well is that it was top secret
7349404 it s a free country and people are entitled to say this is richard and judy going off into the dim antechamber of television but i would ask them whats the future digital or analogue of course we are going to get smaller audiences but this is the challenge of the moment
7349405 most people are desperate to be famous and would do anything
7349406 it appeals to the mentality of people who stop to watch after an accident
7349407 the wonderful thing about the olympics is seeing people become famous because they have talent what a lovely change
7349408 it is more fulfilling of course because it concerns talent the beatles didnt make it because of me but because of the songs they wrote
7349409 we have had a lot of complaints about the gassing of chicks from the germans this has gone all round the world and the one country that had a problem with it
7349410 i wanted to stand up and say hey after 65 years why do you need to bring that up it was a very unwise thing to say i was shocked
7349411 we work very closely with german tv and the german book publisher and we love all germans
7349412 i was driven to tell a certain kind of story about global consciousness and interconnectivity i asked can people with these powers find each other defeat evil and save the world it was important to have people in the show that werent just blonde haired blue eyed californians
7349413 our relationship with our audience is tenuous but they are passionate intense involved and yes obsessive
7349414 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7349415 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7349416 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7349417 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7349418 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7349419 a toyota four runner that was apparently travelling southbound in the 400 lanes coming back from up north and the vehicle apprently lost control it rolled through the center median and then flipped over top of the steel guard rail into the northbound lanes as a result we have two or three people who have been ejected
7349420 for everyone who poured their time energy and creativity into the making of this project i give my sincerest congratulations
7349421 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7349422 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7349423 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7349424 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7349425 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7349426 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7349427 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7349428 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7349429 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7349430 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7349431 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7349432 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7349433 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7349434 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7349435 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7349436 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7349437 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7349438 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7349439 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7349440 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7349441 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7349442 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7349443 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7349444 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7349445 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado

7349480 i was concerned beforehand because blackburn have a potent strike force and we had two young centre halves who are learning the game if you look at the game last week there were two experienced centre halves in evertons back four who were bullied to a certain extent by santa cruz and roberts that didnt happen today if anybody won the battle we did
7349481 we didnt attempt to shut up shop because i thought there was an opportunity to get three points
7349482 the players are enjoying the experience i just spoke to former everton manager joe royle and he said we played without fear
7349483 were delighted because hes a talisman for all of us
7349484 because i dont think we created enough chances and our team play was lacking a little bit of fluency we are not used to that
7349485 i feel the kind of mistake we made on the corner is not excusable you can be beaten on the ball in the air by somebody who jumps higher than you but you cannot concede a goal in the middle of the goal on the six yard line
7349486 we were too nervous when you are chasing the game in the last 25 minutes you have to be calm and we chose too many times individual solutions when the collective solution was there
7349487 i think the match on wednesday is already welcome because we already want to fight for that and win that and show our fans that what happened against fulham is just a mistake and we can keep on going we have something to prove
7349488 i think losing is going to be the best warning we can be given we cant think we are untouchable
7349489 i went through horrible times but now im playing im just enjoying every minute of it
7349490 i know how close i was to not playing again so every time i step on that pitch i just try and enjoy 90 minutes of football
7349491 at one point it was another op or hang up your boots time
7349492 i enjoyed it in moscow and i played in the champions league and spain was good too but when i heard that birmingham was interested it was the right way to go
7349493 we are looking strong and there is more to come
7349494 we have to stay strong mentally that is the key at the moment we are top but we are only getting started we can get better and better
7349495 it is frustrating because we are not getting ripped apart but we cant let this run continue
7349496 it is paramount that we get something on the board quickly the game against derby next week is massive
7349497 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7349498 the whole world is going to be watching and we will march with dignity and discipline today
7349499 now three years later our country is still mired in the middle east were talking about more war more cold war and pakistan
7349500 it was a pretty well behaved group and smaller than what we would have expected
7349501 im here to honor our son and the sacrifice he made for our country and to support the troops and the families who give so much

7349507 where jihadists operate with something close to impunity has become a al qaeda inspired tactics are already being deployed in and around kabul
7349508 join established jihadi groups in areas of weak government control such as afghanistan pakistan somalia yemen and lebanon
7349509 its only a prayer and we are all praying to the same god anyway right
7349510 we have an unbelievable team behind us management and technical
7349511 i know with confidence that when i step onto the track my bike will in absolutely perfect working order i cant remember the last time a mechanical problem was a factor in any gb races when i start a race it is a big boost mentally to have the certain knowledge that nobody lining up against me starts with an edge in fact it is always us who have the edge
7349512 if anyone in my back up team thinks they should be in front of him i dont want them
7349513 we are all here to back him up we are all behind him
7349514 itll be there forever because when it doesnt work out you take it personally
7349515 its taken a while to sink in and it bothers me in two ways one i liked him so much a great guy to be around and two that together we couldnt get it done couldnt figure it out
7349516 and matt took everything with such acceptance understood what we were doing
7349517 but when the juices got flowing he did what he was used to i cant blame him thats his competitive nature so when he needed to go back a bit he tried to go forward and i think that caused location problems
7349518 problem was hed look in at the batter and say to himself oh i can make this pitch because he had made it so many times in his career and always had success so his mind knew where the ball needed to go and how hard it needed to get there and what it needed to do but then when he pushed the button to do it it just didnt come out the way his mind had shaped the pitch
7349519 mostly his arm strength was gone and that affects everything velocity command the quickness of the break on your breaking balls
7349520 i knew the lack of success was beating him up pretty good but he still approached everything so enthusiastically even in his last start he went out there like it was his last start of the season and he was going after his 20th win
7349521 its the journey not the destination and what difference does it make anywhoo
7349522 well keep you here for a while and invest in you and you in turn will invest in us
7349523 if somebody wants to get better and i think i can help them then its a pleasure
7349524 i dont do it unless somebody asks me to do it and if i help them great if i dont i tell them its an experiment if it doesnt work for you forget it for it to work you have to be comfortable i dont have all the answers to anything
7349525 hes really about the only lefty i can talk to and go hey what am i doing and kind of have somebody who kind of connects with me when i pitch he knows what im about and he has a lot of good ideas a lot of things im able to do and a lot of things im not able to do he has a wealth of experience if you can tap in just a little bit its something you treasure
7349526 sandys words were the first words i heard in dodgertown
7349527 the things he talked about stuck in my mind about perseverance and following your dreams and dont let it go ever those things have stuck with me i like to spend time with him still
7349528 i never realized i was being compared to him hes such a big name such a dominant pitcher i never thought i could ever be a flash of what he is now after a few years people try to make comparisons to me there isnt my admiration doesnt even let me stand beside him any more than as a student to a teacher and thats what he is to me a teacher who you respect a lot and get along really well with
7349529 weve talked about replay for borderline calls safe and out home runs or non home runs for a number of years
7349530 the umpires particularly in a four man crew in many instances are 150 feet from the outfield fence where the ball crosses the line
7349531 mr protocol really likes treaties so we got him this treaty instead of a card so if you could just all the other countries have already signed it
7349532 and now if you could just initial here and here and here and oh you can ignore all that stuff about sulfides thats just an inside joke
7349533 did you hear the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla beaten senseless raped repeatedly and left to die
7349534 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7349535 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7349536 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
7349537 id rather slit a vein than vote for john mccain
7349538 the results and progress achieved in 2008 provide a good platform upon which to build
7349539 our shareholders have made it clear they want us to focus on maximising the performance of our existing assets and this is exactly what were doing
7349540 what would you say if we found a first class surgeon to take my place
7349541 id like for you to cancel your flight and come to the office tomorrow morning at 10 oclock
7349542 just be prepared to talk about the future direction of the franchise
7349543 when you left i went in to tell him i was going to step down and i recommended to him that you get the job
7349544 if you were to get the job what would you do
7349545 yeah yeah these are the drills ive been given im not going to mess with it ive seen something id like to try it but im not going to be the one to stray from the program
7349546 you know our general belief system you know what were about dont stray from that
7349547 what am i really doing to help us win every day
7349548 we care how are you doing how are the kids
7349549 kuehl is an odd bird hes a tough disciplined guy but hes extremely forward thinking open to new ideas and the implementation of new ideas
7349550 rick is an odd cat with new ideas when we hired rick we said lets take a shot and see what happens
7349551 its what i found out when i worked at major league baseball and i worked with the umpires who were unionized you can manage the union or you can manage the staff what i try to do is manage the staff because they are the ones doing the work
7349552 when i say manage the union im talking about the hierarchy the unions rules and issues you cant ignore those issues but what is your focus going to be the focus has got to be trying to get the best performance out of the group of 68 individuals who are unionized you have to take that into account and respect it but you cant forget thats not your primary purpose youve got to manage the staff to the benefit of the game the mission
7349553 how much actual not lip service importance does this manufacturer service provider vendor believe the customers have if they outsource the service to those customers
7349554 with so many of the initiatives and issues the all star games world baseball classic the olympics advertising on uniforms you have to balance baseball as entertainment against the experience as the entertainment
7349555 poverty remains the stubborn issue in our schools and community
7349556 as our community becomes more diverse the more it affects our ayp status
7349557 what heartens me was overall performance in red wing as a whole was up at a faster rate than the state average
7349558 the highs were no longer high enough and the lows were too low
7349559 the highs were no longer high enough and the lows were too low
7349560 ive daily challenged my players to give me the best that theyve got 100 percent of what theyve got that day physically and mentally and theyve done that without fail theyve done that
7349561 i have never had to work at getting that level myself ever until recently ive found that ive had to work harder in making that same commitment to my bosses to my players and to my coaches and thats not right
7349562 it is the price of progress that there never can be complete consensus all creative advances are essentially a departure from agreed upon ways of looking at things and to overemphasize the agreed upon is to further legitimize the hostility to that creativity upon which we all ultimately depend
7349563 this summer we see that rising food and energy costs are playing havoc with budgets both for families that were already struggling to make ends meet and for summer programs that are trying to serve hungry children
7349564 go for it go for it ill back you up
7349565 i grew up moving around a lot as i try to figure out what kind of impact that had on my life aside from the impact it may have had on personal relationships i think it makes people more adaptable
7349566 a willingness to embrace change not allowing yourself to be daunted by new circumstances the ability to create new relationships and operate in different environments and changing all that every two to four years
7349567 they were smaller clients who had more practical problems than they did theoretical ones i was less involved in corporate governance issues and more involved in how to make a safe pole vaulting pit i enjoyed a range of diverse clients i had some clients in agriculture a lot of things where you could kick the tires and be part of the business as well as provide legal advice
7349568 we had a small front office bigger than charlie finleys but not by much so while there was legal work there was a lot of baseball administrative work knowing all the rules i was involved in
7349569 being a general counsel wasnt a full time occupation i could go to modesto and watch minor league games do various things that would add to my baseball education
7349570 that means so much and that so many of that group are still there is very satisfying
7349571 in prior years there had been some effort to speed up games steve palermo a former umpire had been an advocate for speeding up games but as there are so many times in life ideas dont always get translated to action or implemented properly when they do
7349572 when i got to major league baseball frank robinson was in charge of time of game he had three or four guys who would go around talk to managers and pitching coaches and say hey hurry it up please do this or that
7349573 what i tried to do first was analyze the games themselves with the notion that if you can measure it you can improve it
7349574 we didnt have a complete picture of the components of the game and its components and identify areas which were inefficient
7349575 you can take all the actions in a game get starting and stopping times and determine where you have slippage
7349576 you can have it between innings there had been a lot of discussion about how we had more commercials than before and how that lengthened games
7349577 it wasnt the time of commercials it was the amount of time it was taking us to get out of the inning come back to commercials and then get back to the game we losing a minute or 45 seconds every half inning
7349578 sloppiness among broadcasters who wouldnt get out of their inning and into a commercial break fast enough to get back in time
7349579 thats one of the problems of the lack of collaboration between baseball and the broadcasters
7349580 but the game cant hit that exactly every time so we aimed to change it from about 3 15 for an inning break to something more like 2 45 if they sell 2 25 theyll never make it in and out but people get greedy we had one club that was selling its own ads and selling them right up to the edge
7349581 back when he played mike hargrove was known as the human rain delay but he took very little time compared to todays batters
7349582 trying to decide how to get something out by the end of the year
7349583 when you go to most chain restaurants ordering off the kids menu is a nightmare
7349584 right now kids meals are almost all unhealthy meals when they should be almost all healthy meals
7349585 at the very least restaurants should list calories on the menu so that parents can navigate through this minefield of calories and fat to find the healthy options
7349586 there have been a lot of changes to our restaurant menus especially childrens meals more and more options are available restaurants are offering low fat milk yogurt apples and vegetables as part of the childrens menu they are helping parents help their children make wise choices when they dine out
7349587 kids meals can be outrageously high in calories fat and sodium but its possible to go into just about any restaurant and cobble together a healthy meal for a child if the childrens menu doesnt look healthy you have to look elsewhere
7349588 eating out is no longer a special occasion its a lifestyle now so we have to be more selective about what we eat
7349589 this is a wakeup call that parents need to take advantage of restaurants healthier options especially if kids are going to be eating out three or more times a week
7349590 most kids dont clean their plates so they are probably not eating all these calories
7349591 poor pitching cost us a game in which we were leading 5 to 1 once again we failed to do things as they should be done in he big leagues
7349592 the homework on my book takes about two hours a morning
7349593 i purposely wait until the day after the game so i can review it objectively read the newspapers sportswriters often mention subtle points ive overlooked and have my wifes score card in front of me when the team is away from home isabel air mails me her score card or after a night game sends it special delivery to get it to me in time for my skull practice snip i summarize every inning each side got men on the bases and wind up with a series of general observations or memos to myself then i digest the whole thing with special attention to the memos to correct or confirm certain impressions ive frequently gone through the entire book to check up on some obscure but important angle
7349594 one of the stones in section 60 has sunk and a family member has requested that it be raised today
7349595 im the only really good centerfielder in the league right now
7349596 if youre ever on base against him this is worth knowing he plays shallow to cover for his arm which isnt very good
7349597 he might pull this ball you have to be ready to go either way you dont necessarily lean because what of the pitcher misses his spot
7349598 on the doorstep shot shows glavine slumping shoulders down exhaling apparently frustrated
7349599 we had two choices to try to do something or to do nothing
7349600 we had a set of standards it was a crime to let them sit on a shelf
7349601 of no value if your concern is security against insider threats
7349602 as just the epitome of how government money goes down a rat hole
7349603 were not going to sacrifice any of our stringent requirements to satisfy election administrators or manufacturers
7349604 i decided not to farm a few acres of land that ive farmed for i guess 25 years
7349605 they are the most prone to rocks washed onto it or flooded by the river i just cant bear to see it happen again
7349606 twelve inches of water falling on say this field of beets that were just starting to peak through the soil it just washed them away
7349607 unless we pay them more they cant afford to purchase that feed
7349608 i think the local food scene is in such its infancy right now that any outlet that does carry our produce has so many connections with california growers that they could easily make up for what we produce
7349609 the ultimate solution is we need to have good jobs
7349610 taste brings together people from all parts of the community to put on an event that doesnt just celebrate culinary talent
7349611 were really seeing a steady increase in the need so we appreciate this
7349612 we support the cause and we will continue to do it until the problem of child hunger is solved
7349613 if these conditions dont change i dont see any light
7349614 weve got to find a way to get through this
7349615 you just have to know how to use the whole bird
7349616 wow pasta is more expensive than i thought it was
7349617 were seeing less meat and more pizza sandwiches italian pasta and casserole type dishes
7349618 the real change that occurred in the last bout of inflation was that one of the cheapest meats became more popular chicken
7349619 people are going to grab chicken breasts because its easy a breast and a half is 8 this whole chicken is 6 50 you can use the bones for soup
7349620 the key is staying away from all processed foods even beans a bag of dry beans is cheaper than a can of beans
7349621 look how much time were spending if youre a working mom you dont have time to look around like this and you have to know how to cook and grow your own herbs
7349622 id rather have a nice italian cento brand but its going in a sauce so i dont think it needs to be great
7349623 that flexible piece of the budget is getting stretched more and more families rely on low cost high calorie low nutrition cheap foods
7349624 the face of hunger is not the extended bellies and wasted limbs that people often think about when they hear the words childhood hunger
7349625 its a different face something you might not recognize if you passed the child on the street
7349626 we hear stories from our partners across the state about whats happening
7349627 so a lot of kids are home alone home with older siblings home in the care of relatives
7349628 summertime as a time for kids to be going to camp or involved in sports is not the reality for low income families
7349629 for families having a hard time already buying fruits and vegetables 75 a week for camp on scholarship is just not on the family budget
7349630 when the doors to school close in the spring there is a lack of statewide programming for kids that is age appropriate cheap or free
7349631 libraries parks and recreation departments and churches are picking up the pieces
7349632 to ensure wherever theres a concentration of low income kids theres access to balanced nutrition from richford to barre to burlington it can be done
7349633 stigma is an issue its an issue with every nutrition assistance program
7349634 but a lot of kids just view summer food as one more element of a fun day its going to the pool and oh you get lunch too
7349635 brian j noggle apparently forgot that the proper design for a tin foil beanie calls for the shiny side out
7349636 im weeping openly right now thanks for hurting my feelings pinhead
7349637 the united way raises funds for 39 local community partner agencies many of which are not able to promote themselves
7349638 they are also involved in promoting volunteerism and education within the community with their various programs all funds raised by united way stay in our community and cover a range of areas such as children seniors and the homeless
7349639 workers will help with voter registration and handing out ballots overseeing the voting station and with the vote tally at the end of the night
7349640 remuneration ranges from 200 to 400 depending on the position
7349641 neither b c nor any individual health authority is alone in its challenge to recruit and retain the number of physicians required to meet the growing demand for medical care over the coming decades
7349642 because most physicians serving communities are private business people and do not work for ih recruitment was the responsibility of site level physicians alone however given recruitment challenges in todays market ih has developed a comprehensive approach to support communities in attracting physicians
7349643 research shows that more than 50 per cent of physicians would use the web to begin searching for new practice opportunities the new website ensures that the health authority is able to maximize web based marketing strategies in its efforts to address current physician supply challenges for communities throughout ih
7349644 it will take about three hours to do the repairs and during that time about 300 people will be without power
7349645 none of us really had an opportunity to build soap box racers as kids so we are doing it now
7349646 we are trying to make it as stable as possible so it wont tip over no matter how fast we go or what we may crash into thankfully the course is padded with hay bales
7349647 our whole theme is we want to make a penguin fly so if you can imagine a penguin on his stomach with his flippers out stretched and a cape around his neck trying desperately to fly thats what our box will look like
7349648 we still have to get the chassis figured out and get a good steering and brake system going before we build the frame then we will cover the frame with a mold exterior of a penguin hopefully once its all airbrushed itll look pretty good and will run well
7349649 registration runs from 9 a m to 10 30 a m our 3 km dog walk begins at 10 30 a m with our 1 km furry scurry following right on its tail at 11 a m
7349650 the merchant mall will give you an opportunity to shop with many products and services on display from local vendors as well as the spca store with many bcspca products for sale
7349651 it was getting strained before the recession and now it is broken
7349652 tuning an expensive server platform without addressing front end tuning issues is like racing a ferrari with flat tires dont let it happen to you
7349653 bufdiscard warning page xx dbid n bp 0xzzzzzzzz has stat0x10080 skipping
7349654 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7349655 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7349656 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7349657 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
7349658 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7349659 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7349660 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7349661 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
7349662 looking for the good of making these children accountable its for the concern of these children getting an education

7349674 my business is whats on top of the earth not beneath it
7349675 ive never done anything never seen anything i practiced for 20 years to be a man and then they killed me
7349676 the strike was necessary to get what we got in the deal vs what was on the table in october
7349677 yes but we dont live in a perfect world we had no alternative because we had gotten to the point where we werent negotiating all they were doing was saying no and we had to show them that we were serious about our intentions
7349678 we had a negotiating committee that was stocked with a lot of working writers and it looked as if the companies plan was to keep the tv season going right through the hiatus along with going ahead with a lot of movies
7349679 and at that point it looked like the dga and aftra would have been willing to go ahead and make a deal so had we extended we would have been out on strike with sag and there would have been plenty of stockpiled material
7349680 i got thrown into the deep end of the pool
7349681 when youre dealing with an asymmetrical organization like the amptp the element of surprise is enormously important we also had to deal with the realization that there was an enormous amount of stockpiling going on there were about 150 movies going into production and the networks were approving series without pilots so hindsight being 20 20 it was the right thing to do
7349682 i was surprised at how much of a surprise it was
7349683 because its very difficult to strategize with that many people involved and not have something get out
7349684 i do actually think it shortened the strike because the companies were not prepared for us going earlier
7349685 when we dropped dvds the idea was that we were showing that we were serious about making a deal because wed been told that the companies were too
7349686 i caught a fair amount of grief for that but it did show that the companies were not actually prepared to make a deal
7349687 it got pretty bleak during the holidays between christmas and new years
7349688 it was the first labor action about labor of the mind and i think that people were able to understand why that was important
7349689 actually whats happened since then has confirmed our beliefs that theres a huge amount of reuse and that were moving toward the convergence of broadcast online and cable and that there will be a multiplicity of platforms
7349690 as far as i can tell were seeing the same kind of trends as before declines in daytime and overall tv viewing
7349691 but were used to the situation being volatile because were freelancers and always looking for the next job so we expect there to be ups and downs were not seeing any drastic changes
7349692 youre always going to have writers out of work but the internet is now providing the basis for work
7349693 we are making deals every week on these thats sort of the silver lining on the cloud over the nation and the industry is somewhat recession proof and all signs point to sustaining a healthy industry
7349694 by my count thats about 20 pages to read and about 30 calls to make but after four days and counting mr ofarrell still hasnt uttered a word
7349695 hes either making no effort at all or simply misleading the public either way hes taking the community for granted
7349696 the greens felt very strongly that this will be a highly significant test of the opposition leaders environmental and economic credibility
7349697 his ability to resist lobbying from his friends in big business will be on trial
7349698 la celeridad es un principio que hay que respetar al m ximo pero tambi n la seguridad en la identificaci n de las v ctimas
7349699 tenemos que estar seguros de que lo que digamos a las familias es la verdad
7349700 and right in the middle of that is when david wrote psalm 51 so we dropped in psalm 51 to give you the reader the spiritual impact of that psalm
7349701 i do think you do lose something when you start demolishing any book of the bible
7349702 i dont want to collect him sic i want blood i have to make sure that it has to be done right because all my hits they are clean
7349703 i want to be proactive and personally take care to ensure that any security issue is promptly taken care of
7349704 the judge went ahead and granted their request so cps wasnt held to any sort of deadline or requirement
7349705 in a case with more than 140 mothers and 400 children all of whom have lawyers we maintain and hope to show at the hearing on sept 4 that formal discovery is virtually impossible
7349706 i can understand why his recognized descendants i e white descendants could have resistance to becoming involved in a kind of contentious debate
7349707 and i also understand they would want to protect his legacy his image throughout history
7349708 were neither sincere nor forthcoming in this effort so were not going to bother with them anymore
7349709 if bettye kearse were white and wealthy they would have no problem with this but shes not shes a prominent physician but she happens to be the wrong hue
7349710 the israeli institution is using the stick method instead of talking and convincing
7349711 one of the organizations financing this activity is the charity coalition which serves as the umbrella organization of extreme islamic funds worldwide operated by the hamas movement and thus the institution was declared an unlawful organization in 2002
7349712 theyre stirring up a little hate and discontent with that deal
7349713 its like putting up a barrier weve all intermingled for years
7349714 it was freer before but we live in a different world now
7349715 la capture dabou tiba et dabou ousmane limine deux des derniers chefs exp riment s du r seau aqi al qa da en irak
7349716 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7349717 but it is it is also true that god has given us each of us a free will and a responsibility to answer for our actions
7349718 i have set before you life and death therefore choose life
7349719 you could have endless debate over who went personal first but i think theres no question the mccain camp will use this as a justification to go after a lot of other things
7349720 the first presidential campaign that was really starting to be shaped by the world
7349721 thats sort of what the text message for the vice presidential pick was all about it didnt quite work thats also what the stadium event is all about their goal and well see what happens is to get everybody in there with their phone and send a text message to five more friends it becomes the most powerful organizing tool ever
7349722 the dj spooky thing was always meant to be a sense of humor
7349723 i never really was planning on to be a dj it was kind of meant to be an arts project
7349724 were both of a generational shift feeling comfortable as much in the normal art world as we are in the fine arts mixed with dj culture
7349725 we can see the convention and were shooting vibes over there
7349726 its not so out of the realm of consciousness that we could have an impact on the energy over there
7349727 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
7349728 we have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported
7349729 and we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we dont have to worry about
7349730 black youths within this country have been left to die and thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7349731 now were asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations
7349732 the government is committed to tackling gun gang and knife crime and getting weapons off our streets
7349733 the results and progress achieved in 2008 provide a good platform upon which to build
7349734 our shareholders have made it clear they want us to focus on maximising the performance of our existing assets and this is exactly what were doing

7349736 it is a very drinkable beer especially in the summer its one that people will try as opposed to the bigger bolder more challenging beers
7349737 real fruit is less consistent than extract with differences in sugar content and pectin levels and the fruit can clog hoses and equipment
7349738 with an extract customers will get the same thing every time they order it
7349739 in the mid 1990s everybody had a raspberry wheat beer
7349740 the popularity declined in the late 1990s and early 2000s then brewers started doing different things with the beers emulating traditional belgian fruit styles
7349741 that appeals to a younger crowd who dont drink stronger beers and want to enjoy something light and refreshing especially in the 21 to 27 age demographic
7349742 light refreshing fruit based beers are way hot for summer

7349773 i started work at h preston and son in whixall as a 15 year old brickie and i then had my own company when i was 17 i spent two years in the army in the artillery and then went back into the building trade to work for a couple of small firms i read in the whitchurch herald that a farm was for sale but i needed the other farm as well to make up 260 acres i thought i would like to have a go at creating a golf course because there was nothing like that in this area i should have stuck to the building trade because i was making money then
7349774 i bought both farms and then got planning permission for a golf course i approached peter alliss and david thomas who agreed to design the course ian woosnam worked here for a few years as a green keeper before he became a professional golfer and i have met some wonderful characters and players over the years we added a second 18 hole course and the courses have developed wonderfully over the years between the trees and lakes we are now regarded among the top ten courses in the uk and people are always asking me how hill valley began so i thought i would write it all down in a book after buying the two farms in 1972 for 280 000 hill valley was opened in 1975 by golf writer and commentator henry longhurst

7349784 in all the time that i volunteered there i saw one woman who showed signs of physical abuse

7349788 i on numerous occasions reported illegal drug use that i had witnessed take place on shelter property and often my complaints were ignored

7349831 credo sia corretto che una famiglia possa scegliere la scuola piu adatta al proprio figlio mettersi la casacca dello statale o del privato ci allontana dalla realta il ministro ha convenuto che ci sono famiglie che non possono permettersi di regalare ai figli una scuola privata e per questo che stiamo lavorando per migliorare la scuola pubblica incrementare le ore di insegnamento e organizzare dei corsi intensivi rivolti agli insegnanti del sud dove alcune scuole sono troppo al di sotto della qualit media italiana aumenteremo le ore degli insegnanti ha detto gelmini durante il dibattito pubblico svolto in serata ma anche giusto dar loro gli strumenti per svolgere il proprio ruolo e un riconoscimento sociale reinvestiremo i soldi recuperati dagli sprechi e dal taglio sulle spese per il personale premiando chi raggiunger i migliori risultati

7349853 were always looking for ways to improve rcr and feel strongly that this driver lineup will improve our company as a whole with our move to four teams next year

7349863 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7349864 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7349865 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7349866 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7349867 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq news and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7349868 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7349869 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old

7349918 there is concern at the very highest level that kate middleton still does not have a job
7349919 the queen is keen that the monarchy should lead by example and that the princes and their girlfriends should all be seen to be hard workers
7349920 the queen has made it known that she feels kate should get involved with a charity possibly an animal charity where she can be seen to be doing something proactive and something entirely safe
7349921 it is important that kate isnt seen to be doing anything controversial and she needs to do something completely different from any of the charity work that diana did
7349922 she has quite a bad reputation for being rude when it comes to responding to letters
7349923 she often fails to rsvp when she is asked to attend events she once failed to reply to a wedding invitation from one of williams friends and it didnt go down very well

7349939 fran ois bayrou est revenu sur sa proposition de supprimer lena
7349940 vieux serpent de mer sur lequel fran ois bayrou replace les projecteurs
7349941 lorsque les lites trahissent le peuple malgr la d mocratie le populisme nest plus p joratif mes yeux
7349942 lorsque les puissants font passer leurs int r ts de mani re hont e avant celui du peuple m me sils respectent formellement la d mocratie il est du r le l gitime des tribuns de le denon er au nom des sans voix
7349943 nous sommes un mouvement de r sistance de r sistance internationale applaudissements de r sistance naturellement ce nest pas le cas de notre pays ceux qui confisquent le pouvoir et lexercent de mani re arbitraire mais plus encore nous sommes un mouvement de r sistance lordre mondial lorsque celui ci est injuste nous sommes un mouvement de r sistance aux mod les qui essaient de semparer aujourdhui de la mondialisation
7349944 mais quand je constate la situation de notre r publique au jour daujourdhui je ne suis pas loin de penser que l ch ance de 2012 se gagnera sur un programme du type
7349945 je nen d mords pas il ne reste plus moyennant lapplication intransigeante de quelques principes minimaux fondamentaux qu se rassembler le plus largement possible autour des 2 ou 3 personnalit s politiques qui ont prouv leur courage et leur attachement au peuple et agir sans naivet et pour tre on ne peut plus clair au risque den faire hurler beaucoup je ne vois personne dautre que bayrou s gol ne et peut tre besancenot
7349946 moi qui pensais que le modem allait nous sortir de ces ternelles fi vres hexagonales gauche droite noir et blanc elles semblent au contraire sorienter vers un nouveau paroxysme

7349954 un homme qui na pas le minimum dhonn tet requise que cest de plus en plus dangereux et que cela devient le probl me num ro 1
7349955 en r alit cest simple je pense sinc rement que le pouvoir est exerc par un homme qui na pas le minimum dhonn tet requise que cest de plus en plus dangereux et que cela devient le probl me num ro 1
7349956 le citoyen doit tre la fois producteur et usager de la d mocratie
7349957 la langue est commune mais les formats du cv sont diff rents pas finalement une bonne chose contre luniformisation
7349958 une monarchie qui a mut en d mocratie sans vraiment faire une profonde analyse de ce quest la d mocratie
7349959 prendre aux riches et aux puissants pour donner aux d munis
7349960 en fait la france cest le pays de l peu pr s
7349961 la d mocratie est le pire des r gimes mais je nen connais pas de meilleur
7349962 je nai jamais crit quelque part que la france serait une dictature mais je maintiens quelle nest pas une vraie d mocratie
7349963 quil existe au dessus des luttes politiques un arbitre national charg dassurer le fonctionnement r gulier des institutions avant le droit de recourir au jugement du peuple souverain r pondant en cas dextr me p ril de lind pendance de lhonneur de lint grit de la france et du salut de la r publique
7349964 le pr sident de la r publique nest pas un arbitre au dessus des partis qui marche sur les eaux parce quil a t lu
7349965 la france cest le pays de l peu pr s
7349966 de gr ce ne refaisons pas le d bat sur le tce jai t trop morfondu par le tsunami dignorance de chauvinisme et de populisme qui a emport toute tentative de d battre s rieusement de la question
7349967 le probl me est quon a pas un mot pour d finir de fa on pertinente ce qui est
7349968 une mesure d mago et populiste serait de proposer de retirer leurs mandats apr s avertissement ceux qui cumuleraient trop dabsences au parlement
7349969 cette transparence permettrait au citoyen de demander des comptes ou des explications l lu
7349970 je ne vais pas troller ces commentaires en ouvrant un nouveau d bat je prendrai le temps un jour dune note sur mon blog
7349971 fran ois bayrou sest exprim de fa on admirable ce sujet en expliquant pourquoi il navait pas donn de consigne de vote concernant la r forme de la constitution
7349972 enfin permettez moi de me r server pour mon blog en ce qui concerne lexception dinconstitutionnalit
7349973 fran ois bayrou sest exprim de fa on admirable ce sujet en expliquant pourquoi il navait pas donn de consigne de vote concernant la r forme de la constitution
7349974 que ce plan ne soit pas fait seulement pour survivre mais ait aussi des objectifs enthousiasmants pour la france et leurope
7349975 encore faut t il que ceux qui ont le pouvoir soit solidaires de tous les autres fran ais
7349976 pour vous mettre sur la voie r forme des tribunaux de province
7349977 je dis bien que nous sommes dans une d rive de d mocratie repr sentative mais des d rives tol r es par ignorance ou manque de jugement par lensemble des citoyens non s paration des pouvoirs cumul des mandats humiliation continuelle du parlement etc lemp chent d tre effective
7349978 depuis dix sept ans ce p diatre effectue des tests sur des coliers g s de 5 6 ans depuis quelque temps il leur fait dessiner des bonshommes certains corps ont des bras des doigts des oreilles des pieds mais peter winterstein constate quun nombre croissant dentre eux sont d form s les bras partent des hanches et les jambes de la t te pour winterstein la principale cause de ces retards de d veloppement est la t l vision les personnages dessin s par les enfants qui regardent la t l vision moins dune heure par jour sont complets tandis que ceux des enfants qui regardent trop la t l vision plus de trois heures ne le sont que tr s rarement tous les enfants re us par peter winterstein allaient l cole maternelle depuis l ge de 3 ans pour valuer ces dessins peter winterstein et son coll gue robert j jungwirth ont labor un bar me de notation simplifi sur 13 points il sagissait avant tout de voir si le dessin tait complet pour chaque d tail comme les cheveux les yeux le nez le tronc ou les pieds les m decins ont attribu un point ils ont fait de m me pour la repr sentation des bras du corps et dune t te de taille proportionn e peter winterstein consid re que cette technique est particuli rement indiqu e pour comprendre comment les enfants pr scolaires per oivent les images les r sultats sont significatifs les enfants qui regardaient le moins la t l vision jusqu cinquante neuf minutes ont obtenu jusqu 10 4 sur 13 les enfants qui la regardaient plus de trois heures nont obtenu en moyenne que 6 4 sur 13 les plus mauvais r sultats soit 10 des dessins avec cette tude peter winterstein fait partie de ces m decins comme manfred spitzer neurophysiologiste et directeur m dical du centre hospitalier universitaire dulm qui ne cessent de mettre en garde les familles contre les cons quences de la t l vision chez les enfants spitzer explique quun cerveau ne simpr gne correctement des choses que sil les d couvre par le biais de plusieurs sens cest dire laudition la vue lodorat et le toucher et de ce point de vue la t l vision est selon lui une source dinformation bien pauvre en comparaison avec le monde r el de tels arguments sont aussi confort s par de nouvelles tudes am ricaines des tests comparatifs effectu s en trente ans sur des milliers denfants r sultats plus les sujets regardaient la t l vision enfants moins leur niveau d tudes tait lev 26 ans
7349979 bref ma conclusion est quil est une des premi res urgences pour notre pays de former des citoyens pour que notre soci t fonctionne d mocratiquement
7349980 cest donc le c ur m me de la pens e qui est ici atteint
7349981 jen parle r guli rement sur mon blog en tentant de rapprocher ses id es des enjeux que le modem pr tend adresser
7349982 ce que dit sylvie goulard para t tellement vident presque banal et pourtant on se croit vivre au royaume des t n bres
7349983 fran ois noublie jamais ceci je suis fid le mes ennemis
7349984 a charge pour nous de d montrer ult rieurement champomy que cette initiative citoyenne aura au final un petit impact
7349985 je ne connais pas am ou etes vous all chercher une telle id e
7349986 quimporte le score si ce sont les abeilles qui gagnent la fin
7349987 mais mon r ve ce serait plut t de faire des chansons la bob dylan
7349988 dailleurs la meilleure marque de lesprit cest de ne pas parler de soi et l je me sens
7349989 en tout cas je crois que le mien est le moins comment du lot
7349990 une semaine rien quune semaine durant beaux et c la fois

7349996 franchement article et commentaires se basant sur un vague sondage me paraissent une fois nest pas coutume bien tordus
7349997 or cest fran ois bayrou en france qui incarne d sormais cette fonction ce qui est un renversement sans pr c dent ce nest dailleurs pas un hasard si j f khan a parl un jour dextr me centre un langage de v rit peut donc porter aupr s de l lectorat du fn qui na cure lui aussi du clivage droite gauche sur le fond cet lectorat est un lectorat qui naspire qu revenir dans la sph re r publicaine mais qui veut simplement que lon soccupe de lui et quon le d fende contre les injustices
7349998 beaucoup dallemands qui navaient rien bouffer dans les ann es 30
7349999 d sormais cest l lectorat contestataire renvoyant dos dos les deux grands partis de gouvernement que sadresse fran ois bayrou dans la pr face du livre quil vient de publier 1 il d nonce ainsi les lites au nom du peuple des citoyens le tiers tat daujourdhui cest un peuple quils croient sans importance crit il presque un peuple de trop un peuple g nant ainsi le vivent les pouvoirs et le consid rent les puissants le m me mal ronge et court depuis des ann es pr parant chaque lection chaque consultation sa surprise lirruption du peuple indocile dans le concert bien ordonn de la pens e pr fabriqu e et chaque fois les puissants poussent des ah et des oh commandent des enqu tes dont ils d couvrent les conclusions navr es et retournent leurs habitudes m prisantes familier de la science politique un parlementaire europ en udf qualifie ce discours de centrisme tribunitien il nest du reste pas in dit en europe on peut citer par exemple le parti du travail en lituanie membre justement du parti d mocrate europ en copr sid par fran ois bayrou
