1570007 the average joe surgeon civilian or military has never seen this stuff
1570008 yeah theyve seen guys shot in the chest but the kind of ferocious blast burn and penetrating trauma thats part of the modern i e d wound is like nothing theyve seen even in a manhattan emergency room its a shocking heart stopping eye opening kind of thing and they need to see this on the plane before they get there because theres a learning curve to this

1570015 she couldnt pass a library even in a town she had never been in without getting emotional
1570016 the library in the days of mary jo hutchings was a major factor in the education of the young
1570017 in that sense she felt her responsibility was to make this reservoir of knowledge in mount prospect a place where young people especially would develop creative thinking
1570018 the greatest lesson she ever taught me was that to achieve happiness you have to look outward and serve other people
1570019 we will reach out to all the parties in parliament to find a genuine consensus on electoral law

1570032 they have 40 lanes and should be able to accommodate a lot of people we are expecting between 150 and 200 to come
1570033 i hope that corey would be happy with what we have been doing because everything we are funding were his favorite projects
1570034 i think it is apparent that the people who prepared this get an f
1570035 it validates the concerns we raised but it doesnt provide any viable solutions
1570036 to date the parties conducting todays hearing have not yet acknowledged the significant public benefits this transaction would provide to the regional economy and to dozens of chicago area communities that would see a reduction in freight traffic as a result of the transaction
1570037 the reality is that if this transaction were approved more than 60 communities would experience rail congestion relief roughly two times the number that would see increased rail traffic
1570038 the negative impacts that are measurable far outweigh the measurable benefits
1570039 approval of this rail sale will be totally life changing
1570040 if they want to operate on that line then they have the obligation to pay for the mitigation
1570041 thousands of people in towns that abut the existing cn lines stand to benefit from reductions in rail and highway congestion a decrease in train noise and relative improvements to safety
1570042 it would also set the stage for possible enhancements to metra service
1570043 the way to resolve the problem is not to shift the problem its is to not make it a problem for anyone
1570044 we need to take a step back and see how we want to move freight traffic through the region
1570045 our politics has gotten so ah nasty thats the word i was looking for
1570046 but not just nasty also cynical and manipulative right where we say things that we dont mean
1570047 so john mccain says barack would rather lose the war to win an election he just said something like that
1570048 you know despite the fact that if we had followed my recommendation not to go into the war in iraq we would have about an extra trillion dollars to rebuild our economy we would have been on the path of energy independence we would have finished the job in afghanistan and gone after al qaeda

1570058 democrats have a plan to lower gas prices taking america in a new direction that works for everyone not just the few our plan would empower the federal trade commission to crack down on price gouging to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices increase production of alternative fuels and rescind the billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies tax breaks and royalty relief given to big oil and gas companies
1570059 the energy crisis is a big concern blah blah blah we need to research alternate energy while working to bring gas prices down blah blah blah

1570086 she had been playing some of the clubs across the river in boston and of course her name was joan baez
1570087 and id been playing the guitar and really loved folk music so i started out as an audience member and eventually ended up performing there on a regular basis
1570088 its a little known fact bob dylan never had billing at club 47

1570090 if there was an omelet to be made i did it
1570091 if there were tickets at the door i did it if they needed somebody to sit in the art gallery in the afternoon and i could bring my kid and maria muldaur would bring her kid we called that working and then i sort of i guess graduated although that seems like a silly word i got to do scheduling
1570092 it was the most intense initiation into what was going on in this country at that time and how it had been expressed through music since the first people came over on the boats and the first slaves started working in the south
1570093 and one day she came in and she made an announcement
1570094 youve got to get these damn hippies out from in front of my property
1570095 they started doing jazz on the weekends and then suddenly all these little folksingers started calling them saying can i just slip on a friday night and do a couple songs
1570096 and they eventually started booking folk music in there again
1570097 well lookit here buddy you want to be like me pull out your six shooter and rob every bank you can see tell the judge i said it was all right

1570112 for all of their purported lofty goals the real purpose behind these types of laws is to punish unpopular beliefs and speech while raising the political standing of those groups granted special victimhood status under them
1570113 it isnt that i dont care anymore no it practically enrages me at times i just dont want the hassle of trying to explain to them what it could be like and even still it could even be worse for me i often dont question it i just accept life for what it is for me and make the most of it

1570215 john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1570216 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it

1570222 this is about beginning the grinding and painful process of rooting out this kind of hate language and behavior whenever and wherever it exists
1570223 the democratic leadership have pledged to unhinge our nation from gender bias hate language and misogyny and we are taking them at their word

1570236 i have not i can only be interested if john is
1570237 yep the way its looking we might actually win this thing
1570238 its not a question of who needs whom fact is the netroots are not going to be the decisive factor
1570239 but having said that were an activist set of people were engaged we give money we put boots on the ground thats why when many of us had a genuine disagreement with obama on fisa
1570240 folks in the convention have to keep in mind that not everyone who considers themselves a part of the netroots is here and many of them arent as concerned about say fisa or impeachment they want jobs
1570241 according to the storyline that drives many advocacy groups and democratic activists a storyline often reflected in comments on this blog we are up against a sharply partisan radically conservative take no prisoners republican party
1570242 changed the trajectory of america in a way that bill clinton did not
1570243 democracy cannot exist without strong differences and going forward some of you may decide that my fisa position is a deal breaker
1570244 think about it netroots was born at a time when the democrats were in opposition and its learning how to be a force of good when the democrats are in power and could have more power next year
1570245 crashing the gate netroots grassroots and the rise of people powered politics
1570246 for most everyone in the netroots the main goal right now is get obama elected period now how the netroots and obama move forward after november if he is elected is another issue
1570247 weve had some disagreements in the past and well have some disagreements in the future
1570248 i promise to continue to listen to your concerns take them seriously and discuss them respectfully
1570249 ive been waiting to see just how much hes going to involve the netroots in the way he thinks about policies
1570250 im not going to retract any of it every word i said was true
1570251 does not speak for me i speak for me i strongly disagree
1570252 the person here in michigan who just lost his job isnt suffering from a mental recession
1570253 i think senator gramm would be in serious consideration for ambassador to belarus although im not sure the citizens of minsk would welcome that
1570254 today i think we did come through a little bit
1570255 i was sitting there keeping the pitching chart like we always do before we pitch it caught me off guard
1570256 i didnt have much time to think about all the stuff going on i just tried to separate it and keep things as cool as possible i didnt think much of it
1570257 youre in a pennant race and sometimes things kind of boil up a little bit i just kind of ended up there
1570258 baseball is the only sport where you dont want to have the time of possession
1570259 he pitched a great game and kept us in the dugout
1570260 they were taking pitches and taking good swings i was in the same sequence on every batter hard soft hard soft that wont happen again
1570261 they hit some two strike pitches over the heart of the plate that usually are on the corners
1570262 i tried to let it out and it didnt cooperate so i had to back off a little bit i had been feeling great all week
1570263 hes just as quick as he was but hes knocked out several people since then
1570264 to come back with nothing thats not a good thing this time he has the experience
1570265 i was so young and people at that age do not usually get to the olympics which you expect can be a once in a lifetime thing i had the chance to maybe make it another time
1570266 so i set goals to fight twice as hard for the next olympics and be part of history by returning and winning
1570267 its in my blood and im going to do it as long as i can but after that i want to be ready for the rest of life
1570268 its a big sacrifice to leave home and leave your family
1570269 if you love the sport as much as we do youll do it its tough but youve got to stick it out theres a reward at the end
1570270 i would have felt bad if he did not win
1570271 i used to be mad im not mad any more i went through some ups and downs im lucky to be here

1570277 isso surpreendente dado que an lises anteriores da superf cie marciana foram consistentes mas n o conclusivas sobre a presen a de perclorato

1570281 the one thing i do have to say though about this issue is it is very important for us i think to deal with this problem in terms of thousands of hundreds of thousands of people coming over the borders on a regular basis if we want to also provide opportunity for the 12 million undocumented workers who are here senator clinton and i have both campaigned in places like iowa and ohio and my home state of illinois and i think that the american people want fairness want justice i think they recognize that the idea that youre going to deport 12 million people is ridiculous that were not going to be applause devoting all our law enforcement resources to sending people back but what they do also want is some order to the process
1570282 i dont know what his ambitions are but crawling around in this car i dont even know what its called he should not do that to himself
1570283 ive been saying to him for a long time that there are so many things in life you can do that are fun he could still deliver good results but at the moment he doesnt have the right options
1570284 its possible that today was my last drive in a formula
1570285 in any event the results are gory in the extreme as blood spurts from the severed arteries and veins of the neck including the aorta and the jugular vein

1570288 just thought we would spice things up a little bit today
1570289 well you know anytime a pilot says somethings not working the way its supposed to you make sure you tighten your seat belt
1570290 i want all of you to know in northern carolina we are going to be campaigning actively there
1570291 theres been a tradition of democrats conceding the state before the battle is even joined that is not what is going to be happening this time
1570292 when he was running for his partys nomination he walked away from that commitment
1570293 we will not succeed in the congress until we can convince the majority of the american people we have border security
1570294 its quite audacious for barack obama to question john mccains commitment to immigration reform when it was obama himself who worked to kill the senates bipartisan immigration reform compromise last year
1570295 designed by special interests to kill the immigration reform deal
1570296 are we going to declare our independence from special interests the oil companies and the gas companies that are preventing us from creating the kind of energy policy that will save our environment and free ourselves from dependence on foreign oil by investing on solar and wind and biodiesel thats the kind of independence we need to declare today
1570297 barack obama is proving himself to be a typical politician
1570298 its not clear why he would perform any better than any of the other democrats before him
1570299 people are sick and tired of the status quo here
1570300 theres a hurricane force out there in this country of people who say we want change
1570301 and if were not careful the democrats might have the kind of year we had in 1980
1570302 i congratulate president uribe the military the nation of colombia this is great news
1570303 all the other innocent people who are being held hostage
1570304 i would remind you that these things require incredibly long planning and coordination et cetera theres no way possible that it could have had anything to do with our visit that i could imagine its a very happy moment
1570305 i think the timing was fortuitous they just felt they had it ready to implement
1570306 i think it was a sign of confidence of president uribe and the defense minister in senator mccain and maybe in the two of us that they were prepared to share this information last night which was highly classified
1570307 protocol is not a word i would associate with this
1570308 i would leave the modalities to the government of colombia
1570309 but i intend to do everything i can do to support an increase in their capabilities
1570310 in his time on the national stage he has consistently put his party and his self interest first
1570311 we have seen barack obama forced to choose between principle and the interests of himself and his party he has always chosen the latter
1570312 its a statement of fact that he discards people and he discards positions when they become inconvenient for him
1570313 when politicians say one thing and then do another like senator obama has done voters wonder about the steadfastness of the character of the person sitting in the oval office
1570314 its our view thats exactly the politics that the american people are sick and tired of the only ideas they have to promote are the failed ones for the last eight years
1570315 the bottom line about barack obama whatever the position whether it be iraq campaign finance reform public financing hes going to take a tack that allows him to win he wants to win beyond anything else even more than keeping his word
1570316 either a tremendous success or a total disaster but no in between
1570317 personally im a lot more aware than i was in the past in the past i could have just done something and not really cared but now i think about the consequences like what happens to all the rivers and everything
1570318 we have asked to interview her twice and it has not happened

1570332 for those who oppose the death penalty and want to see it end our best bet is to vote for barack obama because his supporters have been working behind the scenes to end this practice dale leo bishop said
1570333 the clerk will not file a brief for an amicus curiae in support of or in opposition to a petition for rehearing
1570334 pursuant to rule 21 for leave to file this brief as amicus curiae in support of rehearing
1570335 rehearing is warranted to ensure that a material omission in the decisionmaking process has not tainted the court s decision on a matter of such profound institutional moral and practical importance
1570336 in reality the militia clause was a means to encourage ratification by the anti federalists who were fearful of both standing armies and an armed subset of the militia which might have been equivalent to a standing army by guaranteeing that all individuals not just those in militia service would have the right to keep and bear arms the federalists assuaged that fear
1570337 the petition clause secures a right of meaningful access to whatever avenues remain and the due process clause confers a procedural right of access to evidence for dna testing if the testing can be accomplished at little cost and exculpatory results would undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial
1570338 only while under oath and subject to cross examination by the prosecutor

1570343 if anyone were curious how someone who worked for the dukakis campaign and has never voted republican could have left the democratic party behind as it turned into a morass of the same fear mongering and hate filled politics that the republican party has been guilty of in the past this shining example is a good place to start

1570354 we have had instances in the entertainment industry of celebrities using these spats for publicity
1570355 these star quarrels always manage to capture public attention and put the stars in the spotlight
1570356 often stars go for indirect or negative publicity for themselves or their movies as long as that purpose is served the negative connotations doesnt matter
1570357 although these celeb spats have become a common phenomenon its also true that often the media spices them up and blows things out of proportion
1570358 we do have spats in the industry but i dont feel big stars like salman and shah rukh need any kind of publicity the media sometimes just goes by the rumour and presents things that arent really true
1570359 it is sad that the media exaggerates and turns minor disagreements into full blown fights
1570360 they never write the exact thing that celebs say it is true that some celebrities feel that any publicity is good publicity and some of them do go for indirect publicity but im totally against that
1570361 the thing i always say is control all the variables you can control dont worry about the rest
1570362 theres a little prayer they give to the druggies and alcoholics god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change courage to change the things i can and wisdom to know the difference yeah i live by that

1570385 when i say that the revelation of god in jesus christ is against morality i am not trying to say that it replaces one form of morality with another revelation is an attack on all morality as is wonderfully shown by the parables of the kingdom of heaven that of the prodigal son that of the talents that of the eleventh hour laborers that of the unfaithful steward and many others in all the parables the person who serves as an example has not lived a moral life the one who is rejected is the one who has lived a moral life naturally this does not mean that we are counseled to become robbers murderers adulterers etc on the contrary the behavior to which we are summoned surpasses morality all morality which is shown to be an obstacle to encounter with god

1570391 obama himself voted for a 2005 energy bill backed by bush that included billions in subsidies for oil and natural gas production a measure cheney played a major role in developing mccain opposed the bill on grounds it included billions in unnecessary tax breaks for the oil industry
1570392 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that they re talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you d actually save just as much

1570399 the car inflating idea is stupid most cars mileage dont have anything to do with tire inflation if i inflate my tires will gas go down to 2 bucks a gallon i think not
1570400 when it comes to ignorance and pride were the best
1570401 if republicans are so ignorant then why are they the ones with high paying jobs and pay the highest taxes that support all the social programs that benefit the democrats who are too lazy or ignorant to go out and earn a living
1570402 if republicans are so ignorant then why are they the ones with high paying jobs and pay the highest taxes that support all the social programs that benefit the democrats who are too lazy or ignorant to go out and earn a living
1570403 better to remain silent and thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt

1570440 you know i have to admit if i hadnt been barred from entering the country i might find myself hedging my own opinions about china just so as not to anger the chinese government
1570441 oh and by the way its irrelevant that i work for stonebridge people ought to know that
1570442 well its because you know were brookings and we want more credit for brookings
1570443 im for engagement when people like henry kissinger talk about engagement they mean black tie affairs with top government and business leaders but those leaders are not the same as the chinese people
1570444 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george coming back tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationary and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals saying you may not like this but here is our next mission and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish ultimately people even talked about it after the fact it was a dark day for the cia it was the kind of thing where they said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forward a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1570445 if i am president i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector working with state and local governments to achieve a single overarching goal in ten years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela
1570446 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it does include a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution what ive said is im willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1570447 i call on senator obama to call on congress to come back into town and come back to work come off their recess come off their vacation and address this energy challenge to america and dont leave until we do republican and democrat joining together and a very vital part of that is nuclear power and another vital part of that is offshore drilling we have to drill here and drill now
1570448 im not satisfied in part because i think they havent been as forthcoming not only with me but with the american people about the status of this investigation i also havent seen the evidence and i think that given their checkered past and the difficulty that they had in getting to this point the bungling of the hatfill part of the investigation leads me to be very skeptical
1570449 we oppose the visit by bush who sells us beef with its risk of mad cow disease that threatens the health and lives of the public

1570453 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1570454 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
1570455 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1570456 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
1570457 when i envision the future of robots i always think of the jetsons
1570458 george jetson never sat down at a computer to task rosie to clean the house
1570459 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us
1570460 but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention
1570461 the goal of the assessment should guide the choice of the assessment tools used and assessments that will have widespread effects should meet high standards of rigor and validity
1570462 for example using a standardized test with a sample of children in a program would be suitable if the goal was to determine whether the program is bringing children closer to national norms but if the purpose is to guide instruction within a specific classroom a nonstandardized assessment linked to the curriculum would be appropriate
1570463 we will be directly recruiting about 60 per cent of field staff mainly at the level of police sub inspectors for intelligence gathering through state recruitment board

1570473 with the delta announcement you really hit the tipping point
1570474 but you do not want to get on the plane and decide thats where youre going to download the digital version of gone with the wind

1570480 it wasnt extraordinarily fast but it was quite adequate and it was a good service
1570481 we are so connected between blackberries and everything else that anxiety sets in for a lot of people
1570482 theyre afraid not to be connected theyre afraid of what they might miss for an hour an hour and a half im fine two or three hours i dont know
1570483 we will directly recruit about 60 per cent of field staff mainly at the level of police sub inspectors for intelligence gathering through state recruitment board
1570484 the direct recruitment for intelligence operations means these staff will be deputed for intelligence gathering only they cannot be transfered for policing duty
1570485 we have to device a foolproof recruitment procedure for selection of people to create a first of its kind intelligence cadre in the state

1570495 tomorrow you will take your role with us in our operation to attack al qaeda militants
1570496 we intentionally allowed them the militants to flee in order to create a gap between their leaders and followers from the chaos
1570497 when they get back again they will find no ground for them to work as we will have changed the area with this operation

1570500 the rising price of oil has brought hardship to our country
1570501 because the price of oil is too high the supply of oil is too uncertain and we depend on oil too much
1570502 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise
1570503 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
1570504 the world oil market like the world ocean is one great pool the price is the same at every border who exports the oil americans consume is irrelevant

1570516 where the film struggles a bit is in the end when it obsessively goes around and wraps up every loose end including minor ones where the audiences guess at how it would end was probably adequate the consequence of this is that the film wears out its welcome going on for at least 15 minutes more than it needs to
1570517 you think the first movie was too long ill show you too long

1570537 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games
1570538 the olympic games represent something powerful that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible however the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur
1570539 i still remain convinced of the great role the olympics can play as a force for promoting peace around the world including in the still raging crisis in darfur
1570540 yet despite the fact that ive always spoken positively of the olympic ideal and never called for a boycott or asked an athlete to break an ioc rule my visa was revoked less than 24 hours before my scheduled departure

1570552 im somewhat pleased that the number of building permits is down but weve got a real problem in certain pockets of the community where the empty houses are leaving a bad impression of the neighborhood
1570553 those areas were hot and had the most transactions there were lots and lots of mortgages taken out

1570570 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals

1570592 unless theres a budget in the next few days were facing crucial actions the state is going to have to take
1570593 we must reject irresponsible tax increase proposals like raising the sales tax because they will do nothing but hurt families kill jobs and delay our economic recovery
1570594 the only proposal democrats are willing to discuss is one that includes tax increases
1570595 this economy will not survive more taxes it is a nonstarter for us
1570596 unless he can get republicans to agree with his point of view we could be here for an extended period of time
1570597 i dont think we can get a budget this year without budget reform
1570598 have a huge list of ems but they have not brought anything up
1570599 they never once proposed any alternative to the democratic budget so the burden is really now on them if they want to let the great state of california slide into arkansas thats going to be on them

1570603 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law

1570605 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
1570606 because different types of perchlorate salts have interesting properties that may bear on the way things work on mars if and thats a big if the results from our two teaspoons of soil are representative of all of mars or at least a significant portion of the planet
1570607 the phoenix project has decided to take an unusual step
1570608 we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains of mars
1570609 right now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
1570610 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas we may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt that doesnt release chlorine gas upon heating
1570611 theres nothing in the tega data that contradicts mecas finding of perchlorates

1570638 mr costello has made not one valuable structure change in the australian economy in the 12 years he was treasurer
1570639 hes a guy without imagination and he is a guy without courage
1570640 that point was proven by the fact he let former prime minister john howard stay there for so long
1570641 its a liberal party so bereft of talent that they have go to such a low grade performer as costello to come back as their leader he is a slow acting dope
1570642 in national terms to have such a nong and he is in policy terms he is a mouse to have him back again speaks volumes about the liberal party

1570885 whether the victim is victimized because they are of a certain race religion sexual orientation it is a crime and in weld county and in greeley were going to do the very best we can to enforce the law
1570886 a prosecutor is going to talk about this being a knowing killing that the defendant knew what he was doing the defense is going to argue that it was the heat of passion that he did it because he the defendant was so upset for being duped
1570887 this is not a classic hate crime where an individual is beaten to death because of their orientation this is a case when an individual reacted irrationally and unlawfully to learning they had been fooled
1570888 if you are not there to help me i would rather die
1570889 why shes neither fish nor flesh a man knows not where to have her

1570891 cannot themselves go to market and perform exchanges in their own right
1570892 why should i try to outsing saigal let him remain enshrined in our memory let his songs remain just his songs let not even one person say that kishore kumar sang them better
1570893 i was the biggest draw after dilip kumar there were so many films i was doing in those days that i had to run from one set to the other changing on the way imagine me my shirts flying off my trousers falling off my wig coming off while im running from one set to the other very often i would mix up my lines and look angry in a romantic scene or romantic in the midst of a fierce battle it was terrible and i hated it it evoked nightmares of school directors were like schoolteachers do this do that dont do this dont do that i dreaded it thats why i would often escape
1570894 look i dont smoke drink or socialise i never go to parties if that makes me a loner fine i am happy this way i go to work and i come back straight home to watch my horror movies play with my spooks talk to my trees sing in this avaricious world every creative person is bound to be lonely how can you deny me that right
1570895 people bore me film people particularly bore me i prefer talking to my trees
1570896 there was this interior decorator a suited booted fellow who came to see me in a three piece woollen saville row suit in the thick of summer and began to lecture me about aesthetics design visual sense and all that after listening to him for about half an hour and trying to figure out what he was saying through his peculiar american accent i told him that i wanted something very simple for my living room just water several feet deep and little boats floating around instead of large sofas i told him that the centre piece should be anchored down so that the tea service could be placed on it and all of us could row up to it in our boats and take sips from our cups but the boats should be properly balanced i said otherwise we might whizz past each other and conversation would be difficult he looked a bit alarmed but that alarm gave way to sheer horror when i began to describe the wall decor i told him that i wanted live crows hanging from the walls instead of paintings since i liked nature so much and instead of fans we could have monkeys farting from the ceiling thats when he slowly backed out from the room with a strange look in his eyes the last i saw of him was him running out of the front gate at a pace that would have put an electric train to shame whats crazy about having a living room like that you tell me if he can wear a woollen three piece suit in the height of summer why cant i hang live crows on my walls
1570897 i play different roles at different times for different people in this crazy world only the truly sane man appears to be mad look at me do you think im mad do you think i can be manipulative
1570898 good business rats one can make money from them if one is enterprising
1570899 i was shooting in the south once i think the film was miss mary and these chaps kept me waiting in the hotel room for five days without shooting so i got fed up and started cutting my hair first i chopped off some hair from the right side of my head and then to balance it i chopped off some from the left by mistake i overdid it so i cut off some more from the right again i overdid it so i had to cut from the left again this went on till i had virtually no hair left and thats when the call came from the sets when i turned up the way i was they all collapsed thats how rumours reached bombay they said i had gone cuckoo i didnt know i returned and found everyone wishing me from long distance and keeping a safe distance of 10 feet while talking even those chaps who would come and embrace me waved out from a distance and said hi then someone asked me a little hesitantly how i was feeling i said fine i spoke a little abruptly perhaps suddenly i found him turning around and running far far away from me
1570900 leena is a very different kind of person she too is an actress like all of them but shes very different shes seen tragedy shes faced grief when your husband is shot dead you change you understand life you realize the ephemeral quality of all things
1570901 im mad true but only about one thing horror movies i love spooks they are a friendly fearsome lot very nice people actually if you get to know them not like these industry chaps out here do you know any spooks
1570902 if you think about it the crocs company should really be admired p t barnum would be proud theyve managed to separate money from the wallets of millions and millions of seemingly sane people who wake up look in the closet and actually decide today ill leave the house wearing these neon green dutch bubble shoes with swiss cheese holes in them maybe ill even buy some little plastic strawberries or bananas and jam them in the sweat holes just to jazz things up and make the bacteria incubate faster thats fine i say do whatever you want in the privacy of your own home let your crocs freak flag fly but dont make the rest of us watch

1570938 although i originally had the music industry in mind when i developed drank i realized there was a real need across the board for a product that could relax and refresh naturally
1570939 our first quarter results included more than 4 million of revenue associated with the seven ondemand machines that were accepted by omnicare
1570940 we have begun to evaluate our business in three segments and therefore examine the financial results of each segment separately
1570941 we are currently addressing several issues that have affected the operating margins in our consumables segment and believe that we are implementing plans that will mitigate the impact
1570942 while we are pleased with the improvement in our packaging automation operating results we continue to keep the sales organization focused on building a backlog of machine sales with appropriate margins
1570943 we expect improvement in our medication administration segment as we approach the latter part of this fiscal year
1570944 fiscal 2009 will continue to be a challenging year for mts as we complete our commitments with the omnicare contract expand our penetration of european markets and make further progress with our initiatives in the retail market and development of our medtimes product
1570945 our excellent second quarter results continue our track record of strong growth and delivering on our commitments given our results to date and our expectations for the remainder of the year we are increasing our full year revenue guidance and our guidance on adjusted income from operations margin we expect revenues for the full year to grow organically by 26 28 from 823 million in 2007 as a result of increased internal efficiencies a shift towards higher value work and improved pricing for the value we deliver we now expect our adjusted income from operations margin to improve by 80 to 100 basis points to between 17 1 and 17 3 in 2008 from 16 3 in 2007 genpacts six sigma process and technology expertise are driving market penetration and sustainable superior growth as we create value for our clients and all our key stakeholders
1570946 we were pleased overall by our operating results in the second quarter segment earnings in our annuities stable value and acquisitions lines were in line with or above our expectations for the quarter while our life marketing segment was slightly below our expectations for the quarter after adjusting for less than expected favorable mortality results were essentially in line with our plan earnings in asset protection were below plan due to the impact of the sharp decline in u s auto and marine sales in the quarter and certain legal expenses and settlements that were above plan levels in the corporate amp other line we were also pleased by the recovery we experienced in our securities trading account in the quarter at the same time we were disappointed by the fact that net income was negatively impacted by impairment charges on a portfolio of alt a category securities we purchased in 2007 notwithstanding these charges our investment portfolios performed well in a difficult credit environment as we continue to enjoy higher yields and wider spreads on our investments we were especially pleased by the solid credit performance we continued to experience in our commercial mortgage portfolio problem mortgage loans remain at historically low levels as we look to the second half of the year we expect credit market conditions to remain challenging nevertheless we are maintaining our disciplined approach to investment management and we are optimistic that our securities and commercial mortgage loan portfolio will hold up well in the circumstances we are not however optimistic about participating mortgage income over the remainder of the year the absence of liquidity in the real estate sector is having a significant impact on sales activity in the participating loan portfolio while we do see increasing opportunities to originate attractive participating loans we do expect low levels of participating mortgage income for the remainder of the year we remain encouraged by our prospects in our retail marketing businesses we expect to have a record level of sales in our annuities line and continued positive fund flows in most product lines while life sales were somewhat below plan in the first half of the year due in part to the late introduction of a new series of universal life products our expectation is that sales activity will pick up in the second half as these and other new products are introduced to the market overall we think we are well positioned in the annuities and life marketing lines for solid performance while asset protection is likely to remain under some sales and earnings pressure so long as auto and marine sales are depressed we expect continued good performance from our in force service contract business overall we believe that our fundamentals remain solid notwithstanding the challenges presented by the current macroeconomic environment and we remain positive in our longer term outlook and expectations for our business
1570947 a dcf valuation of nike yields a price of 68 while its current price is 57 24 undervalued by 19
1570948 given the brutal commodity and consumer environment our second quarter comps were very encouraging and our earnings and cash flow yield remained strong
1570949 that 600 million is kind of one for the ages its held for 10 years
1570950 its very very difficult to get from 500 million to 600 million but the fact were even talking about it tells you something about the strength of the dark knight and what a phenomenon it is

1570956 despite softening industry wide demand our hotels are benefiting from our comprehensive renovation program and continue to increase revpar well above the industry more importantly our portfolio gained significant market share from its competitive sets and we remain on track to earn our targeted returns from completed renovations
1570957 we will continue to focus on driving market share and still anticipate that revpar for our portfolio will increase significantly higher than the industry average for the remainder of the year and into 2009
1570958 we are very pleased with what we accomplished during the second quarter including gains in market share and managing flow through by reducing costs across the portfolio we expect that we will continue to outperform the industry in both revpar and margin growth
1570959 there is no denying the current economic trends and potential for further deterioration in demand demand is being impacted by reductions in airline capacity higher fuel costs moderating gdp and negative sentiment towards the economy as a result we have revised our outlook for the remainder of the year and have taken a more conservative stance regarding our dividend distribution
1570960 the quality of encore is shining through with record revenues and ebitdax from our properties
1570961 we are pleased to see improving results from our two largest areas of capital deployment the bakken sanish in the williston basin and the west texas jv in the permian basin these areas were already working well but now they are even better we previously announced the charlson 11 16h sanish well which ipd at 1 100 boe d and averaged 843 boe d over the first seven days we are continuing to drill in the charlson field and plan on completing our next well there in early september in our west texas jv with exxonmobil we are proud to announce the pyote gas unit 3 3h in which we have a 30 percent working interest and a 22 5 percent net revenue interest this well is testing from the montoya formation at a current rate of 12 7 mmcfe d we have drilled a lot of wells in the past ten years and this well has the largest ip of any that we have ever drilled at encore this pyote well was a commitment well in the west texas jv and confirms over 20 montoya locations in block 16 we believe we can exploit waha and coyanosa in a similar fashion both of which are west texas montoya fields in the delaware basin an area that should not be overlooked is the brown bassett field in the west texas jv we have uncovered devonian horizontal production in this field we have tested the bassett goode 7h and the banner estate 49h at 4 5 mmcfe d and 3 4 mmcfe d the potential here is vast because these are the first devonian producers in this huge old field the midland basin continues to deliver we increased our production volumes from the midland basin to 5 8 mmcfe d in the quarter despite a pipeline curtailment that negatively affected our midland basin production by 1 2 mmcfe d
1570962 we have been studying strategic alternatives at encore that would bring the most value to our shareholders the board and management have decided that a sale or merger of the company is not currently in the best interest of our shareholders the energy and credit markets became very indecisive during the second quarter due to timely acquisitions a put based hedging strategy and our financial flexibility encore acquisition company has always excelled in times of market indecisiveness
1570963 the plan going forward is simple achievable and will add value for our shareholders the plan is to divest of non core properties drop down properties into encore energy partners and purchase puts struck at 110 per barrel for calendar year 2009 we expect the divestment of the non core properties and the drop down will pay off most or all of our bank debt and the puts will ensure that we have good cash flow in 2009 the main advantages of this strategy will be to situate encore for a larger drilling program in 2009 and to increase our acquisition capabilities for long life properties in our core areas we will be focusing on increasing our drilling program in our 240 000 acre bakken sanish play from two rigs currently to six rigs by the middle of 2009 exploiting the high rate of return development wells in our west texas jv and drilling our growing haynesville lower cotton valley and bossier potential in north louisiana and east texas to increase our focus on our tertiary opportunities encore previously moved tom olle into the position of vice president of strategic solutions to focus on procuring co2 opportunities for our 200 million barrels of reserve potential these opportunities will sustain growth over the next ten to fifteen years
1570964 encore acquisition companys board believes that this was a worthy task to explore all of our strategic alternatives and we believe we have chosen the alternative that will add the most value to our shareholders this would not be possible without our great employees who have displayed the utmost patience and loyalty to encore after implementing our plan encore will have more growth and a tighter focus that will lead to better and better operating results we appreciate our shareholders our board and our employees we are poised to grow in 2009 and many years to come

1570970 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1570971 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1570972 the era of u s funded major infrastructure projects is over
1570973 accurately highlights that iraqs revenues have grown substantially in recent years
1570974 still needs to improve the speed and effectiveness of its budget execution and the transparency of its budgeting and accounting practices
1570975 we estimate that the iraqi government could spend between 35 3 billion and 35 9 billion of its overall 49 9 billion budget

1570978 and i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1570979 im paris hilton and i approve this message because i think its totally hot
1570980 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling in reality paris hilton may have a more substantive energy policy than barack obama
1570981 oh if i dont tell them this they wont believe me
1570982 hitler wasnt a monster he was human and thats whats really scary
1570983 no hitler wasnt a monster he was human and thats whats really scary
1570984 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1570985 but not only has mccain not peddled any of it hes condemned it
1570986 to my knowledge senator mccain has never mentioned senator obamas race much less in the tone senator obama implied
1570987 effectively assured that race would once again become an unavoidable issue
1570988 i advised jesse helms to do what hes always done

1571003 you can feel very comfortable even in conducting diplomacy i think this is good
1571004 i sincerely hope that all of our united nations staff agencies and funds and programs and hopefully member states will also participate in this important initiative
1571005 the cool un initiative was inspired by many factors including government program such as
1571006 i dont think we want to get involved in the fashion police business of determining exactly what people can wear but i think the encouragement of being business casual would be probably where we are going
1571007 we can at least save 300 tons of greenhouse gas emissions we can also conserve energy by 10 percent
1571008 this is for the convenience and comfort of delegations who will have to engage in very important negotiations and debates on world affairs

1571011 this is another example of unrealistic cost estimates for government projects senator mccain will demand that government estimates reflect the real costs of projects
1571012 its a lot of money but i would argue pretty strenuously the cost of doing nothing is a lot higher
1571013 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1571014 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working
1571015 this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar

1571020 you kind of know what makes you win and what makes you lose and what makes us win is our pitching and our defense and then we have timely hitting tonight we got the hits when we needed it
1571021 it just didnt want to work the way i was seeing it in my minds eye
1571022 but it rarely does so we just had to make the adjustments on the fly and our guys did a great job
1571023 a lot of want to we wanted to win that game somehow we did because these guys have really pressed us hard so i was really pleased with the effort of our players tonight
1571024 every win is huge and we need it over the course of the season
1571025 in our minds to get to 90 something wins you got to win now as much as you can every day
1571026 all ive got to do is just learn it right now
1571027 at michigan it was man or zone thats all you needed to know now you need to know what the backside corners are doing what the water boy is doing and everybody else
1571028 youve got to look at dbs and middle linebackers youve got to look at the whole defense
1571029 the routes depend on what the coverage is you come out and you know what youve got to do but it may change the whole thing after you get done looking at the coverage

1571042 when people engage in this type of behavior they dont realize that it ties up valuable police resources and that sometimes inhibits our ability to respond to genuine community concerns
1571043 this one happened out in the coffee road area and couldve easily happened in the downtown area but no theyre not targeting any specific sector of people or the population
1571044 i know how much the auto industry and the autoworkers of this state have struggled over the last decade or so
1571045 but i also know where i want the fuel efficient cars of tomorrow to be built not in japan not in china but right here in the united states of america right here in the state of michigan
1571046 it seems like the oil companies are price fixing to avoid national competition and they shouldnt
1571047 that shows how out of touch he is with michigan voters
1571048 hes pandering to san francisco liberals and environmentalists who would just as soon we not have cars
1571049 the market will spur the drive to more fuel efficient cars
1571050 rather than being dominated by rural farmers tropical deforestation is increasingly driven by major industries especially large scale farming mining and logging
1571051 although this trend is pretty scary its also much easier to target a handful of global corporations than many millions of poor farmers
1571052 green groups are learning to use public boycotts and embarrassment to target the corporate bad guys
1571053 and it already seeing the global soy palm oil and timber industries beginning to change their approach theyre realizing they cant run roughshod over the just too risky for them
1571054 in addition some massive financial firms including goldman sachs jp morgan chase citigroup and bank of america have altered their lending practices after coming under fire from environmentalists
1571055 many multinational corporations are developing greener products because theyre more profitable for example the market for eco friendly timber products is expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars in the u s by 2010
1571056 we argue that the public and green groups need to send a loud clear message to the corporate sector
1571057 every tree that grows is taking a substantial amount out of the atmosphere
1571058 our biggest concern is that agriculture will be put back on the backburner where its been for some years and not be given full consideration which will cost it in the longer term

1571078 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1571079 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working
1571080 this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar
1571081 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
1571082 we hope that these results will speed up the classification of the ntokou pikounda zone into a protected area
1571083 we hope that the results of this survey will allow us to work with the congolese government to establish and protect the new ntokou pikounda protected area
1571084 since it preserves the amazon and the pantanal clearly defining where it can be planted in the latter region and without cutting existing production it seems to me that the agreement is good for everyone
1571085 to become successful in the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry addressing technology issues jointly rather than independently reduces the risk by leveraging the best of both companies
1571086 future joint technology development will be the key success factor in our alliance and we expect to make significant progress in developing memory solutions by focusing on the introduction of new products through systematic co development in product software and controller areas together hynix and numonyx will develop a complete range of products on leading edge technologies that will enable both companies to win in the nand segment well now have one of the broadest nand design communities in the world and we look forward to continued success as we now work to develop new nand memory solutions today and in the future
1571087 success and growth in the nand segment over the next five years will require a unique set of capabilities that we believe we can achieve with hynix
1571088 by combining our expert resources engineering activities and hynixs absolute focus on driving cost we believe well have leading edge technology cost effective and scalable manufacturing industry leading memory system

1571097 many students especially non majors used to think computer science was boring and now they love it we found that bringing personal robots into the classroom creates a dynamic context for learning the foundations of computer science and makes computing a more social and creative activity
1571098 during a time of declining student interest in science and technology our goal is to get as many schools as possible to adopt the curriculum and help reverse that trend
1571099 robots are a compelling way to stimulate students and spark their imaginations to consider the endless possibilities of careers in computer science
1571100 with these awards our continued partnership with georgia tech and bryn mawr college and new technologies such as the microsoft robotics developer studio we hope to accelerate the broad development of robotics programs making computer science more immediate relevant and significant for students and professors everywhere
1571101 we have found that students are really enjoying and learning using the personal robot in the classroom its interactive engaging and fun our numbers of majors and students in computer science is at a record high this is especially encouraging since women have traditionally been underrepresented in the field we hope that these awards can help other institutions make a difference in exploring robots in education
1571102 we believe that the decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
1571103 the states lawsuit isnt about the science of global warming and polar bears
1571104 it is merely doing the bidding of oil companies that want to drill for oil in sensitive polar bear habitat without any concern for how that oil will impact the climate when its burned
1571105 additional regulation of the species and its habitat under the endangered species act will deter activities such as commercial fisheries oil and gas exploration and development transportation and tourism within and off shore of alaska
1571106 the marsh has lost its ability to hold itself together

1571149 there have been individual episodes of so called ordinations of women in various areas of the world moreover the general decree is an instrument of assistance for the bishops to ensure a uniform response from the whole church in the face of these situations

1571151 we continued to experience double digit revenue growth in the second quarter although industry wide volumes in rates were slower during the last three weeks of june as compared to those seen in april and may however our scale built and paid for technology and improved operating efficiencies helped us to achieve significant year over year increases in quarterly distributable earnings
1571152 we are proud to have delivered such dramatic improvements in profitability and are delighted to announce that we will pay our dividend to common shareholders on a quarterly rather than a semi annual basis
1571153 bgc partners had strong organic growth in our equities and credit businesses and saw improvements in revenues and volumes from new fully electronic products particularly in credit default swaps and foreign exchange options where fully electronic revenues in the second quarter of 2008 exceeded the total for all of 2007
1571154 we continue to hire new brokers who will add to our profitability and our broker productivity continued to grow by double digits year over year in the quarter we are also evaluating accretive acquisition opportunities investing in our world class technology and taking other steps that will best position the company for top and bottom line growth in 2009 and beyond

1571210 as our season progressed and it became obvious we were not going to reach the goals we had entering this year we began internal discussions on the best time to convert brandon back to a starting role
1571211 we believe that giving him time to stretch out in tacoma and then hopefully make some starts for the big league club before spending the 2008 offseason preparing to come to camp as a starting pitcher for 2009 is the best route for his development
1571212 im not afraid to take the gospel to the streets
1571213 i went a little more youthful on this release because i think that our young people really need this right now we really need to get their attention they are faced with so much temptation and if we dont do something that makes them feel special that moves and motivates them somebody else will

1571215 but we wanted to make sure because hes got a good opportunity to go up there to the seattle ballclub later in the year and hopefully make the club out of spring training and make that rotation
1571216 but hes a year older now and hes been outstanding all year

1571223 i cant do the team much good unless i get healthy weve been trying to treat it for the last couple of days and it hasnt worked
1571224 we had a chance to use him in a less pressure situation but he wasnt effective
1571225 this is the best thing for his peace of mind
1571226 i came away from the last round quite frustrated as i really wanted to get another win for the airwaves ducati team but its made me more determined to kick up a gear and get back onto the top step of the podium
1571227 ive worked with my engineer on the gearing of my 1098r so im confident well have a good set up for the weekend ive also been training really hard over the past couple of weeks so im feeling in great shape which is going to be really important over these last few rounds of the championship
1571228 it is very difficult because he has the best talent but i beat him in my first race and finished very near to him at barcelona
1571229 it is very very nice to fight with valentino but also with stoner and pedrosa
1571230 the victories gave the team a big boost and after the excitement of riding at
1571231 those wins were so good for everyone they really pumped me up and i was struggling to sleep as my mind was so active thinking about how i could get more
1571232 we had a bad start to the season and were very unlucky on several occasions but now is the time to begin pulling back serious points and making amends
1571233 ive got some really good memories of that event from last year the crowds in glasgow were fantastic so i cant wait to do it all again
1571234 taking the bikes into the city is a great way for us to open up our sport to new audiences and i hope everyone there will continue to follow the championship for the rest of the season
1571235 no i havent spoken to xerox although i spoke today with troy and he said i have nothing against you coming to this team and i think you deserve it
1571236 i said oh thanks please put in a good word for me
1571237 at the end of the day i will put myself forward to the ducati xerox team and if they think that i can be the one then im really happy to come aboard but only if they think i am the one they are looking for
1571238 there are other options as well as xerox but what im really looking for next year is good support to win races and the championship
1571239 i think only a factory team can give you this chance
1571240 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1571241 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1571242 i will be patient and i will be consistent i have faith we will be able to move to the verification process then to the next step
1571243 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist the north korea leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1571244 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1571245 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists thats my hope for the sake of peace thats my hope for the sake of our children
1571246 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds to the extent that people arent able to do that people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake
1571247 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions and your country is a free society
1571248 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1571249 will press hard for what i think is a very fair agreement
1571250 i strongly support your governments request to investigate last months shooting of a south korean tourist

1571304 jesus said that we are to render to god the things that are gods and to caesar those that are caesars our caesar is a government of the people by the people and for the people in order for us to render to caesar the things that are due him we should indeed participate in our government our lord would have it so

1571306 today they put in a the front door and did some minor touch up every room in my house with the exception of the powder room had cracks in it
1571307 they seem to be holding up pretty well im sure its gonna take a long time for them to get through this gianna is doing great she is absolutely the angels picked her up and just set her down but shes walking and running just a typical four and half year old little girl
1571308 we need to get to all the facts in the case and the only way were able to do that is to proceed with the lawsuit
1571309 we do not comment on pending litigation and in fact the company has yet to receive any documentation on the lawsuit plum borough manager michael thomas had no comment
1571310 youve got to be kidding oh that is horrid what size is this
1571311 its all ready to go all you have to do is take the guts out
1571312 clearly brett favres popularity in wisconsin has taken an enormous hit over the last several weeks
1571313 they told him well trade you but not within the division
1571314 his first desire was to play here their first desire was for him not to play here
1571315 i just think brett feels like this reporting to packers camp isnt working
1571316 that basically he was not in the right mindset to play here because of all of the things that went on
1571317 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1571318 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time
1571319 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work and i truly understand that if i was in mikes shoes id see it basically the same way he sees it im sure and i think if he was in my shoes hed see it my way i think we both agree on that they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1571320 its not as simple as no 4 running out there playing football
1571321 hes a great football player i loved coaching him loved seeing him play we talked about all of those things but its a situation that is extremely personal for him the path to get to where we are has done some damage thats where he is
1571322 hes behind but well work to get him up to speed and we know hes the kind of player who will get himself caught up
1571323 right from the start through the draft and minicamps he has shown us things that are innate to successful nfl linebackers
1571324 i want to catch up quick on what i missed and move forward as fast as i can
1571325 coach meidt turned to me and said you were pretty horrible when it came to technique but you made up for it with some good throws
1571326 we had a couple of fortunate catches or i should say risky throws and very fortunate catches when you watch video again
1571327 colt brennan had a couple of plays where they could have gone either way those are things he can learn from
1571328 he has to become a more disciplined quarterback not risk as much as he risks in the game this week it turned out great for us a great performance but it could easily have been the other way
1571329 what he was was very accurate in his throws i thought his decision making was average
1571330 its just a mixed bag and when he sees the video and we make the corrections he will improve
1571331 at the movie theater i saw a kid in a brennan jersey
1571332 focus on the long history and beautiful culture of the chinese people and the new development after reform in china
1571333 we are ready and we are excited we are going to give the audience some great performances
1571334 if our beer doesnt kill you itll sure make you piss stronger
1571335 hells gonna get a helluva lot worse from now on
1571336 its just a bad time to have to go through something like this
1571337 well be fine theyll step up and aaron will come back and hell do well i feel very confident well get him back
1571338 ive always said in order for us to be really what we need to be we need other guys to be able to close games i didnt know we would be forced into that
1571339 its going to be important that some guys step up
1571340 ive closed a few games before so that definitely helps did it a little bit in college
1571341 they are very interested in learning about me my successful story in the united states and also my superstar shawn
1571342 if he believes i can do it if he thinks its the best for me then i have nothing to stop me from believing that
1571343 its just the best feeling ever to know that you have someone there who respects you so much that you can trust them to that level
1571344 some of my relatives are still there theyre so ready to cheer us on theyre so excited to see us coming back
1571345 i want to show their country that the coaches hard work is shown through me
1571346 i want to prove that they are just as successful and amazing as they were when they left
1571347 he was a role model he was working so hard he always had a smiling face
1571348 to have a girl like shawn be in your neighborhood its kind of a once in a lifetime thing especially in the state of iowa where the population is small and theres no high school gymnastics theres just a limited number of clubs
1571349 if you cant do it they kick you out the door they dont deal with keeping people happy
1571350 i dont think youll find many athletes in the history of the sport thats all around the world who practice like that
1571351 i guarantee you theyre in the gym 40 hours a week
1571352 he always figures out when to push and when to take a step back shes always able to perform the best whenever the most important competitions are coming up
1571353 when you are focused the way athletes only like michael phelps and shawn johnson are you reduce the risk for injury
1571354 in our little town shes a huge star but shes like a normal kid helping other kids moving equipment moving the mats all the little things other kids are doing shes doing theres no exceptions
1571355 i didnt understand the concept that people were coming out to help shawn johnson train or get back in her gym
1571356 i didnt see the reason for anybody to do that
1571357 we have been working together since she was 6 years old a toothless little girl
1571358 im not even scratching the surface of being able to react right now im still out there thinking im sure as camp goes on ill become more comfortable in the scheme and be able to react more quickly
1571359 you can have 10 or 11 checks on one play just recognizing formations and all the shifts that go on is pretty difficult im far from there im still trying to learn from the old guys
1571360 the physical abilities of all three of them are obvious
1571361 the speed of mayo the quickness of guyton crables length those are physical attributes but the thing i like is their attitude they are willing to accept the many things that we are asking them to do
1571362 chris slade helped me a lot willie mcginest those are two guys i leaned on those are two guys whose pads i carried off the field
1571363 that really broke me in i tell those guys that 13 years ago i was doing that too
1571364 im just trying to learn as much as i can
1571365 its a true blessing to have the older guys like that be able to help you and like ive said since day one im just trying to be a sponge and learn as much as i can
1571366 my changeup was real good thats what ive been waiting for
1571367 give all the credit to j j he kept us in the game
1571368 these were two hard losses games we had a chance to win
1571369 you cant panic but you have to take it with a sense of urgency
1571370 we havent held opponents below five runs in many of those games we havent come up with big hits its a combination of a lot of different things
1571371 i was a little nervous because it was the yankees and i never faced a team of that caliber before
1571372 ive been watching the yankees since i was little to pitch against them was unbelievable
1571373 i just tried to put the ball in play every game against those guys is a high energy game
1571374 no more smoking drugs drinking and bar hopping will you change with me or not
1571375 you do not want to be that person any more but yourself
1571376 he can outbox most of these guys when he boxes hes hard to hit which means that hes going to hit and not be hit that is what we want
1571377 i watched my father sacrifice a lot to make sure i was at the gym on time
1571378 hed stay up until 3 4 in the morning working with me on certain combinations i watched my mother sacrifice working when we needed money for trips just to have them here is a way for me to thank them
1571379 everybody wanted to be around my father and boxing my three younger brothers would hide in the back of the car so they wouldnt be left behind when wed head off to the gym
1571380 we made a deal that when we had boys he could name them
1571381 i can knock the guy out and hell still find something that i was doing wrong and hell try to correct it
1571382 we try to keep the gym separated when were home
1571383 as a result of that i was ostracized by the kids in my neighborhood
1571384 i was amazed at how well little gary boxed at such a young age
1571385 his strengths are his hand speed his balance having a very good eye at seeing punches coming and not get hit hes very accurate when he throws his punches
1571386 a lot of people dont know hes a very spiritual person
1571387 i just want fans to know that im not the one who took it off the table
1571388 we just didnt see eye to eye on a couple of things and that was it
1571389 i was getting ahead then zoning my sights down and they were beating the ground up
1571390 these last two games were probably my top two of the year so far
1571391 was about as good as weve seen it this year
1571392 you hate to see a game decided on two hitters but thats what it came down to
1571393 zach keeps throwing like that hes going to be fine
1571394 unfortunately i made one bad decision and against brandon webb thats all it takes
1571395 it was a curveball it wasnt a bad pitch it just wasnt the right pitch
1571396 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past all of the things that have happened i need to keep the train moving and he respects that he understands that
1571397 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1571398 so they can say they welcome me back but come on the way theyve treated me tells you the truth
1571399 why did paleolithic people have a shorter life expectancy than we do today
1571400 how did the life expectancy of paleolithic people compare to that of pre industrial neolithic people
1571401 i was on the river 90 percent of my young life
1571402 i love the sport it gives you patience ease you can just sit and gaze over the river
1571403 he already knows how to bait his own hook because i taught him
1571404 live bait is more important for fishing on the river
1571405 artificial lures are good for lakes and streams but even then live bait is still better
1571406 my reaction after the trade was that we just went from being a really good team to one that has a chance to really win this thing
1571407 we knew that when we got him that was part of the equation
1571408 a total of 1 146 servicemen recently applied for 65 vacancies for the first recruitment for the ninth contingent of the zaytun unit producing a record high competition ratio of 17 6 1 a military spokesman said tuesday
1571409 the downside is that its hard to find work for him it could be hurting him and were definitely concerned we dont want him to lose his edge
1571410 right now we feel we need him hes a good guy to have
1571411 we dont want to use him in a simulated game because then we wouldnt be able to use him that night

1571423 we needed to win a game regardless of how we won it
1571424 we lost four straight and i dont think we played bad baseball until that last inning
1571425 thats not a good indication right off the bat as to how to go about that situation
1571426 youve got a four run lead and youre going out there to get three outs unfortunately i wasnt able to do that
1571427 lets not get ahead of ourselves thats how it is right now thats how its got to be nothing replaces what we had here in wagner so weve just got to hold the fort tread water down there until billy gets back

1571471 hai orang orang yang beriman bertobatlah kepada allah dengan tobat yang sebesar besarnya mudah mudahan tuhan kemu akan menghapus kesalahan kesalahanmu dan memasukkan kamu ke dalam sorga yang mengalir di bawahnya sungai sungai pada hari ketika allah tidak menghinakan nabi dan orang orang yang beriman bersama dengan dia sedang cahaya mereka memancar di hadapan dan di sebelah kanan mereka sambil mereka mengatakan
1571472 dan kepunyaan allah lah timur dan barat maka ke manapun engkau menghadap di situlah wajah allah
1571473 jika hamba hamba ku bertanya padamu tentang diri ku aku adalah dekat aku mengabulkan seruan orang yang memanggil jika ia dipanggil aku
1571474 sebenarnya kami ciptakan manusia dan kami tahu apa yang dinisikkan dirinya kepadanya kami lebih dekat kepadanya daripada pembuluh darahnya sendiri
1571475 hai manusia sesungguhnya janji allah adalah benar maka sekali kali janganlah kehidupan dunia memperdayakan kamu dan sekali kali janganlah setan yang pandai menipu memperdaya kamu tentang allah
1571476 katakanlah kesenangan di dunia ini hanya sementara dan akhirat itu lebih baik untuk orang orang yang bertakwa
1571477 sesunguhnya orang yang paling mulia diantara kamu di sisi allah adalah orang yang paling bertakwa di anatar kamu
1571478 dan hanya kepada allah lah orang orang yang beriman itu bertawakkal
1571479 maka bersabarlah kamu karena sesunguhnya janji allah itu benar dan mohonlah ampun untuk dosamu dan bertasbihlah seraya memuji tuhanmu pada waktu petang dan pagi
1571480 allah ridla terhadap mereka dan mereka pun ridla terhadap nya
1571481 wahai allah hidupkanlah aku dalam kemiskinan dan matikanlah aku selaku orang miskin
1571482 wahai tuan bukankah dosamu yang terdahulu dan yang akan datang telah diampuni allah mengapa engkau masih terlalu banyak melakukan shalat
1571483 sesungguhnya aku meminta ampun kepada allah dan bertobat kepada nya setiap hari tujuh puluh kali
1571484 zuhudlah terhadap dunia niscaya allah akan mencintaimu dan zuhudlah terhadap apa yang ada di tangan orang banyak niscaya mareka pun akan mencintaimu
1571485 barangsiapa yang memusuhi wali ku maka aku umumkan permusuhan ku terhadapnya tidak ada sesuatu yang mendekatkan hamba ku kepada yang lebih ku sukai dari pada pengamalan segala yang kufardlukan atasnya kemudian hamba ku yang senantiasa mendekatkan diri kepada ku dengan melaksanakan amal amal sunah maka aku senantiasa mencintainya bila aku telah jatuh cinta kepadanya jadilah aku pendengarannya yang dengannya ia mendengar aku penglihatannya yang dengannya ia melihat aku tangannya yang dengannya ia memukul aku kakinya yang dengan itu ia berjalan bila ia memohon kepada ku aku perkenankan permohonannya jika ia meminta perlindungan ia ku lindungi
1571486 sayangilah yang ada dibumi niscaya kau akan disayangi oleh yang ada di langit

1571490 the guys been snake bitten somewhat because of a variety of things that have happened to him and i think everybodys very much aware of his history
1571491 if the pitchers are going to come out there and pump strikes were going to be aggressive and swing
1571492 we get the reputation of being too aggressive and swinging at everything but we dont preach that here we talk about having good at bats and working counts weve always done that
1571493 our guys when they get comfortable and they get confident i think you see a lot more of that
1571494 when theyre struggling you see them pressing and swinging at a lot of bad pitches
1571495 thats one guy where youre really seeing that stat improve and im really happy

1571502 this is my first road trip with them so that should help
1571503 if we dont get a strong number oil prices will likely fall further
1571504 elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters

1571515 speziell honda und ducati waren interessante optionen ich habe daher sowohl mit honda als auch mit ducati gesprochen
1571516 ich habe mich dann aber zum verbleib bei yamaha entschieden weil ich mit den leuten bei yamaha ein sehr gutes habe und ich somit auch weiter mit meinem crewchief jerry burgess zusammenarbeiten kann
1571517 es wird sicher nicht leicht diese performance auch in diesem jahr zu wiederholen denn das rennen geht diesmal nur ber acht statt 24 stunden
1571518 wir waren ein wenig entt uscht als wir geh rt haben dass das rennen diesmal nur ber acht stunden gehen wird
1571519 ich denke diese konstellation kommt den 1000er motorr dern sicher entgegen aber der langstrecken sport bringt immer wieder berraschungen
1571520 the team is certainly stronger now and better prepared psychologically to play in a final
1571521 we have to win this first match because we know we will have other difficult ones ahead
1571522 its going to be a difficult match but we need at least a tie we need to give our best from the beginning
1571523 the olympics is a big deal in america in many ways a bigger deal than the world cup and the players are in good spirits and ready to go

1571525 you told us that when monkeys bare their teeth theyre not smiling theyre fearful and i saw that face on a packet of cereal you also said monkeys shouldnt wear clothes because its undignified
1571526 that kind of thing doesnt happen often but makes a difference in that childs life
1571527 ive seen so many young people who have lost hope they are apathetic bitter angry and even violent because they feel we have taken their future away from them and we have
1571528 if we see a brick wall as all these problems that weve inflicted on the planet hundreds and thousands of young people around the world like roots and shoots can break through
1571529 the need couldnt be more urgent and the time couldnt be more opportune with our enhanced understanding of the challenges we face to act now to safeguard our own survival and that of future generations
1571530 there have been enough wake up calls since brundtland i sincerely hope geo 4 is the final one

1571533 the amount of resources needed to sustain it exceeds what is available
1571534 in africa land degradation and even desertification are threats per capita food production has declined by 12 percent since 1981
1571535 of the major vertebrate groups that have been assessed comprehensively over 30 percent of amphibians 23 percent of mammals and 12 percent of birds are threatened
1571536 some of the progress achieved in reducing pollution in developed countries has been at the expense of the developing world where industrial production and its impacts are now being exported
1571537 for some of the persistent problems the damage may already be irreversible
1571538 the only way to address these harder problems requires moving the environment from the periphery to the core of decision making environment for development not development to the detriment of environment
1571539 but all too often it has been slow and at a pace and scale that fails to respond to or recognize the magnitude of the challenges facing the people and the environment of the planet
1571540 over the past 20 years the international community has cut by 95 percent the production of ozone layer damaging chemicals
1571541 a greenhouse gas emission reduction treaty along with innovative carbon trading and carbon offset markets

1571557 the little girl stood before me and asked me in english do you know where my mummy is
1571558 next i asked the little girl what her name was and she said my name is maggie
1571559 when i repeated it the little girl said no my name is maddy
1571560 the worst thing is that all this time madeleine has been let down by this lack of apparent co ordination
1571561 that was the greatest frustration of the whole thing kate and gerry did not know what was being done
1571562 this material was never shown to kate gerry their friend jane tanner or anyone else in the group they were dinging with
1571563 seeing it in the files is the first they have known about it again one has to ask what the police were doing by not making this material available at the time
1571564 it is frankly outrageous that information relating to potential suspects was not made available as a matter of extreme urgency once it was clear what had happened
1571565 the early stages of this were crucial and the police of all people should know that
1571566 the investigators are well aware that their work is not exempt from imperfections
1571567 they worked with an enormous margin of error and they achieved very little in terms of conclusive results
1571568 this is not unfortunately a police story a crime fit for the investigative mind of a sherlock holmes or a hercule poirot guided by the illusion that the forces of law and justice always restore order
1571569 no element of proof whatsoever was found which allows us to form any lucid sensible serious and honest conclusion about the circumstances of madeleines disappearance
1571570 if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on we need to know what happened with this
1571571 it is one of the mysteries of the whole thing and it is tragic that it should come this late on
1571572 the little girl stood before me and asked me in english do you know where my mummy is
1571573 i answered that her mother was a little bit further back in the shop and she answered she is not my mummy
1571574 i asked her who the woman was and she said she is a stranger she took me from my mummy i noticed the little girl spoke good english without an accent
1571575 next i asked the little girl what her name was and she said my name is maggie
1571576 when i repeated it the little girl said no my name is maddy
1571577 it is shocking it is harrowing to read this account whether it was madeleine or not it is harrowing to hear a child saying that
1571578 we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police if that hasnt been done that is exactly the kind of information that the private investigators are going to follow up
1571579 i know the hideout name address everything of the kidnappers
1571580 home sweet home which totally reminds me of david so the three of us all stood there with tears in our eyes
1571581 people will forget what you did people will forget what you said but people will never forget how you made them feel
1571582 to use the name of a major religions deity in the restaurant brand runs contrary to this citys reputation as a place of equality and respect for others views and religious beliefs
1571583 hmm i bet if i download the zip version of the mac osx release it would work on linux
1571584 instead of the two picks they couldve gotten they acquired matt laporta an outfielder with power who could help them next year and hes already been paid his signing bonus if you take two draft picks you have to sign them at about 1 million per and you have no idea if theyre going to pan out the value of draft picks is overblown
1571585 but it was a decision made based on living a pain free life
1571586 i still think i can perform at the big league level
1571587 i try to stay with the same game plan and wait for my pitch
1571588 bunt a guy on base bunt him to second bunt him to third hope for a passed ball
1571589 was e mailing me late at night with gobbledygook ranting and raving
1571590 that both of us avoid relapsing into our previous substance abuse
1571591 with the delta announcement you really hit the tipping point
1571592 but you do not want to get on the plane and decide thats where youre going to download the digital version of gone with the wind
1571593 i feel pretty strongly about people not using their mobile phones on planes because you know what its like even on the train
1571594 theres nothing wrong with getting more work done on a flight
1571595 boston to california or chicago to a huge amount of time where you could be really productive just learn how to shut down for dinner or for an hour
1571596 ive got more than enough to keep me busy anyway
1571597 we got delayed and sat on a runway for the entire super bowl
1571598 it wasnt extraordinarily fast but it was quite adequate and it was a good service
1571599 we are so connected between blackberries and everything else that anxiety sets in for a lot of people
1571600 theyre afraid not to be connected theyre afraid of what they might miss for an hour an hour and a half im fine two or three hours i dont know
1571601 we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death
1571602 and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1571603 heath was a friend his death is a tragic loss
1571604 i think this traffic light camera thing is a mess
1571605 think of the anxiety its going to create if youre worrying about being under a light at the right time
1571606 for some people its a game to see if they can get through the light
1571607 these cameras work 24 hours a day and you cant have a policeman at each intersection 24 hours a day
1571608 but im saying its one alternative you may look at
1571609 this issue has come up several times in the past
1571610 were not here tonight to get a decision from you
1571611 im all for this program and i would like to see victoria do this
1571612 i would rather lose some of my civil liberties if i thought it saved lives
1571613 we were not pleased with the situation we were in
1571614 that is a trade we would make any day of the week
1571615 ultimately he got traded because of certain things that occurred that it got to a point where things were different than they were in the past
1571616 there are times when there are things that are so poignant and so significant to a club and to the individuals in that clubhouse that the distraction becomes real and it becomes an actual impediment to winning baseball games
1571617 a very solid offensive player he projects to be just a tick below manny offensively hes a very solid defensive left fielder he runs the bases very well and hes a good teammate
1571618 if you look up the numbers in david ortizs entire career with the red sox his ops with manny hitting behind him is identical to his ops without manny hitting behind him
1571619 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1571620 if there is a subtle shift in the feds risk assessment it is that while acknowledging the downside risks to growth it notes the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1571621 this may have been a sufficient bone to the hawks to prevent others from joining fisher in dissenting

1571658 outsiders may think that the tibetans are treated very well and that they are happy but the truth is that tibetans are not free to speak of their suffering
1571659 even if i had to sacrifice my life for this message to be seen by the dalai lama i agree and welcome this chance
1571660 it is very difficult for tibetans to go to beijing and speak out there so that is why we decided to show the real feelings of tibetans inside tibet through this film

1571714 while george w bush has been president our dependence on foreign oil has gone up almost every year
1571715 while norm coleman has been senator the cost of oil has tripled the cost of gas has doubled and hes talking about doing the same old same old
1571716 the price of has gas just about doubled since nancy pelosi
1571717 and both mr franken and ms pelosi are wrong when they oppose opening up new sources of drilling in the outer continental shelf and theyre wrong when they oppose expanding nuclear energy now
1571718 more than anyone else i know the difference between talk and results
1571719 you have to ask of each candidate what have we done in our lives to merit serving you in the u s senate
1571720 hes been part of the most partisan era of the republican party ever
1571721 so for him to come here and say oh im bipartisan i work across party lines i just people to know what his record has been thats all
1571722 all this hammering i want to know what youre going to do when youre senator
1571723 norm coleman is in the pocket of big oil hes received more contributions from big oil than any other politician in the history of minnesota
1571724 i think the american people will vote obama in because he is not yet the man that he is going to become and mccain is no longer the man that he once was
1571725 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon him
1571726 the biggest problem confronting the world today is the illusion that our differences matter more than our common humanity
1571727 other than telling us how to live think marry pray vote invest educate our children and now die i think the republicans have done a fine job of getting government out of our personal lives
1571728 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent

1571733 the input of other enlightened thinkers who have no doubt also be inspired by god
1571734 that perhaps there is more to life than birth eating f cking and death
1571735 will you continue to ignore my religious beliefs as reality
1571736 there is no more to life than simple materialistic explanations
1571737 the illusion that our thoughts and actions stop and end with our physical bodies are simply not true

1571741 our primary goal since the beginning was to develop a diy designer toy that everyone would enjoy working with folks who may have been curious to work on vinyl figures now have a friendly form they can take out of the box and get straight to being creative

1571745 we are very excited and proud to be partnering with bp a world leader in both the traditional and alternative energy industries that shares our commitment and vision to rapidly evolve next generation ethanol into a commercial scale solution for our energy needs
1571746 in addition to bps world class capabilities in traditional energy production logistics and distribution their commitment to accelerate the development of the global biofuels market was a significant factor in our decision to partner with bp in addition both organizations are aligned on the significant market opportunity and operational imperatives for achieving rapid commercial scale success
1571747 bp is very pleased to be entering this important relationship with verenium we believe energy crops like sugar cane miscanthus and energy cane are the best feedstocks to deliver economic sustainable and scaleable biofuels to the world this deal puts us at the front of the cellulosic biofuels game
1571748 in partnering with verenium we now have the most advanced technology for transforming these energy grasses to biofuels increasing our ability to invest earlier in the us to meet the requirements for cellulosic ethanol laid out in the recent energy bill we also have the possibility of enhancing the productivity of our brazilian assets verenium has already demonstrated the technology making this real and an appropriate fit with our commitment to bring more sustainable biofuels to the market more quickly
1571749 in the second quarter of 2008 we realized record production revenue and earnings results which evidences the successful execution of our development plan we continue to see excellent organic growth in our catalina unit from our newly drilled wells
1571750 i wanted to know if you had any thoughts on private versus public school for a child adopted through the foster care system
1571751 it made no difference whether a man or woman was the jewish partner
1571752 huge emphasis on family and family history but have styles different enough that it keeps it really interesting
1571753 when his family gets together its always desserts and pastries
1571754 the body has all these independent parts the forearms the upper arms the shoulders and they all make up the whole
1571755 focus on finding connections through these segments and you will build strength through integration
1571756 the whole practice of yoga is to align with spirit
1571757 when you let go of focusing only on external strength in the poses by tuning in to the breath and the flow of movement youll find the truth of your strength which is in your spirit spiritual strength always trumps egoic strength

1571761 what type of pas member would believe in liberal ideas isnt islam already complete
1571762 theres no point in working if nobody can see you doing it
1571763 no at least not what youre thinking collins im sure
1571764 she took off last night while my wife and i were in bed she left a note thats all just a note
1571765 because california just legalized gay marriage and doesnt have a residency requirement like massachusetts
1571766 dick cheney can go expletive himself when i found out about this marty woman any time i brought up pennys relationship with her all she could talk about was dick cheneys daughter or sometimes the indigo girls or gertrude stein and alice b toklas but mostly dick cheneys daughter
1571767 so her friend marty shes ah butch the masculine element that is
1571768 you mean you think my daughter and this marty woman they have oh my god they have
1571769 what youre thinking of is called an hermaphrodite and theyre extremely rare bisexuality on the other hand is quite common maybe its just a phase theyre going through a lot of young women take up with each other these days because they find the males in their age cohort unsuitable
1571770 because of the way the american public education system has been run for the last two or three decades a lot of young males these days are absurdly immature having been coddled in a cocoon of gratuitous personal validation where the only thing that matters is ensuring that they not develop low self esteem and having been conditioned to respond to that instead of achievement quite a few of them cant cope with the slightest failure or disappointment combine such a phenomenon with our societys traditional focus on unrealistic images of females and the ubiquitous spiraling trend toward a culture of instant gratification and not to put too fine a point on it what weve got here is a generation of pathetic little snots who would rather hang out in their parents basement whacking off to the whores in grand theft auto than venture outside for a date with a real girl like your daughter
1571771 its societys fault you mean thats where all these useless sniveling thirteen year old boys in thirty year old mens bodies come from
1571772 so who can blame young women for shacking up with each other instead of trying to make a go of it with guys like that
1571773 that she and her friend marty are just experimenting exploring alteratives to marrying men in their peer group who after all still own skateboards and dirt bikes and furthermore still play with them regularly
1571774 but i dont know thinking about it her being bisexual and all i just dont know its not like i believe its genetic or anything collins there arent any gay genes and i doubt there are any bisexual genes either its a moral choice thats what i believe thats what any good conservative believes and what if god decides to punish penny for going to bed with another woman instead of one of those useless males in her cohort when somebody breaks gods edicts you cant blame society for it gods a personal responsibility type of guy you know and he doesnt send abstract concepts like society to hell either
1571775 while its true that certain passages of the old testament condemn male homosexuality
1571776 it says nothing about lesbians and furthermore theres nothing in the new testament about either subject
1571777 are you telling me that god who remembered to tell us everything in leviticus and deuteronomy forgot to damn lesbians
1571778 no wonder this country is such a mess next youll tell me the rapture isnt in the bible either
1571779 its not the rapture was invented and promulgated by american protestant theologians in the nineteenth century there isnt a word about lesbians or the rapture in either testament
1571780 and i suppose that cleanliness is next to godliness isnt in the book of proverbs
1571781 and i suppose god helps those who help themselves isnt in there either
1571782 the bible says nothing about bisexuals because it took until the twentieth century for liberal psychological pseudo science to make it up didnt it
1571783 no one can say why god never mentioned lesbians or bisexuals
1571784 but im sure he had his reasons and im also sure that if he were concerned about those issues he would have let us know
1571785 depending on the interpretation of a few verses in the old testament he hates male homosexuals maybe not but you certainly cant say that everybody knows god hates lesbians or bisexuals
1571786 with a tip of the hatlo hat to gertrude stein perhaps
1571787 gertrude stein said a fag is a fag is a fag
1571788 she said a rose is a rose is a rose
1571789 even if penny and marty stay together for the rest of their lives
1571790 the lesbians contact a few hiv negative and otherwise healthy gay men who come over and throw a party in the living room
1571791 hello now now stop crying what happened you did she did he did they are okay okay princess dont worry sure right away okay
1571792 good all right ill call back as soon as ive taken care of things bye bye princess that was penny
1571793 she said they arrived at san francisco international airport last night but they couldnt get to city hall before it closed even though it stayed open extra late to accomodate all the gay couples who wanted to get marriage certificates after the new law took effect yesterday afternoon so they went to martys cousins house in oakland where they were going to stay for their honeymoon penny says martys cousins brother in law whos a lumberjack from oregon was visiting there too and around two thirty in the morning that would be pacific time which is what about forty five minutes ago she walked in on them making love in one of the guest bedrooms then she and marty had a big fight and broke up and now penny wants to come home but she says her credit card is maxed out and can i call the credit card company and get her credit line increased by two thousand dollars so she can fly home right away
1571794 looks like you have a few things to do that require your immediate attention want to reschedule our appointment
1571795 since its likely pennys in a uh receptive state of mind now do you know of any boys about her age who she might you know get interested in just to prevent any ah you know similar uh problems in the future
1571796 but all the young men i can think of either already
1571797 senator clinton asks me to remind you that she is senator clinton not some um other person
1571798 you know the former presidential candidate and possibly the democratic vice presidental running mate in our upcoming election
1571799 please mr collins do so an excellent idea to seize such an opportunity

1571806 ira used to be a hedge fund manager at bear stearns
1571807 downtown having dinner before the theater you know i cant really say we havent actually eaten anything here yet but the wine list certainly looks intriguing yes dear we means me and tom of course not absolutely tell me about it all right you go girl oh no come on get out sure well if he doesnt i will dont worry about it
1571808 mortgage meltdown fraud cases the fbi is rounding up crooks on wall street like the coast guard pouncing on a colombian marijuana convoy that accidently sailed up the miami river
1571809 the word is a couple of bear stearns hedge fund managers named ralph cioffi and matthew tannin allegedly swindled the usual assortment of suckers out of about one point six billion bucks all by themselves lord knows what the fbi will claim the other three hundred ninety eight alleged lying thieving scum bags allegedly did
1571810 what do you mean by the usual assortment of suckers
1571811 oh you know a gaggle of ivy league twits with no common sense whose family and connections got them jobs where theyre in charge of huge amounts of money that belongs to widows orphans and old people plus a swarm of joe and jane blows with 401 k or other private investment accounts
1571812 securities fraud misleading investors lying about material attributes of financial instruments and conspiracy too thats pretty nasty stuff isnt it fraud and conspiracy on a billion dollar scale
1571813 but i think i read they could get seven to ten years if they are of course convicted and we need to recognize that unless that happens both of them must be presumed innocent until proven guilty furthermore we should also bear in mind that cioffi and tannin might very well just be a couple of perfectly nice regular honest guys like the guys youd meet at your local youth group picnic tossing baseballs to cute kids trying out that mitt they got for their birthday or the guys youd find sitting with their family next to your own family at the neighborhood cineplex enjoying the latest uplifting action packed family oriented family values blockbuster it could turn out at the end of the day in the fullness of time that these men are in fact hardworking clean living patriotic guys who love their country and their families particularly their dear sainted mothers their sweet respectful angel faced children their faithful devoted stalwart lovely virtuous wives and their adorable little family dogs barney and checkers respectively gentlemen who in fact wouldnt even imagine doing anything illegal and who are in reality simply being callously used by heartless incompetent headline grubbing government operatives as hapless scapegoats for other peoples regrettably bad judgment as im sure their large and expensive teams of high powered attorneys are preparing to argue even as we speak
1571814 is that all how can they be so lenient why dont they have stiffer sentences for securities fraud conspiracy
1571815 poor people get huge prison terms for non violent crime
1571816 there are tens of thousands of poor people doing twenty and thirty year sentences for stuff like writing bad checks dealing in stolen goods or engaging in prostitution and i bet if you added up the ill gotten gains for all of them for all of their crimes for all of their lives it wouldnt be anywhere near one point six billion dollars
1571817 the law always takes that into account along with how serious the crime is of course the length of incarceration is supposed to reflect among other things based on the frequency of infraction and impact of the offenses how great a menace to society the convicted miscreant poses convicts serving twenty or thirty year terms got those sentences because on that basis they are considered to present a significant menace to society
1571818 excuse me but how many times does someone have to steal a billion dollars before they are considered a significant menace to society
1571819 does betting on sub prime mortgage derivatives to win place and show sound like a good idea
1571820 that an awful lot of people on wall street were doing it
1571821 and if an awful lot of people on wall street do something
1571822 back in october of 1929 a lot of people in the stock market jumped out their windows and made big bloody splatters on the sidewalk therefore if we follow the reasoning you just espoused opening a skyscraper window jumping out and landing on wall street might be a good idea for a lot of self proclaimed financial experts these days
1571823 that it was a good idea in 1929 but not anymore
1571824 these days you cant open the windows on wall street skyscrapers
1571825 i hear the feds allege that cioffi was bailing out of his own position in bond securities while assuring his investors there was nothing to worry about but obviously you never did anything like that or youd be sitting at the next table ordering wine yourself although maybe fresh out of a federal courthouse on bail eh
1571826 yes a lot of other people were doing that kind of thing
1571827 but a lot of others actually believed what they were saying
1571828 i thought that the markets were over reacting to the numbers and so i kept my money in the debt derivatives market just like the investors in my hedge fund did
1571829 oh i tried to recover of course but after the sub prime snowball got started down the hill well as im sure you both know about the only investment that wouldnt wipe a person out completely was selling for cash and stuffing it under the bedroom mattress
1571830 as we can see you couldnt bring yourself to go that far so what did you do instead
1571831 i i just couldnt put it in a bank account
1571832 no i kept looking at the interest rate and thinking how puny it was and i didnt want to put it in t bills either because the interest rates on those pretty much sucked too and i wanted more liquidity so i i put my last eight hundred grand in auction rate securities
1571833 as im sure you know the banks let the owners of auction rate securities use them as the basis for a credit line so in march i took out an loc for the maximum amount i could get
1571834 i started trading commodities i couldnt help it i felt like i had to do something i needed to keep on being a player but then i got totally wiped out in a crude oil futures margin call
1571835 and shortly after that my mortgage payments went through the roof and when i couldnt sell my house i got foreclosed so now i do this speaking of which would either of you like wine with your meal
1571836 i did my usual background check on him when we started dating you know and i can assure you he must have gotten the job on the basis of what he learned about wine when he was ordering it on bear stearns expense account lunches because he certainly never received any formal training in oh whats that called
1571837 and he certainly never worked as a wine steward before either i bet
1571838 he lied on his r sum just like he did so he could get a job a bear stearns
1571839 i know for a fact his bear stearns r sum had more whoppers than a burger king
1571840 instead of having graduated summa cum laude from cambridge university with a degree in applied econometric mathematics and a minor in computer science and receiving an mba from wharton in quantitative finance ira really only holds a two year associates degree in retail outlet management with a major in collectable comics marketing and a minor in action figure curation from peter pryor community college in hoboken new jersey
1571841 those morons at bear stearns are bigger suckers than their customers
1571842 mustahil belum pernah tuh ada yang bisa keluar apalagi kamu

1571853 dad was like it was people like carlin who stood up for free speech in this country and uncle hank was like he stood up for anarchists acid heads flower children commies and sodomites thats what he stood up for whats a sodomite
1571854 you can only ask your parents about them and dont nag or make a fuss if they dont want to answer either
1571855 there are plenty more take this movie bombed at the box office for example theres another seven words youll never ever hear or see on television or how about this program produced entirely with scab labor arab villains created by jewish studio executives or the products we advertise are chinese trash see all of them are seven words too and youll never ever see or hear them on television either
1571856 something like all new york locations filmed in toronto would be one of them too i mean youd never ever see or hear that on a television show
1571857 designate someone to write down what we come up with
1571858 told me your sister in law said to feed everybody cookies and milk
1571859 when you could have told her it was your idea
1571860 lied to tom and said you told them he was to feed everybody cookies
1571861 and besides i had no choice i was isolated outnumbered and surrounded
1571862 ahora hay dos ofertas una de emiratos arabes que ortega est descartando porque le surgi una propuesta de independiente rivadavia que tambi n lo ayudar a con un tratamiento ambulatorio

1571864 studies have shown that microbes can survive the shock levels of being launched into space
1571865 and as more and more organisms are discovered under extreme conditions its become more plausible that things could survive in space for the time it takes to go from one planet to another
1571866 one hundred years ago people wondered if animals could go from one land mass to another
1571867 everything that is going on on earth occurred because the meteorites happened to land here but they are obviously landing in other places
1571868 if there is another planet that has the water and all of the things that are needed for life you should be able to get the same process rolling
1571869 the universe is mostly empty space but here and there are special places where complex things can happen clouds of dust planetary surfaces comets and asteroids
1571870 we estimate with obviously imperfect information that we are the market leader
1571871 my sister never committed terrorism she was never involved in such activities
1571872 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1571873 i decided to break my silence to say that one is innocent until proven guilty my sister is innocent and has never been actually accused of any crime
1571874 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announced that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman
1571875 we are receiving threats through phone calls and sms not to discuss or pursue aafias case i do not know who are the people threatening us
1571876 a trial that depends on handicapping the defense cant possibly be fair
1571877 the military judge tried at times to mitigate the commissions most unjust rules but the flaws in the system won out
1571878 a trial of this magnitude should have a meaningful public record
1571879 its much harder to trust the verdict of the military jury when evidence and witness testimony is unnecessarily kept secret
1571880 the fact that hamdan could be acquitted and still not released makes arguments over the trial rules more than a little absurd
1571881 but convicting someone with unfair rules cant ever be just
1571882 the personnel entered a second floor meeting room unaware that siddiqui was being held there unsecured behind a curtain
1571883 shortly after the meeting began the captain heard a woman yell from the curtain and when he turned saw siddiqui holding the warrant officers rifle and pointing it directly at the captain
1571884 the interpreter seated closest to siddiqui lunged at her and pushed the rifle away as siddiqui pulled the trigger siddiqui fired at least two shots but no one was hit the warrant officer returned fire with a 9 mm service pistol and fired approximately two rounds at siddiquis torso hitting her at least once
1571885 thinking that she had explosives and would attack them as a suicide bomber shot her and and took her
1571886 her rape and torture is a crime beyond anything she was ever accused of
1571887 for a long time my family and i have kept our silence because we knew she was innocent and also based on threats of severe consequences if we spoke
1571888 turning the country into a war field by becoming an ally in the so called us war on terror
1571889 the mqm propaganda is a plot to pit citizens of karachi against each other
1571890 even prime minister yusuf raza gillani is ignoring the parliament
1571891 would the reaction have been the same had this been a man making this claim
1571892 the united states will videotape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1571893 obviously we knew that interrogations by foreign personnel were recorded since omars canadian lawyers had obtained release of the canadian videos from the canadian government whats interesting is that we learn more and more each day about evidence that exists in these cases that was previously secret
1571894 although mr khadr is no longer a juvenile he was 15 years old when he was alleged to have committed crimes in afghanistan canada has sought to ensure that the treatment of mr khadr is consistent with internationally recognized norms and standards for the treatment of juvenile offenders and that his age at the time the alleged events occurred is considered in all parts of the process
1571895 we remain concerned that other governments were in there and were complicit whether or not they were involved in ill treatment
1571896 the tapes could be evidence of human rights violations or criminal behaviour
1571897 protect the interests and ensure the safety of all concerned
1571898 translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1571899 notwithstanding what theyre saying this is not standard operating procedure
1571900 this relates to a common theme of the motions we filed yesterday monday which is the governments rush to convict omar while fighting our ability to get access to secret evidence or learn what else that government might have in its possession
1571901 may explain why prosecutors have fought so hard not to disclose evidence of omars interrogations at bagram and guantanamo bay
1571902 picture this woman who is very tiny and ask yourself how she engaged in armed conflict with six military men
1571903 its not plausible its not credible and theres nothing to support it
1571904 she is shot she is in pain we were able to look at the dressing you can see its stained and oozing
1571905 you tell me you can put down an m4 rifle right by your foot and this 90lb woman is behind the curtain and you do not realise until the rifle is in her hand
1571906 what the real story is i dont know you dont know nobody knows
1571907 all i know is that i have a person whos shot here
1571908 this is a very intelligent woman what is she doing outside of the governors residence the woman is a ph d is a woman like this really that stupid there is an incongruity and i have trouble accepting the governments claims
1571909 if she was carrying fluids and was considered dangerous then why was she left unattended in a room behind a curtain and this dangerous hardened criminal picks up a gun and misses
1571910 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1571911 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1571912 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan
1571913 shes very traumatized very fragile she doesnt know where her children are
1571914 but in the near term at least we would consider him an enemy combatant and still a danger and would likely still be detained for some period of time thereafter

1571927 legal amp general earns around 80 90 of its revenue in the uk that has been a very deliberate decision you need scale in this business you dont make money by having 100 small businesses we are number one or two in most of the areas we want to be in but we have started to think of where our growth is going to come from in five years time and our conclusion is that it will be in emerging markets
1571928 the economy is in a downturn but it is unclear how long or how deep it will be and there are risks to consumer spending and employment levels it is very difficult to see the exact shape of the adjustment currently taking place and it does make future planning very much more difficult
1571929 its now clear that in fact he has a very strong defence to this extradition
1571930 he should now be released pending the completion of the extradition proceedings
1571931 theyre trying to smear the reputation of an islamic religious institution without any basis at all

1571936 to close guantanamo try those accused of terrorist acts in a fair process release or resettle the others and finally put an end to this black spot on americas reputation
1571937 it may be that the instruction was erroneous but i guess youve waived the right to challenge it by not challenging it sooner
1571938 we think that youve seen a fair and transparent process
1571939 this trial was a betrayal of american values and will rightly be seen as illegitimate by the rest of the world
1571940 we plan on charging at least 80 individuals down here
1571941 these record breaking figures prove that stephenie meyer is a pop culture sensation
1571942 stephenie has created an extraordinary world that readers of all ages have embraced and we couldnt be happier to be part of the twilight phenomenon
1571943 i find myself where i was four years ago trying to get someone in our government to explain why these men are being held
1571944 my clients have been a vehicle for a global civics lesson on the rule of law
1571945 it is a construct it is in effect a sub human category
1571946 some of these men met for the first time in guantanamo
1571947 i am sad to say that the accounts youve heard of horror humiliation and abuse are true
1571948 theyd look down at their feet chained together and to the floor of the 8 by 6 interrogation room and theyd look down at their orange jumpsuits
1571949 ultimately sometimes by the skin of our teeth our legal system comes forward
1571950 lets punish them but lets do it the way america has done it for more than 200 years
1571951 we are not ready to expose members of our defense establishment to potential prosecution
1571952 there are bits of legislation that hobble the courts ability to give us our day
1571953 i hope to listen again when its on the radio
1571954 i suppose ive always grown up around the idea of starting a shop in order to start a scene
1571955 its just a word thats used to describe the enemy you know who they dont want you to like today but maybe those same people they wanted you to like yesterday
1571956 both of my parents names are a lot to live up to
1571957 shes been down to this store and she loved it
1571958 essentially at the root of all thats where i come from where she comes from its the idea that you lead a much more interesting life when you dress up
1571959 i wasnt particularly enamoured with calling it terrorist at first but after a couple of days of rationalising i kind of understood it
1571960 we wanted to do something that was relevant to the history of this whole area
1571961 if people want to buy some clothes from here they can come here and buy the clothes from this shop
1571962 it never stopped me as a little kid going to viviennes shop on the kings road to buy punk rock gear i lived miles away london might as well have been on mars when i was a little kid
1571963 we have a hells angels leg here theyre terrorists right they cause mayhem and frighten everybody
1571964 this is not some kind of scouts hut shop for us to just have a bit of fun in
1571965 the center sought to determine how evidence gathered against any given detainee influenced the decision whether to release him center researchers expected to find that the detainees who presented the greatest threat would have been released last or would still be held at guant namo
1571966 center analysis shows that was not the case the only significant correlation to ones being released the date of his release and status upon release is the nationality of the detainee those from afghanistan pakistan or saudi arabia were more likely to be released and more quickly
1571967 the decisions to release guant namo detainees presumably the worst of the worst were political but its hard to understand the politics guant namo was supposed to make americans safer but some of the most dangerous detainees were released because of their nationality regardless of the evidence the department of defense supposedly gathered against them what our report cant answer is whether that evidence was nonexistent to begin with or whether these releases took place with no regard to our national security
1571968 mow over a grove of trees and name the subdivision some variant of those fallen trees

1571974 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it

1571978 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1571979 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1571980 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1571981 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1571982 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1571983 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs

1571988 we want candidates with criminal records to be barred from contesting elections for that the government has to pass a law which has not been done yet there is a need to do a lot more to see that criminals are barred from elections
1571989 i feel it is on the decrease because of certain measures taken by the commission like compulsory filling of affidavits by candidates about their pasts
1571990 in the next general election the electoral rolls itself will have photographs of voters hopefully it will work to eliminate bogus voters
1571991 the time was not ripe for making voting compulsory in india
1571992 the election commission has been doing its job with a great deal of sensitivity and professionalism
1571993 thoughtful and rigorous debate might be the ultimate moral act

1572003 it wasnt extraordinarily fast but it was quite adequate and it was a good service
1572004 we are so connected between blackberries and everything else that anxiety sets in for a lot of people

1572011 from the current fish and wildlife ban on beluga caviar in the united states
1572012 what put you on this flight from washington to dallas senator
1572013 my latest opportunity to serve my country fell on hard times
1572014 you mean you had to resign from the mccain campaign
1572015 well i suppose i fell into the most common trap inside the beltway
1572016 its happened to the best and the brightest people who
1572017 youre right so why shouldnt it happen to a good old boy who flunked third fifth and seventh grade
1572018 nevertheless you managed to eventually get a ph d in economics from the university of georgia by nothing but plain old hard work senator and as everybody knows being able to work hard is much more important than being intelligent particularly in the field of supply side economics
1572019 to sit in first class next to somebody who understands that
1572020 absolutely inspired he wrote it out for the first time on the back of a cocktail napkin you know
1572021 reagan and the boys casey weinberger baldridge kilpatrick meese regan baker brady and me we were doing them a favor really trickling down all over them why couldnt they just relax and enjoy the unending shower a nation of whiners i tell you nothing but a nation of whiners
1572022 i should think the guys at least would learn to enjoy getting trickled down all over on by a fox like jean kilpatrick
1572023 you mean your work on the gramm leach bliley act the one that got rid of all those silly fire walls between commercial and investment banks
1572024 and made it easier for financial institutions of all kinds to consolidate their businesses and employ new and more exotic financial instruments like derivatives
1572025 as if what i did during the reagan administration for the savings and loan industry wasnt enough there was that too
1572026 and people complain about a measly million dollars wall street contributed to your political war chest
1572027 you seem like a pretty smart objective fellow do you think novak and that expletive carly fiorina could have jumped any faster at a chance to knife me in the back
1572028 and could that snake in the grass douglas holtz eakin have
1572029 and how about jack kemp and steve forbes yonder they come like blue tick hound dogs chasing a rabbit theyre just jealous
1572030 thats all jealous just look what johns doing now that theyve tossed me out running around promising financial bail outs and big federal subsidies thats what
1572031 that senator mccain used to say that you were the strongest person he knew on economic issues and now hes saying that you were just one of a number of advisers on his campaign staff
1572032 could you see your way to part with a mite more of that there caviar
1572033 is not to lose your sense of perspective theyll call be back when they realize they cant get along without me
1572034 why none of those clowns on his policy team now can tell monetarism from rational expectations theory much less present one single believable line of smoke and mirrors that even sounds like a decent reason for returning to a pre keynesian economy and what does mccain do he goes around telling everybody hes a complete economic ignoramus like thats something to be proud of
1572035 reagan and george w bush both came on like complete morons and the voters lapped it up like the free food at happy hour
1572036 but i dont think that strategy will work this time
1572037 i cant say for sure its just a gut feeling i have
1572038 in my heart i believe so i believe in the common sense and goodness of the american people i believe in free markets i believe in supply side economics i believe in god almighty and yes in spite of all thats happened i believe john mccain will be the next president of the united states
1572039 thats just johns weird expletive sense of humor hes got bigger plans for me you can be sure of that
1572040 bob ask that black over there holding the mccain placard what he thinks of the senators speech
1572041 any fool can have a child that doesnt make you a father its the courage to raise a child that makes you a father
1572042 you are not a man because you can make a baby youre only a man if you can raise a baby protect a baby and provide for a baby
1572043 theres an unwritten law that you cannot have a jewish character in a film who isnt 100 percent perfect or youre labeled anti semitic

1572048 dave berman is a provocative speaker whose ideas have had major influence shaping the election integrity message
1572049 thank you you have been a stalwart youve done an awesome job you have educated so many people
1572050 exchange a walk on part in a war for a lead role in a cage
1572051 give a damn about the world you live in give a damn about what you and i both know is one of the most shameful and destructive periods in american history if so do something about it you can start by reading
1572052 dave berman has been candid and confrontational in challenging all of us to be
1572053 dave bermans work is quietly brilliant and powerfully utilitarian his voter confidence resolution provides a fine flexible tool whereby any community can reclaim and affirm a right relation to its franchise as a community of voters
1572054 whats special about this book and it fits because theres nothing more fundamental to democracy than our vote is the raising of consciousness someone recognizing they have no basis for trusting elections may well ask what else is being taken for granted
1572055 wow maybe hell be nice to me for a change
1572056 i dont want you to get the wrong idea mr collins
1572057 having a diversified portfolio of options is a way of life for me
1572058 im a member of upper management at a major financial institution
1572059 please remember that retaining ones equanimity in the face of adversity is the key to crisis management
1572060 simply has no conception of how valuable persons such as yourself are to a vibrant and healthy national economy
1572061 you just convinced me that your advice will be worth every penny i pay for it
1572062 let us therefore not concern ourselves with price quantity supply and demand but rather with the ultimate economic utility which stands behind all of them please sir tell me how can i help you today
1572063 let me see if i can present an appropriate analysis
1572064 in the prosperous years that preceded our current perilous situation elegant lithographs of your likeness appeared on the front page of the wall street journal while financial reporters fawned all over you like groupies hoping to blow the latest pop music star everybody loved you they were thrilled to meet you some those being particularly ambitious young female financial professionals not only asked for your autograph but went beyond simile and actually did fellate you and your wife when so informed didnt even mind the public was encouraged to think of you as a rare and important sort of genius a truly superlative example of gods handiwork a master of industry a maven of money and a maker of markets now however everybody thinks youre some kind of larcenist or at best some kind of moron nobody returns your telephone calls no one answers your rsvp invitations to parties on your outrageously appointed yacht even your own wife wont give you so much as a hand job and in what is surely the unkindest cut of all people are beginning to ask why when the big powerful financial institution you lead is floating in the toilet waiting to be flushed unless of course congress and the president force the taxpayers to bail it out you get paid such a ridiculously high salary
1572065 some people are boiling mad that a person such as yourself can oversee a series of obscene financial debacles and still get compensated as if what they do were actually worth a hoot in hell
1572066 back in the day when the town bank failed because the banks upper management had engaged in some inappropriate financial shenanigans it was a simple straightforward affair the townspeople would gather at the bank and demand their money and when the banks upper management sent the junior apprentice teller out to inform the crowd that their life savings had been squandered on fancy cigars top dollar whores extravagant parties and idiotically expensive champagne that their mortgages were worthless pieces of paper that their investments in the stock market had proved to be nothing more than greasy swindles perpetrated by lowlife scum that the bonds in their grandmothers safe deposit boxes were of use for nothing much more than blowing ones nose or wiping ones arse and that sorry folks this was the way of american capitalism and commerce and that the invisible hand of adam smith therefore decreed that they should lose their jobs their homes their horses and buggies and so forth and henceforward live in degrading penury the townspeople pulled down his pants spanked him pink with fresh cut hickory switches and sent him running home to his mama who everyone expected would be moving out of town by dawn at the latest then they went inside that bank dragged out the bank president the bank vice president and the head teller beat them until all their teeth fell in the dust poked out their left eyes with red hot irons horse whipped them raw and then dumped them into vats of boiling tar after that they dusted them off with feathers and rode them out of town on a rail
1572067 is that as much as our technology and our conception of ourselves changes over the centuries human nature remains pretty much the same so sir you should realize that as the american economy slides into collapse and disintegration you too now confront similar peril and i might add on a constant basis
1572068 im positive people angry that you have screwed up their lives ruined them gotten them tossed out on the street or bankrupted their stock portfolios they could very well come to get you
1572069 swat teams would be out in front shooting them dead like towel headed jihadis in baghdad
1572070 would they throw me into a tank of starving piranhas
1572071 a tank of starving alligators would most certainly tear you to pieces
1572072 but dc has some the largest rats on record right behind new york and philadelphia so they could throw you in a pit full of those
1572073 they could bury you up to your neck in the sand at low tide and leave you to drown or perhaps they would impale you as vlad dracula used to do to those who displeased him or maybe they would skin you alive and drag you behind a truck over a bed of rock salt to writhe in agony while dying like a big red garden slug or somebody might shoot you and be really sloppy about it too they might use a small caliber gun and shoot you in the ankles then in the wrists then in the elbows then in the knees and finally in the gut then twist all your joints around disembowel you and leave you to slowly die from exsanguination or possibly they might tie you to a huge wicker chair with duct tape then set the chair on fire and scream vitriol at you as you burn to death
1572074 lets say they could and whats more they want to so what
1572075 what you need to realize is because of that you have a lot in common with a famous american hero
1572076 exactly like you evel knievel was always in danger of suffering a gory ghastly and gruesome death every time he practiced his profession not only that but on a per minute basis evel knievel made when adjusted for inflation approximately half a million bucks per stunt and each stunt only lasted around one minute now think about it thats what 20 or 30 times more money per minute than you get since right now youre in constant danger of an awful death 24 x 7 and therefore only make twenty thirty maybe forty dollars a minute shucks even a third rate human cannon ball working dinky rural carnivals makes more money per minute than that plus everybody loved evel knievel but everybody hates you now is that fair
1572077 i can truthfully tell you after hearing your advice i feel like a new man as if a terrible weight has been lifted from my shoulders thats
1572078 when a fellow like you has the respect of so many patriotic americans its only fitting he should be here in the round robin quaffing henry clays favorite libation
1572079 just my damn luck the minute i start to catch a decent buzz off a mint julep along comes a tom collins
1572080 they say you shouldnt drink alone so what the hell stick around what are you having
1572081 i like mint drinks fresh mint drinks anyway and besides they do make the best mint julep in town here
1572082 i certainly understood what you meant when you said that riding in an airplane and getting shot down does not constitute a qualification for the presidency
1572083 but its close enough and besides this isnt face the nation and you arent bob schieffer yeah
1572084 you must realize that only completely immoral dastardly sociopaths who hate barack obama care nothing for the democratic process and despise the american public not to mention those principles that all true americans hold dear only habitual miscreants of the lowest imaginable character who are willing to take that remark out of context and spread it all over the media and the internet with shameless malice
1572085 you ought to know we military types dont care for pussy footing around we prefer that someone plainly speak whats on their mind
1572086 in any case what i meant was only people like that would or could misconstrue what you said as an attack on senator mccains patriotism
1572087 i was impugning his foreign policy and leadership experience not his bravery hell the mans too brave for his own good everybody knows that same as with the thing i said about how he never really commanded a combat squadron he was always bragging about that the squadron command but he was never ever honest enough to point out that the squadron didnt engage in combat when he commanded it really now
1572088 what kind of straight talk is that supposed to be
1572089 does being held captive and tortured by the evil north vietnamese constitute more foreign policy qualification than being shot four times by the evil vietcong
1572090 but i am pretty sure that neither of them entitles a public figure whether hes a united states senator or a retired united states army general to sing bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb iran during any kind of appearance in front of the press what if mccain gets elected and pulls another stunt like that remember how all bent out of shape the soviets got when reagan made that stupid comment about nuking russia during a sound check he didnt think was being broadcast
1572091 that nearly started world war iii or maybe world war iv depending on how you count them
1572092 you cant make rational substantive points discussing the issues in a national presidential campaign anymore people have to face the fact that although mccains a hero being a hero isnt the point look at eisenhower was he qualified to be president and oversee us foreign policy because of how brave he was or because he was the supreme allied commanding general and therefore someone who understood both the military and the political aspects of foreign policy
1572093 that its a positive thing for a candidate to be a veteran but unless they were at least a general or an admiral their experience in the political aspects of foreign policy issues is likely to be no more extensive than the average civilians
1572094 certainly not on the strategic level at which the president is expected to function
1572095 by any chance that you guys on the ground didnt always get the best air support from fellows like mccain is it
1572096 everybody knew the navy and air force pilots were chicken to fly close ground air support for the grunts like me and my boys but who could blame them most of their jets were designed to fight the russians during a nuclear war in eastern europe and only had missiles no machine guns no cannons and no close ground air support training either plus
1572097 the vietnamese were pretty good with their aa and if one of those guys did get shot down he knew hed be much better off in the hanoi hilton than back at hq explaining how hed managed to lose a very big very expensive jet fighter bomber torching and exploding people who everybody in the pentagon and the white house for that matter was convinced amounted to no more than little guys in pajamas and sandals who lived in the friggin stone age
1572098 especially after you finish your hitch and try using your military experience to get a decent paying white collar job with benefits regular hours and no heavy lifting like president of the united states
1572099 over two hundred miles in the worst snowstorm the state of ohio has seen in six decades
1572100 suggesting that senator clinton would drink a bucket of warm spit
1572101 and probably real old like forty or something too everybody knows people that old cant expletive anymore and you all have to walk around wearing adult diapers and expletive your sic just scared of how smart we young dudes are and how we know all about computers and mobile phones and expletive like that you dont no nothing sic about
1572102 that four great nations flushed with victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that power has ever paid to reason
1572103 96 percent of the residents who used to live in the old qianmen area featuring poor public works serious safety problems and dilapidated housing were pleased with the upgrading project in the area and the solutions offered to rehouse them
1572104 police officers did not interfere but women who said they were members of a neighborhood committee pushed and led the protesters away from the area
1572105 for whom is the leyte gulf landing celebration for anyway

1572118 there were four palestinians who were issued visas about whom we then received additional information
1572119 we decided that we needed to take a closer and harder look at them in light of the additional information we received

1572126 the life of the law has not been logic it has been experience the felt necessities of the time the prevalent moral and political theories institutions of public policy avowed or unconscious even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow men have had a good deal more to do than the syllogism in determining the rules by which men should be governed the law embodies the story of a nations development through many centuries and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics
1572127 states become laboratories for democracy and experiment with different kinds of laws

1572151 despite difficult economic conditions in the u s our ebitda from continuing operations improved by 1 2 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the same period last year this improvement was primarily due to improved results at gulfstream park santa anita park and our real estate operations partially offset by disappointing results at the maryland jockey club we are also encouraged by the results at xpressbet r which increased its handle by 21 and remington park which increased its slot revenues by 17 both compared to the same quarter last year notwithstanding this modest improvement in ebitda for the quarter we recognize the need for further significant improvement in our operating results as we also focus on dramatically reducing our debt levels
1572152 although we continue to take steps to implement our debt elimination plan u s real estate and credit markets have continued to demonstrate weakness in 2008 and we do not expect to complete our plan on the originally contemplated time schedule however we remain firmly committed to reducing debt and interest expense we closed the sale of great lakes downs in july 2008 and are continuing to pursue other asset sale opportunities

1572207 allowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction it is the opposite we believe it is a form of harm addition
1572208 safe injecting sites are not a new intervention but simply a repackaging of existing who recommended interventions such as needle exchanges etc
1572209 they enable known who recommended harm reduction interventions to be delivered and used in a safe environment with the aim of reaching the most marginalized and vulnerable of injecting drug users
1572210 canada is proud to be the largest contributor to the who
1572211 we need to stop arguing about the merits of harm reduction and just do it
1572212 it may seem like they are legalizing heroin and other drugs which they are not
1572213 it is high time every country in the world resolutely embraced the full spectrum of harm reduction among injecting drug users not doing so will only perpetuate the spread of hiv

1572218 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
1572219 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1572220 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1572221 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1572222 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1572223 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1572224 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs

1572304 for me as a representative of the people of phuket who joined the conference today i cant deny that this is a good project
1572305 but dasta should announce that all of phuket province is a designated area and it should inform more people such as villagers and people who live here in phuket so they know about this project widely instead of just the hundreds of people here who have joined the conference
1572306 because this project is really quite a big project dasta should open the stage to dialogue with people in phuket
1572307 it should talk about what dasta is how dasta will be a participant in joining to develop phuket it should talk about what dasta is going to do to develop phuket and whether things in phuket are going to change these things will make people understand dasta should open a broad dialogue so that the project can move on i believe that if people understand the objectives of the project and if most people agree with dasta the project can move on
1572308 phuket people like me arent against the project as it stands
1572309 as a representative of phuket i knew about dasta and the project but many people were not informed about it and about this public hearing today dasta should explain the advantages of this project and even the disadvantages of the project if you dont tell the people about the project they might protest against it and the project might collapse or fail like many projects that people dont understand
1572310 for me personally i agree with continuing this project but i prefer to develop all of phuket province to solve the larger problems phuket has as well
1572311 we may be moving too fast like many people said so we will hold conferences to listen to the voices from people in phuket
1572312 we want to make the people trust the ao phuket project and dasta
1572313 i firmly believe that this project will be absolutely useful for people who live in phuket
1572314 if phuket is approved as a designated area we will have to do more research and study the effects carefully and clearly to earn the trust of the phuket people and the confidence of the companies who invest in thailand the lingering problems of phuket such as traffic jams garbage and air pollution will be reduced and well be able to solve other problems faster as well

1572322 i dont know who he has spoken to in tampa im presuming it was jon gruden and he decided to go ahead and speak with the jets we think the bucs are the logical team one of the things that was getting in the way here was that the packers were it appeared that the packers were asking for more compensation from the bucs than the jets which is in a way trying to control where hes going
1572323 when favre first said he wanted to come back his position was i want to play football for the green bay packers

1572349 i miei homers comincio a prepararli durante la settimana lavorando duro perch in allenamento che prepari la mente a vincere le partite
1572350 cercher cercheremo di fare tutto quello che abbiamo fatto nella regular season continueremo a concentrarci intensamente gara per gara giocare duro per vincere una partita alla volta questo stato il segreto della nostra ottima regular season
1572351 vorrei avere una risposta ma la risposta non ce lho sono stato sette anni in independent league crescendo stagione dopo stagione non so il motivo perch non sono andato salito pi in alto comunque sono contento di giocare qui e di essere utile alla fortitudo poi la speranza rimane la speranza che qualcosa dimportante succeda e di venir chiamato a giocare in una lega dalto livello
1572352 sicuramente si gioca ad un buon livello confrontandolo con la northern league e la frontier league dove ho giocato io per nella mia mente c baseball e baseball comunque lo giochi la differenza sta dove si gioca di pi e dove si gioca di meno venendo in italia mi sono trovato nella necessit di adattarmi cio mi sono dovuto abituare a giocare tre partite la settimana anzich tutti i giorni comero abituato a fare prima il problema per uno straniero pu essere quello pi che il livello del gioco ho capito le differenze e penso di essermi adattato abbastanza bene
1572353 il primo quello che ho realizzato allo stadio di parma il 25 aprile al sesto inning un fuoricampo da 2 punti perch ricordo particolarmente volentieri questo innanzitutto perch era in campo opposto a sinistra io sono un mancino in battuta e poi perch era il primo che facevo in una lega nuova per me in una squadra nuova con compagni nuovi mi ha dato emozioni particolari
1572354 mi ha messo in difficolt con i suoi lanci e la sua classe giovanni carrara be lui ha anche un passato prestigioso in linea di massima comunque so cosa fare contro i lanciatori del campionato italiano grazie soprattutto ai miei compagni che mi illustrano le caratteristiche di ogni pitcher e cos sono sempre preparato
1572355 la concentrazione comincia prima io osservo attentamente ogni turno in battuta dei miei compagni di squadra per capire il lanciatore dal dugout mentalmente mi immedesimo in un mio compagno e penso lancio dopo lancio a cosa farei io in quel momento
1572356 no non faccio niente di particolare per imporre la mia personalit o la mia fisicit una cosa che sicuramente utile colpire la palla forte con notevole aggressivit nei primi turni di battuta questo pu servire per condizionare un po il lanciatore per togliergli qualcosa sul piano della serenit del coraggio non uso atteggiamenti provocatori non mi piace il pitcher ha la palla in mano e va rispettato cerco di intimidirlo con la mia sicurezza un battitore deve sempre sentirsi sicuro
1572357 uno dei concetti fondamentali della battuta che se non hai fiducia in te stesso non puoi battere bene n forte la fiducia laspetto pi importante forse non si vede ma quando io vado in battuta ho la fiducia di poter battere qualsiasi lancio
1572358 la preparazione mentale comincia in allenamento durante la settimana lavorando forte sia sulla battuta sia sulla difesa quando sei in partita tutto deve venire in modo molto istintivo vuol dire che hai preparato bene le cose hai curato ogni dettaglio dobbiamo allenare la mente in allenamento giorno dopo giorno per poi essere in grado di vincere le partite
1572359 la famiglia la mia famiglia negli stati uniti la sento tutti i giorni mi d un supporto importante aiutandomi ad avere sempre un atteggiamento positivo

1572377 i was happy to see for the first time i have ever seen since i have been involved in the rebuilding of lower manhattan that people actually said no there were some emphatic nods and that is the right answer because one of the things that has stymied the rebuilding process has been too many platitudes and too many unrealistic deadlines

1572426 that they live as if they will never die and die as though they had never lived
1572427 as a parent what are some of lifes lessons you want your children to learn
1572428 to learn they cannot make anyone love them all they can do is let themselves be loved
1572429 to learn that it is not good to compare themselves to others
1572430 to learn that it only takes a few seconds to open profound wounds in those they love and it can take many years to heal them
1572431 to learn that a rich person is not one who has the most but is one who needs the least
1572432 to learn that there are people who love them dearly but simply have not yet learned how to express or show their feelings
1572433 to learn that two people can look at the same thing and see it differently
1572434 to learn that it is not enough that they forgive one another but they must also forgive themselves
1572435 is there anything else you would like your children to know

1572440 we talked about everything that has happened since this whole process started
1572441 we rehashed all the different things thats gone on we agreed and disagreed our whole focus was was he a member of our football team and where was his mind at he was not at the proper mindset to be part of our football team
1572442 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1572443 i understand the attention he gets for being in his position i think that he has the tools mentally physically emotionally whos had better training than aaron rodgers in being an nfl qb i believe in aaron because hes very talented
1572444 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1572445 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1572446 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1572447 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1572448 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1572449 i just know we were out at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter
1572450 everything went kind of sour a few weeks or a month back but you never felt like it would get to the point or to the talks of him actually being traded
1572451 i felt once he stepped back in here he would be the quarterback him not being here today i guess management has a different route so at that point weve got to go out and do our job

1572481 tidak dihalalkan bagi seseorang untuk berpegang pada perkataan kami selagi ia tidak mengetahui dari mana kami mengambilnya
1572482 adalah haram bagi orang yang tidak mengetahui alasanku untuk memberikan fatwa dengan perkataanku
1572483 sesungguhnya kami adalah manusia yang mengatakan perkataan pada hari ini dan meralatnya di esok hari
1572484 jika aku mengatakan suatu perkataan yang bertentangan dengan kitab allah dan kabar rasulullah salallahu alaihi wa sallam maka tinggalkanlah perkataanku
1572485 sesungguhnya aku ini hanyalah seorang manusia yang salah dan benar maka perhatikanlah pendapatku setiap pendapat yang sesuai dengan kitab dan sunnah ambillah dan setiap yang tidak sesuai dengan al kitab dan sunnah tinggalkanlah
1572486 tidak ada seorang pun setelah nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam kecuali dari perkataannya itu ada yang diambil dan yang ditinggalkan kecuali nabi salallhu alaihi wasallam
1572487 aku mendengar bahwa malik ditanya tentang menyelang nyelangi jari di dalam berwudhu lalu dia berkata
1572488 aku melihat rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam menunjukkan kepadaku dengan kelingkingnya apa yang ada diantara jari jari kedua kakinya
1572489 sesungguhnya hadist ini adalah hasan aku mendengarnya hanya satu jam kemudian aku mendengarnya setelah itu ditanya lalu ia memerintahkan untuk menyelang nyelangi jari jari mukaddimah al jarhu wat tadil karya ibnu abi hatim hal 32 33
1572490 tidak ada seorangpun kecuali dia harus bermadzab dengan sunnah rasulullah dan menyendiri dengannya walaupun aku mengucapkan satu ucapan dan mengasalkan kepada suatu asal di dalamnya dari rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam yang bertentangan dengan ucapanku maka peganglah sabda rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam inilah ucapanku
1572491 kaum muslimin telah sepakat bahwa barang siapa yang telah terang baginya sunnah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam maka tidak halal baginya untuk meninggalkannya karena untuk mengikuti perkataan seseorang
1572492 apabila kamu mendapatkan di dalam kitabku apa yang bertentangan dengan sunnah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam maka berkatalah dengan sunnah rasulullah salallahu alaihi wa sallam dan tinggalkanlah apa yang aku katakan
1572493 kamu imam ahmad lebih tahu dari padaku tentang hadist dan orang orangnya rijalu l hadits apabila hadist itu shahih maka ajarkanlah ia kepadaku apapun ia adanya baik ia dari kufah bashrah maupun dari syam sehingga apabila ia shahih akan bermadzhab dengannya
1572494 setiap masalah yang didalamnya kabar dari rasulullah salallahu alaihi wasallam adalah shahih bagi ahli naqli dan bertentangan dengan apa yang aku katakan maka aku meralatnya di dalam hidupku dan setelah aku mati
1572495 apabila kamu melihat aku mengatakan suatu perkataan sedangkan hadist nabi yang bertentangan dengannya shahih maka ketahuilah sesungguhnya akalku telah bermadzhab dengannya
1572496 janganlah engkau mengikuti aku dan jangan pula engkau mengikuti malik syafii auzai dan tsauri tapi ambillah dari mana mereka mengambil
1572497 pendapat auzai pendapat malik dan pendapat abu hanifah semuanya adalah pendapat dan ia bagiku adalah sama sedangkan alasan hanyalah terdapat di dalam atsar atsar
1572498 barang siapa yang menolak hadits rasulullah salallahu alaihi wa sallam maka sesungguhnya ia telah berada di tepi kehancuran
1572499 maka demi tuhanmu mereka pada hakekatnya tidak beriman hingga mereka menjadikan kamu hakim terhadap perkara yang mereka perselisihkan kemudian mereka tidak merasa dalam hati mereka sesuatu keberatan terhadap putusan yang kamu berikan dan mereka menerima dengan sepenuhnya
1572500 maka hendaklah orang orang yang menyalahi perintah nya takut akan ditimpa cobaan atau ditimpa adzab yang pedih
1572501 adalah menjadi kewajiban bagi setiap orang yang telah sampai kepadanya perintah rasulullah salallahu alaihi wa sallam dan mengetahuinya untuk menerangkannya kepada umat menasehati mereka dan memerintahkan kepada mereka untuk mengikuti perintahnya dan apabila hal itu bertentangan dengan pendapat orang besar diantara umat maka sesungguhnya perintah rasulullah salallahu alaihi wa sallam itu lebih berhak untuk disebarkan dan diikuti dibanding pendapat orang besar manapun yang telah bertentangan dengan perintahnya di dalam sebagian perkara secara salah dan dari sini para sahabat dan orang orang setelah mereka telah menolak setiap orang yang menentang sunnah yang sahih dan barangkali mereka telah berlaku keras dalam penolakan ini namun demikian mereka tidak membencinya bahkan dia dicintai dan diagungkan di dalam hati mereka akan tetapi rasulullah salallahu alaihi wa sallam adalah lebih dicintai oleh mereka dan perintahnya melebihi setiap makhluk lainnya oleh karena itu apabila perintah rasul itu bertentangan dengan perintah selainnya maka perintah rasul adalah lebih utama untuk didahulukan dan diikuti hal ini tidak dihalang halangi oleh pengagungan terhadap orang yang bertentangan dengan perintahnya walaupun orang itu mendapat ampunan orang yang bertentangan itu tidak membenci apabila perintahnya itu diingkari apabila memang ternyata perintah rasulullah itu bertentangan dengannya bagaimana mungkin mereka akan membenci hal itu sedangkan mereka telah memerintahkan kepada para pengikutnya dan mereka telah mewajibkan mereka untuk meninggalkan perkataan perkataan yang bertentangan dengan sunnah

1572523 what is considered proper handling when you have non scientologist relatives who maintain a civil relationship with the sp and what happens with family functions like holidays weddings etc do you just not go there if the sp is going to be there

1572532 the church is right our grandma is a suppressive person and mom would be better if she disconnected from her after all you guys got in that car accident after having thanksgiving with her this is tough love i am practicing i am right why cant you see that
1572533 the thing is in my viewpoint whether or not the church more specifically the maas justices etc is right about what a survival choice for all is

1572545 911 programs medal of valor i sent something off to the church nevertheless
1572546 that makes it a little more clear that its an award from the 9 11 program the private charity not the fdny medal of valor but its still a pretty confusing speech though as parts of it read like its supposed to sound like the fdny gave the award instead of a charity maybe that dude just sucks at public speaking
1572547 911 programs medal of valor and 9 11 service award
1572548 800 volunteer ministers earned praise from officials and civic leaders and were awarded the new york fire departments medal of valor

1572551 where are rons other children like diana and arthur among others i hear some are in int management and what ever happened to mary sue after she went down for her actions with the go thing
1572552 wikipedia still has under the freewinds article that the ship is still sealed up then again wikipedia has a lot of false data lol
1572553 also what right has hittman who does seem to be a prominent scioentologist i saw the pix of him with jenna elman the year before this fiasco
1572554 what right has he to do or say anything on behalf of fdny having been forced to resign from fdny 2 years earlier
1572555 i have a few serious questions i feel very hesitant to even ask because this forum seems acrimonious but none the less here goes
1572556 sites like wikipedia appear to be very neutral i honestly dont think you can categorize online encyclopedias as anti scientology sites wikipedia has articles on operation freakout and operation snow white which include documents detailing the plans would you regard these information pages as either the half truths or dramatized stories you refer to on your myth pages
1572557 you say that the plan was canceled before it reached church officials are members of the guardians office not church officials
1572558 in regards to lisa mcpherson perhaps she did not lose 40 lbs but there are clearly sores all over her body
1572559 why would her friends allow what appears to be neglect
1572560 it just seems as if there is a huge gap between was is written on the online encyclopedias and this site
1572561 if it was from the auto accident then why would the doctors let her go immediately
1572562 i realize i might be jumping to conclusions in assuming the cuts came from the auto accident but reasonably where else could they have come from

1572565 self analysis is it supposed to be techiques similar to dianetics that one can apply to her himself specifically solo
1572566 also do you know of anyone who uses used that book effectively if that is its purpose

1572569 wah yes white men are so hard done by motherfucker
1572570 the center fielder almost caught it so well take what we can get
1572571 im not going to look a gift horse in the mouth thats one of the most interesting plays i think youll ever see
1572572 while i was running to second i watched the whole thing transpire it was kind of weird because everything is happening that fast all at once you cant really tell whats going on and youre just waiting for it to end to really take a look the ball rolled on the wall for 10 feet and he came in and pulled down the offensive board it was even more amazing to see it on the replay
1572573 i should have caught the ball it hit in the pocket of my glove ross did a great job he jumped up and grabbed it
1572574 the biggest thing is you look around and nobody is counting on you to be that guy
1572575 youre just a complementary piece of that puzzle since ive been here ive had two guys on base every second or third time i get up there thats a testament to the lineup
1572576 just coming over here im trying to be comfortable and trying not to do too much i think thats probably helped simplify it obviously some success early helps you relax a little bit
1572577 anytime you have two pitches you can throw for strikes it makes it tough
1572578 i had a good fastball and a good curveball i cant pinpoint one pitch i got more outs with
1572579 i was just trying to keep it close and get to our good bullpen guys
1572580 what about the guy getting suspended on a night when ive got to face beckett
1572581 calentamiento global proyecto pascua lama que mierda est pasando con ste mundo con la gente con la vida
1572582 i think the consensus of opinion was that he wasnt given an adequate opportunity to prepare himself to come here
1572583 the guys been snake bitten somewhat because of a variety of things that have happened to him and i think everybodys very much aware of his history
1572584 its not something that i would do unless it was an emergency situation
1572585 i think hes one of the best right fielders in the big leagues so why move him from there
1572586 but something else surprised me how much you can love an adopted child the same as you can love a biological child i didnt anticipate that
1572587 just a trim i want it healthy ive been in the pool all summer yada yada yada
1572588 massive resistance to the desegregation of schools was symbolized most dramatically by arkansas governor orval faubus order that his states national guard unit block the admission of nine african american students to little rocks central high school in 1957 the nearly month long confrontation ended when president eisenhower sent in u s troops to protect the students

1572607 listening to radio is stronger than it has ever been
1572608 but were in a difficult economy and one of the first things companies will cut is their advertising budget more and more dollars are going to the internet
1572609 i believe it will be a growth driver into the future its also part of our diversification strategy because ultimately i believe our future is in being a black media and content company and not just a radio company
1572610 were exploring what options there are to match up the latino sites with a network of other latino sites
1572611 were a black media company at the end of the day
1572612 everything we have thats not black targeted is up for discussion
1572613 what this organization is all about is balancing among the different missions
1572614 we thought that was the right judgment to make given the information we had at that point in time
1572615 we decided to give up market share rather than to chase it
1572616 when the entire marketplace is seeing things one way we cant unilaterally say were going to see things another way
1572617 after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another
1572618 remember that when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this
1572619 obama told a crowd at a gym in youngstown ohio
1572620 john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1572621 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it
1572622 people care not only what you say but how you vote
1572623 his schedule hasnt been set for next week let alone next month
1572624 americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened
1572625 cases like this send a clear message to those who might be tempted to abuse our computer networks to steal information and harm law abiding people and businesses if you do we will track you down wherever you are in the world we will arrest you and we will send you to jail
1572626 millions of americans have had their identities compromised each year
1572627 the annual costs to american citizens and businesses are in the billions
1572628 this was a big deal that they finally proved its all linked

1572633 our hope has always been that the customers would be able to purchase the homes from the bank
1572634 there are a lot of builders having issues especially smaller builders who are wrestling with cash flow and still trying to build houses
1572635 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1572636 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1572637 the era of u s funded major infrastructure projects is over
1572638 accurately highlights that iraqs revenues have grown substantially in recent years
1572639 still needs to improve the speed and effectiveness of its budget execution and the transparency of its budgeting and accounting practices
1572640 we estimate that the iraqi government could spend between 35 3 billion and 35 9 billion of its overall 49 9 billion budget
1572641 i was not surprised but i certainly was grateful for his and his familys efforts
1572642 i have a lot of arab business partners i do a lot of business in the middle east ive got a lot of friends
1572643 i ask my friends to support candidates that i think are worthy of supporting they usually come through for me
1572644 anderson did not stop or seize any of the messages that were forwarded to him
1572645 andersons actions did not halt the transmission of the messages to their intended recipients as such under well settled case law as well as a reading of the statute and the ordinary meaning of the word intercept andersons acquisitions of the e mails did not violate the wiretap act
1572646 the information was obtained in a legal manner from a confidential informant who we believe obtained the information legally
1572647 the case is alarming because its implications will reach far beyond a single civil case
1572648 law enforcement officers could engage in the contemporaneous acquisition of e mails just as anderson did without having to comply with the wiretap acts requirements
1572649 internet service providers could intercept and use the private communications of their customers with no concern about liability
1572650 the government could go to your internet service provider and say copy all of your e mail but make the copy a millisecond after the email arrives and it would not be a wiretap
1572651 the main focus of the campaign is that we dont believe these companies should be assisting the chinese government to censor the internet from its citizens
1572652 the campaign is to end internet censorship in china but focusing specifically on companies that are internationally recognised and people around the world to say that we expect more from those companies
1572653 these are clear indications that these companies arent aware of what their corporate and social responsibilities are
1572654 theyre the kinds of things that many customers dont know about and are clear ways where the companies could stop assisting the chinese government in censoring its citizens
1572655 i dont like to do it on the road but i wouldnt be afraid to
1572656 could you make me a samurai sword not a fake one but a real one
1572657 can we make a three level tree house with an elevator and a big screen tv

1572664 open up new marketing opportunities and help promote the wales brand
1572665 this announcement reflects a more strategic approach to put wales on the world map and enhance welsh culture and identity on the worldwide web
1572666 there is little evidence to suggest that a cym domain will have substantial short term economic benefit for wales
1572667 the internet is the e engine for economic growth and wales needs top level access to deliver the innovation that we need
1572668 the internet is about to change radically and wales must be fully on board the new internet with a top level domain identity cym on a par with other economically growing communities
1572669 most of our customers come from london the south east and scotland but for tourist companies its a great idea
1572670 i think it offers another option for businesses to consider which is never a bad thing
1572671 for companies for which welshness is a key part of their proposition to their customers it maybe a useful marketing tool

1572674 because right now my season with just two wins is just ok but if i were able to come through on sunday and win this event it would make an ok year a great one
1572675 but i was so glad that i was in a position to compete for the championship to get back into contention to have an opportunity where every putt counted and put myself in a pressure situation heading into the pga
1572676 senator obama has said expanding our nuclear power plants quote doesnt make sense for america unquote
1572677 he also says no to nuclear storage and no to nuclear processing i could not disagree more
1572678 supports safe and clean nuclear energy however before an expansion of nuclear power is considered obama thinks key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
1572679 i saw senator obamas latest attack has to do with oil and campaign contributions
1572680 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it people care not only what you say but how you vote
1572681 it is striking the difference of perspective between the united states and many other countries
1572682 i think because of the politics around immigration more broadly the fact that mr medellin is mexican rather than swedish does make a difference
1572683 it certainly does play into a bigger debate and bigger fears that many people have about immigration from mexico
1572684 i was not surprised but i certainly was grateful for his and his familys efforts
1572685 i have a lot of arab business partners i do a lot of business in the middle east ive got a lot of friends
1572686 i ask my friends to support candidates that i think are worthy of supporting they usually come through for me
1572687 sometimes for the better good of the whole some parts have to be sacrificed because somewhere down the line everybody has to realize there are consequences for their actions
1572688 les guste o no nuestra solidaridad les ha permitido superarnos a los catalanes en calidad de vida y es de malnacidos no reconocerlo
1572689 was well received there were about 25 people in attendance and despite the short time for questions there were some good ones i enjoyed delivering the presentation and it was filmed for later publication on
1572690 broadening and rising higher and higher from a boundless basis
1572691 we hugged a deal with nintendo for prince of persia
1572692 what i do seem to see is a surge in the phenomenon we saw a decade or so ago of random violent behavior that doesnt seem to have anything to do with the gangs but with disorderly youth that are acting out in a much more aggressive way than weve seen in a while
1572693 while this doesnt rise to the level case of the central park jogger where the terms wilding and feral youth were bandied about in new york in some ways it has some of the same flavor to it
1572694 they put a bag on our stoop with stuff on the bottom of it i dont want to get too graphic on the radio but it was dog feces we think and they lit it on fire and ran
1572695 i know theyre kids but kids that do that sort of thing in my opinion get worse down the road
1572696 hopefully parents can put a stop to that before it happens and say hey this is not the right sort of thing to do
1572697 as long as we lived around here ive never heard anything like that before that kind of worries you or bothers you theyve had trouble over there but not like that its usually amongst themselves they dont pick on a guy walking around the lake
1572698 its good to get all the neighbors together and allow everyone to get to know each other
1572699 we walk around the lake and its always been safe i go everywhere on the east side and im not afraid people always say arent you afraid im not i grew up here and its always been a strong community people have always helped each other and watched out for each other
1572700 smx is one of the strongest opportunities for networking and education available in the search marketing industry
1572701 that our seo training has been invited to be an official
1572702 my mom is a good dog walker she has a great shoe collection but she doesnt like it when i chew on them
1572703 im cleaning out my basement and im going to sell you all the junk that i dont want anymore
1572704 because the people come to me to seek gods will whenever they have a dispute it is brought to me and i decide between the parties and inform them of gods decrees and laws
1572705 what you are doing is not good you and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out the work is too heavy for you you cannot handle it alone listen now to me and i will give you some advice and may god be with you you must be the peoples representative before god and bring their disputes to him teach them the decrees and laws and show them the way to live and the duties they are to perform but select capable men from all the people men who fear god trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain and appoint them as officials over thousands hundreds fifties and tens have them serve as judges for the people at all times but have them bring every difficult case to you the simple cases they can decide themselves that will make your load lighter because they will share it with you if you do this and god so commands you will be able to stand the strain and all these people will go home satisfied
1572706 what you are doing is not good you and these people who come to you will only wear themselves out
1572707 please jethro lets put in a word for this worn out momma
1572708 out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks
1572709 understood that this extended to things like downloadable content and online play
1572710 my mom is a good dog walker she has a great shoe collection but she doesnt like it when i chew on them
1572711 im cleaning out my basement and im going to sell you all the junk that i dont want anymore
1572712 due to hip injuries and now my shoulder the time has come where injuries have got the better of me and it is time to move on
1572713 i had an interrupted pre season and i ended up stewing on this decision pretty much all year
1572714 once i reached the decision the realisation was quite overwhelming to be able to just sit and watch the boys in the derby at the weekend knowing that i was on the sidelines was actually quite a relief
1572715 the camaraderie and those times at training and at the club when you are just hanging with your mates thats what ill miss most
1572716 it is never an easy decision for any player to reach
1572717 it is important to acknowledge the contribution that heath has made to the fremantle football club and the sacrifices he had made as a footballer during his time at the club
1572718 without doubt id keep him hes 25 i think hes their best player by a mile
1572719 i dont condone what hes done but i would keep him why wouldnt you
1572720 theres 15 other clubs that would chase him and why are they any better to think that they could probably straighten him out
1572721 these players are so educated that has really shocked me theyve been just told and told and told
1572722 dids has ended up having to face the music over the last couple of years and unfortunately hes in that boat at the moment
1572723 whos more to blame in this instance the guy driving or the passenger is he guilty by association
1572724 he got into the car i understand he was in the wrong place at the wrong time but in the end if there was blame to be put on here i know who id be spanking moreso than the other
1572725 theres 15 other clubs that would take him on tomorrow and the ones that wouldnt take him on its because they couldnt probably provide the proper trade to get him across the line
1572726 that sized player and type player weve got plenty of so i think if were looking for a player from another club it would have to fit our needs or maybe some hole weve got in the team
1572727 without doubt id keep him hes 25 i think hes their best player by a mile
1572728 i dont condone what hes done but i would keep him why wouldnt you
1572729 theres 15 other clubs that would chase him and why are they any better to think that they could probably straighten him out
1572730 these players are so educated that has really shocked me theyve been just told and told and told
1572731 dids has ended up having to face the music over the last couple of years and unfortunately hes in that boat at the moment
1572732 whos more to blame in this instance the guy driving or the passenger is he guilty by association
1572733 he got into the car i understand he was in the wrong place at the wrong time but in the end if there was blame to be put on here i know who id be spanking moreso than the other
1572734 theres 15 other clubs that would take him on tomorrow and the ones that wouldnt take him on its because they couldnt probably provide the proper trade to get him across the line
1572735 we have the wood and the fire father but where is the lamb for the burnt offering
1572736 god will provide for himself the lamb for the burnt offering
1572737 come here my boy this is where we will offer our sacrifice
1572738 it gives our police officers the protection they need to be able to make the point that this is serious and that we dont want these things flying through public parks where someone could be blinded
1572739 its just like somebody taking your father away thats what it is to me
1572740 we really need to get the community involved everybody needs to get involved
1572741 theres good people that get up every day and go to work
1572742 i hope that it got people thinking i hope the grey matter started turning on and lighting up and started thinking we gotta do something dont sell your house dont run away from the problem i dont care where you are
1572743 the kid was confused but hes very relieved and well see how he comes through this ordeal
1572744 its another part of footy its a learning curve for him but he was very confused and bewildered by it because he thought hed done nothing wrong it was a great result
1572745 i think the result showed that steven was unfortunate to be in the wrong place at the wrong time
1572746 but i can see the point of view of the tribunal and the match review panel a player gets hit in the head and then especially with the bruising on the brain i think the afl as they did should look at it very seriously because the head is a sacred area and we need to look after that
1572747 if you stripped my track down you could hear the birds in the background
1572748 no on 8 campaign in lieu of gifts so instead of pulling up a wedding registry at macys friends and family can go online and give a donation in honor of the couple to a registry sponsored by gay rights organizations
1572749 no on 8 campaign so far donations in honor of about 1 400 couples have generated approximately 300 000 for the campaign
1572750 there it is and we start at about this elevation
1572751 oh dont worry we dont climb here we climb around the back
1572752 we better not be doing any thing like this on our backpacking trip
1572753 dang it fine you can pass me but i am going to keep up
1572754 im walking in the house im walking in the house ahhh
1572755 look they are hungry they are waiting for me to come feed them
1572756 w hrend wir gleichzeitig genauso ihre klare antwort auf unsere fragen und zweifel erwarten
1572757 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
1572758 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
1572759 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
1572760 real results by the end of my first term in office
1572761 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1572762 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
1572763 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
1572764 the reign of charlemagne was greatly aided by a general improvement in the weather during the eight and ninth centuries
1572765 we need to be able to address a national energy strategy and then try to work on environmental efficiencies as part of that plan
1572766 we cant just start with things like emission standards at a time when were at a crisis with the entire national energy policy
1572767 there was not enough emphasis that if we move aggressively toward sustainable energy we will transform our energy costs
1572768 we were not as clear as we might have been
1572769 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
1572770 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
1572771 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
1572772 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
1572773 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
1572774 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
1572775 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
1572776 it looks like its going slow but theres a lot of torque generated which can make the gears go faster
1572777 on the low end 30 mph wind could generate about 500 watts
1572778 when he was growing up i was cleaning up his room and i remember finding this thing that looked like a bomb
1572779 i dont know how he learned but he knows how
1572780 he knows how to build everything hes always on the computer reading about how things work
1572781 he first got interested in physics and then when we went to louisiana he got interested in meteorology
1572782 continuing strength in international markets coupled with healthy demand in the united states helped drive higher worldwide sales of semiconductors in june
1572783 key demand drivers for semiconductors especially personal computers which account for 40 percent of semiconductor sales and mobile phones which drive about 20 percent of demand continued to show double digit unit growth
1572784 just hard enough to keep you on your toes and entertained but not too hard that youll stop playing
1572785 es gibt ein risiko f r die olympischen spiele aber deshalb haben wir hunderte pl ne ausgearbeitet
1572786 seine quote war fast besser als die eines st rmers
1572787 ich erwarte dass unsere mittelfeldspieler insgesamt produktiver werden wenn nicht dann haben wir ein problem
1572788 ich bin froh ihn zu haben er muss jetzt beweisen dass er ein kompletter spieler sein kann
1572789 einen typen wie ihn kann man nicht einfach ersetzen aber gerade beim emirates cup haben wir sehr gut gespielt man konnte auch die handschrift von martin jol erkennen wir haben versucht sehr schnell nach vorne zu spielen das sah teilweise sehr gut aus
1572790 ich finde frank tritt auf wie unser kapit n das wird auch so bleiben es wird noch einige gespr che mit den spielern geben dann wird man sehen was passiert
1572791 wir kennen den markt sind gut vorbereitet und in der position entscheidungen zu treffen hoffentlich klappt es
1572792 allerdings wurden wir was sehr ungew hnlich ist viel zu sp t informiert
1572793 wir bekamen die informationen erst am dienstag um 8 uhr
1572794 der wetterbericht hatte weniger windst rke vorausgesagt als letztlich auf offener see herrschte
1572795 weil wir nicht genau wussten wie weit der katamaran noch auf see war sind wir mit winde gestartet um notfalls verletzte ber ein seil an bord ziehen zu k nnen
1572796 weil wir zu sp t informiert wurden hoffen wir dass die notwendigen informationen in der black box noch aufgezeichnet sind
1572797 wir pr fen nun ob technische m ngel menschliches versagen und auch das schwere wetter zu dem unfall f hrten
1572798 ich kann mir beim besten willen nicht vorstellen dass da was war
1572799 wir hoffen dass wir mindestens zwei drittel der stellen erhalten k nnen
1572800 wir haben in der vergangenheit mehrfach hinweise bekommen nach denen in der unterkunft mit drogen gehandelt wird
1572801 bei der aktion konnten beim hauptt ter 55 gramm crack und 575 euro drogengeld sichergestellt werden
1572802 anders als in anderen l ndern gibt es bei uns keinen interventionsplan
1572803 das ist der schlechteste platz auf dem wir hier bisher trainiert haben
1572804 ich bin nicht amtsm de und es sind nicht altersgr nde die mich auf eine erneute kandidatur verzichten lassen
1572805 w re es davon bin ich berzeugt sicher zu sp t
1572806 zu besichtigen sind reaktion re illiberale feinde der offenen gesellschaft bei ihrem verbiesterten kampf gegen pluralit t und f r die ideologische reinheit des parteik rpers
1572807 hat diese entscheidung bestand wird aus der spd endg ltig eine andere partei weder links noch frei weder weltoffen noch gro z gig stattdessen autorit r und antiliberal verstockt und doktrin r boshaft und missg nstig
1572808 eines ist sicher anh nger der werte und ideen einer freiheitlichen und fortschrittlichen sozialen demokratie k nnten solch einer partei nicht angeh ren
1572809 mccain did not have a great week his visual was riding around in a golf cart with old george bush the first
1572810 shears report represents a major change in the mainstream press culture of the past sixteen years
1572811 he genuinely likes reporters hell joke with us about our drinking habits playfully request our cell phones in the middle of a call and tell some unsuspecting editor or parent that the phones owner has just been hauled off to rehab and engage in gleefully sarcastic banter about both our colleagues and his
1572812 does this mean you endorse using gas hogs and large mansions
1572813 a lot of environmental activists still have not come to accept that the humans are also part of the environment
1572814 we need your help to get this film into theatres and schools across the country to defeat al gores lies and exaggerations
1572815 not evil just wrong is the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
1572816 al gore has raised us 300 million to bombard the world with his message that all the energy in the us should be renewable in 10 years he is even running his ads during sponge bob square pants our children are watching this propaganda and are being forced to watch
1572817 please help us as much as you can to get this film out now
1572818 give me the money and ill be right back with the dope
1572819 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
1572820 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
1572821 my heart goes out to the families of the victims as well as to the community and the whole u p i was raised in the up and i know how much we yoopers value the serenity and safety that goes with living there when i was a kid we didnt even have a lock on our front door it wasnt needed and were not talking that long ago this kind of senseless act will bring the community together but will also leave scars that will make people think twice about their safety
1572822 i demand to know where al gore is declaring that this rise in the lake levels is all just media bunk and that were all still doomed because of global warming
1572823 he wants to tax oil companies profits which will raise the price of gas and use the money to help motorist pay for the more expensive gas is this robbing peter to pay peter
1572824 like any dog this breed needs to be matched with the right owner i dont know much about this specific owner or the circumstances but pit bulls are often a thugged out status symbol and are not given the assertive leadership they require heck it may have to come to the point where one needs to be licensed to own certain breeds banning them may only increase their mystique and status amongst those ill equipped to care for them
1572825 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
1572826 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will cause in the future catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
1572827 an overwhelming number of scientists have determined that catastrophic manmade global warming is real and that any further debate over the science is pointless
1572828 marketed not on the basis of science its about what is known or what can be proved about the natural world rather than the number of scientists who are willing to publicly commit to a particular opinion
1572829 an overwhelming number of scientists they are referring to scientists working under the auspices of the u n s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc that agrees man made greenhouse gas emissions are or will in the future wreak havoc on the climate
1572830 head counts of scientists seem to be the name of the global warming game
1572831 the white house has taken a beating over the years in the press on climate and facts no longer matter
1572832 the latest move was to list the polar bear as an endangered species
1572833 there are many more polar bears today than 40 years ago and predictions of the bears demise are entirely based on politically inspired speculation
1572834 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect other countries to say ok
1572835 regulate the pantries of america as well as thermostats and modes of personal transportation mccain and the bush administration are drinking the same kool aid the initial response from the bush administration to relevant new facts seems to be see no consensus hear no consensus speak no consensuses
1572836 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
1572837 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
1572838 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
1572839 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
1572840 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
1572841 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1572842 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
1572843 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
1572844 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1572845 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
1572846 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1572847 das ist eine schwerwiegende verletzung der f rsorgepflicht des staates
1572848 in der verordnung steht dass vom trinkwasser keine gesundheitliche gef hrdung ausgehen darf
1572849 s mtliche gesundheitsausgaben die unmittelbar mit einer medizinischen heilbehandlung verbunden sind
1572850 viele christdemokratische positionen aufgegeben und sich als kanzlerin st rker mit der politik der gro en koalition identifiziert
1572851 wir haben bei der letzten bundestagswahl eben keine mehrheit f r eine solche politik bekommen
1572852 ich kann diese pauschalkritik von herrn schlarmann so nicht akzeptieren
1572853 wir k nnen in einer gro en koalition nicht cdu pur machen
1572854 herr schlarmann sollte kein sommerlochthema aufmachen sondern lieber mithelfen dass wir n chstes jahr die bundestagswahl gewinnen und mit der fdp ein b ndnis eingehen k nnen
1572855 die politik der gro en koalition vergrault die w hler das werden die gro en parteien bei der bundestagswahl sicher zu sp ren bekommen
1572856 unsere performance ist weltklasse insbesondere wenn man die schwierigen gesamtwirtschaftlichen bedingungen bedenkt
1572857 unser ziel ist ein umsatz von einer milliarde euro bis zum jahr 2010
1572858 ich habe f nf jahre in dieser chemischen wolke zugebracht nun wei ich dass das nicht wieder passieren wird
1572859 wenn ich vor zehn jahren gestorben w re dann w re ich heute vermutlich eine kultfigur
1572860 1960 als pop art in new york auftauchte fuhr die kunstszene so darauf ab dass sogar die steifen europ ischen typen zugeben mussten dass wir teil der weltkultur waren
1572861 alles was ich tue hat mit dem tod zu tun
1572862 wie jeder k nstler wie eigentlich jeder mensch will andy geliebt werden
1572863 halston hatte andys haus in montauk gemietet wir fuhren mit der limousine zum privatjet und vom flughafen mit der limousine weiter
1572864 viele menschen glauben dass er mit gott einen pakt gemacht hat als er auf dem operationstisch lag
1572865 andy hat immer das positive gesehen und betont er war nie gemein
1572866 ich hoffe sie sagt mir vorher bescheid damit ich sie dabei filmen kann
1572867 wait a minute whats taking you so long to get down didnt you leave yesterday
1572868 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
1572869 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1572870 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1572871 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
1572872 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
1572873 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
1572874 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
1572875 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
1572876 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
1572877 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
1572878 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
1572879 young gore sets out for his new home where the sky is clear the water is clean and there are no republicans
1572880 former vice president al gore who for the past three decades has unsuccessfully attempted to warn humanity of the coming destruction of our planet only to be mocked and derided by the very people he has tried to save launched his infant son into space monday in the faint hope that his only child would reach the safety of another world
1572881 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1572882 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
1572883 this is no fantasy no careless product of wild imagination no my friends these indictments that i have brought to you today specific charges herein against the individuals their acts of treason their ultimate aim of sedition these are matters of undeniable fact i ask you now to pronounce judgment on those accused
1572884 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
1572885 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
1572886 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
1572887 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
1572888 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
1572889 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
1572890 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
1572891 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
1572892 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
1572893 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
1572894 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
1572895 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
1572896 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
1572897 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
1572898 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
1572899 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
1572900 as a great admirer of the royal family i was disgusted to see that two of the animals in
1572901 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1572902 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1572903 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
1572904 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
1572905 benefiting from early detection through a doctor ordered mri the cancer is not life threatening
1572906 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery no further statement will be issued at this time
1572907 the extension of the conservatorship was at the request and suggestion of britneys doctors theyve indicated shes made great improvement but its a work in progress jamie spears doesnt want the conservatorship to last a day longer than the doctors recommend
1572908 as it stands now john will be on the red carpet with her and dont be at all surprised to see jennifer sporting an engagement ring by then these two are serious
1572909 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
1572910 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
1572911 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
1572912 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
1572913 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
1572914 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
1572915 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
1572916 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
1572917 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
1572918 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
1572919 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
1572920 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
1572921 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1572922 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1572923 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1572924 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1572925 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1572926 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1572927 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1572928 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1572929 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1572930 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1572931 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1572932 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1572933 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1572934 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1572935 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1572936 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1572937 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1572938 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1572939 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1572940 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1572941 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1572942 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people what was good about this was that we got everybody involved
1572943 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1572944 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
1572945 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
1572946 it was mary kate olsen you sonofabitch ill have your badge for breakfast
1572947 placer le sport au service du d veloppement harmonieux de lhomme en vue de promouvoir une soci t de paix concern e par le respect de la dignit humaine
1572948 place sport at the service of the harmonious development of man with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity
1572949 place sport at the service of the harmonious development of man with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity
1572950 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1572951 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1572952 we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death
1572953 and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1572954 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1572955 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1572956 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public dina is still working on the date of the party but its looking like towards the end of the year
1572957 he has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but he is in good spirits
1572958 he is going to have surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to correct the damage he says hell be okay and is looking forward to a full recovery
1572959 it was mary kate olsen you sonofabitch ill have your badge for breakfast
1572960 two defeats is not the way i envisaged coming back with england i didnt wait 18 months to get beaten
1572961 it wasnt ideal but in a perverse way the first one at headingley i enjoyed in the sense of being back around the lads playing in front of a big crowd and playing for england
1572962 i just wish the outcome had been slightly different because for six months ive had to work so hard to get back in the side i am enjoying being there
1572963 ive had a start ive bowled some overs and ive batted okay but now i need to start performing properly
1572964 before this ankle operation i thought if i didnt think i could recapture the form of previously i wouldnt have put myself up for all of this
1572965 i feel i can do that i feel i am getting there but i can rattle on as much as i can about it ive got to start doing it out on the field
1572966 people go on about the ashes next year weve got thursday to concentrate on weve got beaten twice by south africa and weve got to pull it around a bit
1572967 it is not a dead rubber maybe it is in the context of the series but we are playing for england and we are certainly playing for pride it is not measured by a trophy or a cheque there is a lot for us to play for as cricketers
1572968 for a start weve got to score more runs in the first innings of a test match than we have in the last two to give ourselves a decent chance
1572969 now that the olympic games are finally upon us its a chance to show how tibetans feel and what their hopes are
1572970 outsiders may think that the tibetans are treated very well and that they are happy but the truth is that tibetans are not free to speak of their suffering
1572971 even if i had to sacrifice my life for this message to be seen by the dalai lama i agree and welcome this chance
1572972 i have complete faith in what captain anil kumble can do
1572973 there is a calm focus about the team and there is a humility about how we are going to go about our business there is no arrogance in the environment
1572974 these players are aware what they need to do and they are right on track in terms of preparations the important thing is the awareness of the situation they know they have an opportunity to win the series
1572975 every guy is aware if he is not fully focused for the next test it could affect the teams performance
1572976 we were happy with the teams response as they lifted their performance by at least 20 percent in galle
1572977 but the important thing is there is a real awareness about things to achieve in the next test and we have always believed that when this team is firing on all cylinders they can match the best in the world
1572978 there was a tremendous hurt in the team after the loss i think it all started with kumble and from there it filtered down to the rest of the team he is a fantastic leader and fighter
1572979 so to motivate the team to improve their performance by 20 percent was not really difficult the big challenge now is to see that they maintain it in the third test since they have pulled one back
1572980 he is quality seamer and at the moment he stands out in the indian line up i am very impressed by what he has to offer
1572981 he is learning which are good areas to bowl so at the end of the day we tell him to bowl the natural length and when he is bowling his natural length he is as good as anyone in the world
1572982 the success of any test playing side is how each batsman sticks to his own skill
1572983 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
1572984 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
1572985 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1572986 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
1572987 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
1572988 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
1572989 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
1572990 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
1572991 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
1572992 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
1572993 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
1572994 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
1572995 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1572996 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
1572997 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
1572998 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1572999 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1573000 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1573001 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1573002 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
1573003 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
1573004 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
1573005 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
1573006 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
1573007 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
1573008 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
1573009 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
1573010 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
1573011 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
1573012 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
1573013 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1573014 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1573015 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
1573016 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
1573017 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
1573018 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
1573019 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
1573020 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis

1573027 people are in different social environments and are influenced by various factors and eating habits so its hard to answer the question of why people live long
1573028 but we can say that the improvement of medical technologies helps
1573029 we should restore our position in cuba and other countries
1573030 well lets face it we all have something dangling between our legs
1573031 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well
1573032 they used to be teased every time they used the boys toilets
1573033 so they started using the girls toilets instead but that made the girls feel uncomfortable it made these boys unhappy and started to affect their work
1573034 so we dont want to use the boys toilet we want them to know we are transsexuals
1573035 people need to know that being a transsexual is not a joke
1573036 its the way we want to live our lives thats why were grateful for what the school has done
1573037 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
1573038 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
1573039 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
1573040 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
1573041 vast hordes who descend on us annually causing bedlam and chaos to locals
1573042 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1573043 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1573044 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1573045 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1573046 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
1573047 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
1573048 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
1573049 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
1573050 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
1573051 if the vice president says its do able i believe
1573052 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
1573053 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
1573054 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
1573055 i think some people would contend that because we have continued to make a sizable investment there hasnt been a proper incentive until now for the iraqi government to make its own investment
1573056 nosotros los costarricenses estamos muy agradecidos con todo lo que han hecho por nuestra salud en lo que respeta a los ojos muchas gracias a los m dicos y a las personas que han colaborado para que este programa se haga realidad desde el momento que llegamos ac a venezuela no nos han dejado ni un instante solos

1573058 no me queda m s que agradecerle a la naci n venezolana por todo el apoyo que nos dan a nosotros y a todos los hermanos latinoamericanos sin fijarse en religi n ni clase
1573059 deep deep inside like those women who morn for the dead
1573060 move out of your comfort zone you can only grow if you are willing to feel awkward and uncomfortable when you try something new
1573061 i think stories like this remind us that our actions arent just moments in time they go on without us
1573062 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1573063 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1573064 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1573065 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1573066 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
1573067 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
1573068 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
1573069 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1573070 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
1573071 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
1573072 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
1573073 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
1573074 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
1573075 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
1573076 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
1573077 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
1573078 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1573079 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1573080 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1573081 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
1573082 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1573083 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1573084 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1573085 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1573086 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
1573087 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1573088 its a lot of core work holding a pose for a minute or two
1573089 some weird stuff its hard muscles you didnt even know you had start burning but it makes you more flexible and functional when i get done i feel great
1573090 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1573091 consideramos que eso sin duda afecta esas celebraciones pero fundamentalmente afecta a sucre que se merec a una celebraci n y una sesi n de honor del congreso nacional
1573092 lamentablemente sus autoridades de sucre no han contribuido a ello han promovido actos de violencia y han puesto en riesgo la integridad f sica de los congresistas y del cuerpo diplom tico
1573093 reinvindicaci n para todas aquellas personas que se dedican al trabajo social

1573096 fue todo un ataque sostenido a la toma de medidas para conjurar la crisis
1573097 steve ratner sic has paid my wife 500 000 00 to leave me
1573098 most everything mr cosgrove claims is either untrue or a gross exaggeration
1573099 this ought to be a story that while painful remained private
1573100 he should have thought about that before he did what he did to me
1573101 helpless against the destruction that can be wrought by aggressive campaigns on the internet
1573102 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
1573103 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
1573104 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1573105 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
1573106 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
1573107 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1573108 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
1573109 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
1573110 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
1573111 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1573112 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
1573113 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1573114 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1573115 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1573116 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1573117 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1573118 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1573119 a man may deal with theory and miss the whole impact of the truth
1573120 if the hiss doesnt tell you its a snake then the fact that it slithers on its belly in the dirt should
1573121 there were a lot of really good performances from our young guys that have us excited
1573122 pierre we thought might be a little ways away because of his competition level but hes done everything in camp you could ask and he continued that sunday pierre looked like he fit right in with that group
1573123 if you notice every run i had the line did a great job
1573124 there was always a hole for me to get through
1573125 every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around
1573126 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1573127 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1573128 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
1573129 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
1573130 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
1573131 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
1573132 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
1573133 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
1573134 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
1573135 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
1573136 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
1573137 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
1573138 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
1573139 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
1573140 authors of confessions write especially to avoid confession to tell nothing of what they know
1573141 i practice the profession of penitence to be able to end up as a judge

1573152 this bill makes an important step in the direction of humane treatment for young people in desperate circumstances but we need to continue to work to solve the problems that lead teens to run away in the first place
1573153 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
1573154 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
1573155 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
1573156 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete

1573169 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
1573170 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
1573171 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
1573172 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
1573173 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
1573174 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
1573175 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature

1573232 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects
1573233 however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1573234 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive

1573258 did you hear about the new state program to measure effectiveness of dentists with their young patients
1573259 they will just count the number of cavities each patient has at age 10 14 and 18 and average that to determine a dentists rating dentists will be rated as excellent good average below average and unsatisfactory that way parents will know which are the best dentists it will also encourage the less effective dentists to get better
1573260 poor dentists who dont improve could lose their licenses to practice
1573261 dont you think we should try to improve childrens dental health in this state
1573262 but thats not a fair way to determine who is practicing good dentistry
1573263 dont you see that dentists dont all work with the same clientele so much depends on things we cant control for example
1573264 i work in a rural area with a high percentage of patients from deprived homes while some of my colleagues work in upper middle class neighborhoods many of the parents i work with dont bring their children to see me until there am some kind of problem and i dont get to do much preventive work also
1573265 many of the parents i serve let their kids eat way too much candy from an early age unlike more educated parents who understand the relationship between sugar and decay to top it all off
1573266 so many of my clients have well water which is untreated and has no fluoride in it do you have any idea how much difference early use of fluoride can make
1573267 my best patients are as good as anyones my work is as good as anyones but my average cavity count is going to be higher than a lot of other dentists because i chose to work where i am needed most
1573268 try furious in a system like this i will end up being rated average below average or worse my more educated patients who see these ratings may believe this so called rating actually is a measure of my ability and proficiency as a dentist they may leave me and ill be left with only the most needy patients and my cavity average score will get even worse on top of that how will i attract good dental hygienists and other excellent dentists to my practice if it is labeled below average
1573269 complaining excuse making and stonewalling wont improve dental health i am quoting from a leading member of the doc
1573270 a group made up of mostly laypersons to make sure dentistry in this state gets improved
1573271 cavities are the bottom line and you cant argue with the bottom line its an absolute measure
1573272 thats what im afraid the parents of my current patients and prospective patients will think this cant be happening
1573273 if youre rated poorly theyll send a dentist who is rated excellent to help straighten you out
1573274 theyll send a dentist with a wealthy clientele to show me how to work on severe juvenile dental problems with which i have probably had much more experience big help
1573275 doing this would be like grading schools and teachers on an average score on a test of childrens progress without regard to influences outside the school the home the community served and stuff like that why would they do something so unfair to dentists no one would ever think of doing that to schools
1573276 ill use the school analogy surely they will see the point

1573300 you could talk to shawn and hed tell you the same thing
1573301 andy has been nothing but sensitive to shawns situation he didnt disclose this personal issue even though he has been peppered with questions about it
1573302 andy didnt find out shawn wasnt mentally prepared to go to camp until 24 hours before
1573303 i talked to andy right after that and he told me it was in shawns best interest for me to fly to little rock and assess the situation andy thought it would be best if we made shawn a doctors appointment
1573304 once we got the appointment it took a few days to find out the diagnosis that finally happened last thursday and it took a few days for shawn to feel comfortable about it
1573305 why would you not send the letter if you dont know what the problem is they didnt know until they finally got the diagnosis it was andy who suggested to me that i go meet with shawn and andy has communicated with shawn and directly with the doctor weve been working together to do whats best for shawn and whats best for the eagles
1573306 now that coach reid understands that i have stepped forward and i do have a problem and im trying to get it rectified i think hes more sensitive to whats going on
1573307 i admitted that some of the rumors that have been out there actually were started by myself initially he didnt know what to think because im telling him one thing and hes hearing all these other rumors coach reid he does have a heart and i respect coach reid and the organization
1573308 im still under a doctors care i have another appointment thursday and i cant go in there faking im ready to go back the problem isnt going to go away if i fake it im going to see my doctor and my medication is slowly taking effect so i hope to be back and i want to be back well see how it plays out

1573323 mr costello has made not one valuable structure change in the australian economy in the 12 years he was treasurer
1573324 hes a guy without imagination and he is a guy without courage
1573325 that point was proven by the fact he let former prime minister john howard stay there for so long
1573326 its a liberal party so bereft of talent that they have go to such a low grade performer as costello to come back as their leader he is a slow acting dope
1573327 in national terms to have such a nong and he is in policy terms he is a mouse to have him back again speaks volumes about the liberal party

1573331 what ive discovered in my research is and the department of veterans affairs has now acknowledged it there is a correlation between trauma suffered by vets and subsequent behavioural issues from their kids he said
1573332 they see their parents flipping out and losing it they see breakdown in marriages they somehow take an assumed guilt position and start to feel vulnerable about the whole issue
1573333 i believe this has impacted on this young lady and i think its probably indicative of what may happen to other veterans kids too

1573368 if you are a chronic pain patient you have pain 24 hours a day seven days a week every minute of your life
1573369 that permanent perception of pain in your brain makes these areas in your brain continuously active this continuous dysfunction in the equilibrium of the brain can change the wiring forever and could hurt the brain
1573370 it could be that pain produces depression and the other reported abnormalities because it disturbs the balance of the brain as a whole

1573384 honesty is a complex and subtle subject not so much an end in itself as a means of being responsible and respectful to the needs of others and of oneself
1573385 honesty is a principal ingredient in any establishment of trust one person cant trust another deeply without believing that the interaction between them will be carried on at a high level of honesty trustful relations can bear the occasional white lie to be sensitive to the feelings of others but not habitual dishonesty beyond the damage it does in specific situations the reason we all are anxious about dishonesty is that it erodes trust what misrepresentation of the truth will the person who is known to have been dishonest next put forth when for what motive
1573386 the great leap in trust possible in adolescence or later adulthood is for an individual to become trustworthy individually even when it is not reciprocated
1573387 i believe males get to this highest level of trustworthiness only when they are inspired to it by encountering someone who embodies it it is a level of character that is much more effectively caught than taught

1573462 thats why we keep mentioning the need for the city to own its own police community facilities i think the community deserves to have its own police facilities and not dependent who has it there for profit and not for the good of the community
1573463 as i see it its a very viable program its one that i think works
1573464 its not a one year program were hoping we can lock in a lot of the social services programs and a lot of the other partners get them to step up also to deal with the root cause of problems in that area
1573465 i really would have to look down and see what the regions doing now that the new budget is coming up for many other cities to see what the pay rate is now for regional police departments
1573466 adding 240 units that are filled with renters and not homeowners is going to severely impact our quality of life
1573467 our homes cant possibly be as quiet our home values are going to most likely go down our safety and security cannot be promised and these people are renting theyre not as invested in the community as we are and theyre probably going to outnumber us in this small area
1573468 its like an oasis in the midst of all the traffic all the roads
1573469 affects every day of the rest of our lives and the quality of every moment of every one of those days
1573470 its difficult to comprehend that our city doesnt care and that they dont care about our family environment and our neighborhoods within the city limits
1573471 even though i do have some ambivalence i might just support it
1573472 this site whatever goes here will not contribute to urban sprawl and will not contribute to more and more environmental hazards from cars as if it was out five or 10 miles in the county
1573473 i dont always vote at the ballot but i move with my feet and my dollars every day
1573474 o consumo do luxo dividido em dois grupos os que t m dinheiro e os que querem ter
1573475 no caso do brasil pesa muito o fato de que quem tem dinheiro compra impulsivamente e os que n o t m tanto sobrando fazem de tudo para ter o objeto de seus sonhos
1573476 abrimos uma exce o mundial e parcelamos o pagamento de nossas j ias porque sabemos do sonho brasileiro pelo glamour e queremos tornar o encanto acess vel

1573484 while we have been focusing on baghdad and kabul our own cities have been changing right in front of us atlanta for example is shifting from an overwhelmingly black to what is likely to soon be a minority black city this is happening in part because the white middle class is moving inside the city borders but more so because blacks are moving out between 1990 and 2006 according to research by william frey of the brookings institution the white population of atlanta has increased from roughly 30 percent to 35 percent while the black population has declined from 67 percent to 55 percent in this decade alone two of atlantas huge suburban counties clayton and dekalb have acquired substantial black majorities and immigrants arriving from foreign countries are settling primarily there or in similar outlying areas not within the city itself the numbers for washington d c are similar
1573485 what are you complaining about youve already exceeded your life expectancy

1573488 each carries certain assumptions about the nature of reality individuals and society as well as a particular vision for the common good these fundamental beliefs transcend the political sphere and the astute christian observer should thus discern the subtle ways in which ideologies are rooted in idolatrous worldviews
1573489 david koyzis has produced a truly original book illuminating the landscape of modern political ideologies his approach is distinctively christian giving him a standpoint from which to cririque liberal as well as totalitarian ideologies moreover the book is up to date with the post cold war world this is the place to start for anyone who wants to understand the dynamics of ideological conflict in the world today

1573506 awareness of world heritage status at local level has been a challenge in ujung kulon national park this is due to the fact that local people and often even local government lack knowledge and understanding of world heritage status in addition to this they did not perceive direct benefit of obtaining the status
1573507 with the help of the world heritage centre and rare we hope to build a stronger conservation constituency in support of the park and its efforts to promote conservation in addition this will help to protect against the threats of unsustainable resource use population expansion uncontrolled tourism and other forms of unregulated development
1573508 as ujung kulon national park manager in any meeting or workshop i use the parks world heritage status to draw the attention of all of the parks stakeholders to protect the site more genuinely local and central government have supported every policy that came from uknp management authority to help the protection and conservation in uknp because they know the importance of uknp as a world heritage site
1573509 the wwf and the uknp managers in any meeting or proposal use world heritage status to increase the enthusiasm of donors to help fund their projects in uknp there is also a high level of willingness to give financial support to conservation programs in uknp amongst many park stakeholders they have awareness and pride in the value of the parks natural resources and its importance as a world heritage site
1573510 increased networking and exchange between sites can improve management further especially between protected areas outside the country
1573511 through this important planning tool we hope to build the capacity within the park staff to plan for and manage existing tourism we will also explore the potential of using sustainable tourism as a tool in the future to achieve greater biodiversity conservation in the park and to protect against the possibility of unplanned tourism development extending down the coastline
1573512 the inscription of the site as a natural wh increases the value of the park itself to the visitor people are more interested to visit the site knowing the important value that has been recognized through nomination and listing as a natural wh site they appreciate it

1573521 receiver steve smith was suspended two games by the carolina panthers after his training camp fight with cornerback ken lucas
1573522 smith a three time pro bowl selection will continue to practice when training camp resumes monday and will be allowed to participate in preseason games coach john fox said saturday
1573523 lucas who left the practice field at wofford college on friday with ice over his left eye has a broken nose fox said smith was kicked out of practice and sent back to charlotte
1573524 the suspension will cost smith more than 205 000 a fraction of his base salary fox also seemed to issue a stern warning toward smith and his future actions

1573528 ayah mengapa wajah ayah kian berkerut merut dengan badan ayah yang kian hari kian terbungkuk
1573529 ibu mengapa wajah ayah menjadi berkerut merut dan badannya kian hari kian terbungkuk dan sepertinya ayah menjadi demikian tanpa ada keluhan dan rasa sakit
1573530 anakku jika seorang laki laki yang benar bertanggung jawab terhadap keluarga itu memang akan demikian
1573531 saat ku ciptakan laki laki aku membuatnya sebagai pemimpin keluarga serta sebagai tiang penyangga dari bangunan keluarga dia senantiasa akan menahan setiap ujungnya agar keluarganya merasa aman teduh dan terlindungi
1573532 kuciptakan bahunya yang kekar dan berotot untuk membanting tulang menghidupi seluruh keluarganya dan kegagahannya harus cukup kuat pula untuk melindungi seluruh keuarganya
1573533 kuberikan kemauan padanya agar berusaha mencari sesuap nasi yang berasal dari tetesan keringatnya sendiri yang halal dan yang bersih agar keluarganya tidak terlantar walaupun seringkali dia mendapatkan cercaan dari anak anaknya
1573534 kuberikan keperkasaan dan mental baja yang akan membuat dirinya pantang menyerah demi keluarganya dia merelakan kulitnya tersengat panasnya matahari demi keluarganya dia merelakan badannya basah kuyup kedinginan karena tersiram hujan dan hembusan angin dia relakan tenaga perkasanya terkuras demi keluarganya dan yang selalu dia ingat adalah disaat semua orang menanti kedatangannya dengan mengharapkan hasil dari jerih payahnya
1573535 kuberikan kesabaran ketekunan serta keuletan yang akan membuat dirinya selalu berusaha merawat dan membimbing keluarganya tanpa adanya keluh kesah walaupun disetiap perjalanan hidupnya keletihan dan kesakitan kerap kali menyerangnya
1573536 kuberikan perasaan keras dan gigih untuk berusaha berjuang demi mencintai dan mengasihi keluarganya di dalam kondisi dan situasi apapun juga walaupun tidaklah jarang anak anaknya melukai perasaan hatinya padahal perasaan itulah yang telah memberikan perlindungan rasa aman pada saat dimana anak anaknya tertidur lelap serta sentuhan perasaannya itulah yang memberikan kenyamanan bila saat dia sedang menepuk nepuk bahu anak anaknya agar selalu saling menyayangi dan mengasihi sesama saudara
1573537 kuberikan kebijaksanaan dan kemampuan padanya untuk memberikan pengetahuan dan menyadarkan bahwa istri yang baik adalah istri yang setia terhadap suaminya istri yang baik adalah istri yang senantiasa menemani dan bersama sama menghadapi perjalanan hidup baik suka maupun duka walaupun seringkali kebijaksanaannya itu akan menguji setiap kesetian yang diberikan kepadanya agar berdiri bertahan sejajar dan saling melengkapi serta saling menyayangi
1573538 kuberikan kerutan diwajahnya agar menjadi bukti bahwa laki laki itu senantiasa berusaha sekuat daya pikirnya untuk mencari dan menemukan cara agar keluarganya bisa hidup di dalam keluarga bahagia dan badannya yang terbungkuk agar dapat membuktikan bahwa sebagai laki laki yang bertanggung jawab terhadap seluruh keluarganya senantiasa berusaha mencurahkan sekuat tenaga serta segenap perasaannya kekuatannya keuletannya demi kelangsungan hidup keluarganya
1573539 kuberikan kepada laki laki tanggung jawab penuh sebagai pemimpin keluarga sebagai tiang penyangga agar dapat dipergunakan dengan sebaik baiknya dan hanya inilah kelebihan yang dimilki oleh laki laki walaupun sebenarnya tanggung jawab ini adalah amanah di dunia dan akhirat

1573542 deporting christians for worshiping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation

1573571 theres so much money to be made right now in mixed martial arts and its all about the fighters trying to make that money its going to be a long term deal where i put my heart and soul into the company and help build them thats something im interested in doing theyre going to bring me on not just as a fighter but also doing some of the back work also
1573572 the ufc have the right to match the offer so ill be getting a deal that no other fighter has ever gotten its going to be some ground breaking news for sure
1573573 im going to a company thats going to take care of me a company thats going to respect me a company thats going to put me in the forefront and make me the ambassador that ive always been i think mr trump respects me at that value to get it my hearts not with the ufc anymore because of how bad they treated me they dont respect me and they dont see me as a businessman all they think is that im a punk fighter thats going to fold and ive already proven that im not going to fold to anything by not resigning with them
1573574 hes already been talking smack saying if he sees me hes going to kick my ass but right on if he keeps thinking that hell get his face caved in sooner or later i know frank shamrock is another person whos been opening up his mouth he beat me the last time we fought and i think that would be a great revenge fight where i kick his ass and finally shut him up as time goes well see who affliction signs besides me i dont know i might even go up to heavyweight if the bigger pay days are there
1573575 the parliamentary liberal party has elected colin barnett as its leader
1573576 the election was for one nomination only and was unopposed
1573577 the vote was unanimous for colin to lead us into the next election and to provide the people of western australia with the opportunity of a government that is far better than this current labor government
1573578 oh it doesnt matter who you vote for it wont change anything

1573582 all expenses are covered by the national park but sometimes we get extra funds from turtle release donors for hatchery safeguarding costs
1573583 turtles landing habitat is also monitored in this conservative system of conservation
1573584 various propositions have been put forward this year ranging from a second pipeline from the north of the state to the south to building massive gas storage facilities near perth
1573585 the cost and viability of many of these ideas has been called into question by industry
1573586 but we need to consider all options and that is exactly what i have asked the office of energy to do
1573587 we have constant conversations with all our customers and try to meet their needs as best we can
1573588 the accc has found australias independent supermarkets fail to take up the fight to their competitors by lowering prices
1573589 it is these supermarkets that under the states current trading laws are allowed to trade on sundays and weeknights while their competitors cant
1573590 as a result it is western australian consumers who are being punished by paying more than they should for food and groceries
1573591 its a claim supported by recent data released by the australia bureau of statistics showing that western australian shoppers pay the most for food and groceries than those in other states
1573592 a one size fits all approach will kill the gold industry
1573593 dont make that mistake thats my message to the government
1573594 the gold industry is still under threat its been in decline for 10 years
1573595 its inappropriate to panic people but im concerned that this ets might put operations under threat
1573596 adding another us40 to us50 per ounce to costs would make it very hard
1573597 it may mean the difference between tropicana getting up or not getting up
1573598 she is also a mother she should know what burdens we already bear for our families but rather than helping her policies instead impose additional burdens on us
1573599 if the president truly cared for women and mothers like she said in her speech she should at least help us feed our families the 500 pesos subsidy of her government has never reached us
1573600 what her government has brought to us is increased vulnerabilities to violence
1573601 poverty and militarization are what we get from her so called development programs
1573602 arroyo should visit our communities so to see what our real situation is her sona is only for malacanang it does not reflect the realities we lumad women face
1573603 our official position is that the agreement on ancestral domain has been signed so its a done deal
1573604 its an internal process in the government what was committed by the government cannot be taken back
1573605 the act of initialing the agreed text of moa ad by the parties constitutes a signature of the philippine government and milf initialing was in fact done with a credible third party witness the malaysian government as facilitator of the talks since 2001
1573606 we are on the upper hand especially in the battle for moral ascendancy
1573607 still pursue the peace process to bring an end to the conflict without however losing sight of alternative means to achieve freedom and justice
1573608 its simply that we have to observe the democratic process of doing things involving three coequal branches of government
1573609 nobody is giving up on peace we have not given up on peace we will never give up on peace
1573610 we came here to sign the moa and not to meet not to argue its as simple as that
1573611 what should simmer in our minds is for peace and tranquility to exist there ought not to be violence in any instance
1573612 we stand by that that is why we are confident our supreme court will find this to be resolved
1573613 we allowed our myopia our recklessness our xenophobia to take the better of us
1573614 these lgus are provoking the peoples anger by saying that the deal was done in haste they were participants to many of these consultations why arent they telling the people that there were consultations done
1573615 its fortunate that the supreme court has already stepped in because they can very well determine the legal boundaries and legality of this agreement whether we are now giving up our territory in exchange for a peace agreement
1573616 giving our muslim brothers the right to govern themselves and the right to utilize and exploit their wealth is perfectly legitimate but i would not allow the emerging entity to be able to conduct diplomacy and foreign relations to be able to issue their own currency and to allow them to carry arms and raise troops
1573617 those are the three earmarks of an independent state and it would be incongruous that within our territorial boundaries another state will be created theres no country in the world who can still maintain its self respect and dignity by allowing that might as well agree to separate
1573618 its not a state within a state that is being recognized here rather its the muslim nation its the people who will decide thats why there is a plebiscite and before that there must be an enabling law passed by congress so before there is an enabling law there is nothing
1573619 terrorism in mindanao is state initiated therefore it follows that poverty in mindanao is also caused by the arroyo government
1573620 the state declared war on terror supposedly aimed to maintain peace in mindanao turned out to be a war of terror intended to protect the us and arroyos financial and political interests she deployed members of the military even in conflict free areas to silence the people who oppose her so called development projects
1573621 it is the government which quashes any hope of peace in mindanao arroyos on and off peace talks and anti terror policy are being used to bail her out of a sagging popularity due to her failure to resolve economic and political crises in the country
1573622 makasih buat semua awak n a makasih juga buat espe tiganya hahahahaha
1573623 cats have facial glands that they use to mark their territory
1573624 cats pheromones help improve their geographic orientation which is what they perceive as their own space or their boundaries
1573625 its a way for them to claim that particular area as their own and they get pleasure out of rubbing their face against something
1573626 a cat that feels stressed in the environment will either hide vertically mark with their paws or spray urine
1573627 synthetic facial pheromones help them feel comfortable so they wont urine mark or vertically scratch behaviors owners dont like
1573628 i knew id like it here but i didnt know id like it this much
1573629 a lot of these guys are going to be around for a while and ill be one of them i just couldnt be happier
1573630 i didnt realize what an intense competitor he is and what a big game pitcher he is
1573631 the better the opponent the tougher the game the more excited he is about pitching
1573632 i literally just left a meeting where we were talking about that
1573633 the energy tonight was more powerful here than anywhere ive ever been the fans were amazing
1573634 obviously b j is pulling for gsp because he wants to fight him
1573635 we know that b j wants to fight gsp again especially if gsp wins but no we dont know
1573636 he had a physical condition exhaustion dehydration that caused delirium
1573637 slum areas are frequently flooded because there is no proper garbage collection
1573638 sewers are usually clogged and the residents are forced to wade in flood waters
1573639 when the poor get sick they cannot afford to go to the doctor for check up
1573640 i saw that i had a problem right away now all of a sudden i have no bonding
1573641 having spent the last two years reading contracts it was very beneficial
1573642 i was able to ask some very specific questions on issues that i had developed over the two years that i have been doing this
1573643 when you have a free session with an attorney thats very good
1573644 one of the best things about it was that we all networked with one another
1573645 hopefully we can patronize each other besides finding other business out there
1573646 there are a lot of companies out there that really want to help minority and women owned businesses and not just because they have quotas to meet a lot of them are very sincere
1573647 a dream that came true to see something on paper translate to real life the vision translate to reality is absolutely incredible
1573648 take this pilot process and move it into a sustainable model that could possibly go statewide
1573649 i drive about 35 miles round trip to work every day so this recycle made a good deal on my gas tank
1573650 i put over half of it in my gas tank and thatll last me two weeks worth of going to work and back
1573651 we have real collectors with 200 pounds and the little grandmother bringing them down in the back of her cadillac five pounds at a time
1573652 people of a certain economic status are willing to turn anything over for cash
1573653 theyre going to pick up the old radiator theyre going to pick up the old swing and bring it to recycle
1573654 since this has all come about within the last 24 hours it is something that our office will be reviewing
1573655 because boscovs filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy which will restructure their company and assets the bankruptcy court has the power to override
1573656 i happened to watch the sona but it was not worth hearing at all because i didnt believe in what she was saying the poor are still hungry lining up for rice everyday for a limited kilo the expanded vat is still there her speech had no soul sad to say sona must provide direction on major concerns which depicts the state of the nation of the past year not to report on what has been perceived as accomplishments of the government which she does not need to tell us because we know already no clapping is needed
1573657 nothing really new but rehashed statistics that does not translate into food on the table of mang pandoy
1573658 the arroyo administration has just thrown out the window its austerity program
1573659 if vat was to be removed lowering fuel prices by four to six pesos give oil companies a few weeks and they will find excuses to increase fuel prices again and again and again until the decrease due to the removal of vat will eventually be lost so there is still no effect
1573660 the president spoke of what is happening i was surprised about mindanao being the fruit rather food basket of the nation yet a lot of population here are hungry
1573661 i did not hear her sona up to the end but i think that the good programs will not be effective if corruption issues are not handled if businesses are not happy we wont get the foreign investment
1573662 im happy that the president is focusing on programs that will alleviate poverty and help our countrymen survive the global economic crisis
1573663 if gma says that vat stabilized the economy the people did not feel that
1573664 for the workers under the kilusang mayo uno what gma is saying that the economy has progressed is not true wage only increased by 10 20 peso and most of it is the cost of living allowance progress is not felt by the people if you look at whats happening the cost of fare is very high lines are very long in nfa outlets what she said are mere pogi points the economy is in crisis survey shows that hunger is prevalent workers are deprived of the 125 across the board wage increase where can you see the progress in the economy there is no logic with that many people are starving
1573665 what more can we expect from pgmas 8th sona its just another round of state rhetoric empty promises and lack of political will to address the real state of the filipino children since pgma assumed power the gap between childrens vulnerability and the fulfilment of their rights continue to widen to some extent theres growing despair among children who are deprived of their basic rights to survival development protection and participation poverty and hunger incidence is at its peak especially here in mindanao which registers a poverty incidence of 40 percent peasant children lumad moro christian are also being displaced because of intensified militarization in the countryside if she really meant social programs for the poor in her sona what we want is a comprehensive approach and not palliative measures filipino children demands food not bombs education not bullets free and accessible health services and not militarization basic social services for the disadvantaged and not exhorbitant taxes
1573666 vat is the reason why the people wallow in poverty vat should be removed especially the vat in gasoline because it directly affects the poor big oil players are not affected by this there is no progress as what she claims
1573667 the subsidies she gave are only propaganda to cover up her crimes against the people
1573668 gmas speech is same old story i dont feel any progress there is no change in the clamor for wage increase the prices of basic goods and fare are very high oil prices are being manipulated because if shell and petron are loosing in their business why is it that plenty of small players in the oil industry are emerging
1573669 why is she prioritizing building infrastructures she should feed the people she only wants to boast to foreigners that the society is progressing but deep inside many people are hungry
1573670 she says that she gave plenty of scholarships and yet public schools are not for free
1573671 have you ever wondered why some areas in bulacan and other parts of the philippines are like venice becoming permanently submerged in water
1573672 the supreme court is right because after all not everybody knows the content memorandum of agreement he said
1573673 i admire the sc for being really independent and the agreement must be made public too
1573674 they should be also informed because it will affect them in other words transparency and public participation is really needed
1573675 thats tro good because there will be opportunity for us to see and scrutinize the content of the agreement which is of course of national interest and concern
1573676 the government should explain every detail of the agreement because it is something that concerns the filipino people especially with this long standing problem of relationship with the muslims
1573677 we owe it to the filipino people to explain the agreements details
1573678 politicians should be more considerate this time for peace in the whole philippines and especially in mindanao
1573679 it could be properly discussed and probably a compromise could be made to prevent any trouble in the future
1573680 but penury hunger and inhuman living all that this government can give to the filipino people
1573681 in our church in payatas a child lined for the holy communion but the problem is he was not older than seven years old the child cried when i told him he was not allowed to take the holy host because he has not taken yet his first communion he cried and cried begging me saying father sige na po gutum na gutom na po ako gusto ko po ng tinapay
1573682 last monday july 21 there was a huge fire in pandacan some of the victims were aglipayans two children died unable to escape the fiery blaze while the mother was in a long line waiting for her turn to buy some kilos of nfa national food authority rice not so long ago there were siblings that have died also in the fire here in payatas while their parents were working scavenging in the huge piles of garbage
1573683 a small bread can bring a lot of joy to that small boy how many breads bags of rice and other food items can be bought and distributed to millions of our poor kababayans by billions of pesos that were stolen and planned to be stolen by this government
1573684 there is no moral basis for anyone to remain in power especially those in the highest position if their positions are being used to make themselves rich while the people are impoverishing and dying because of hunger
1573685 as a church that promotes life it is righteous for the church to join the people in condemning in the strongest terms the plundering of peoples money and the abuse of power of those who is in authority
1573686 gloria is riding over the pro life position of the church it is rightful that the church be in front in condemning the policies and programs of a corrupt president whos number one in destroying and in depriving life and dignity to the millions of filipinos
1573687 we will not close our eyes on the immorality of this government we are with you in fighting and in making the arroyo government accountable who untiringly looting the countrys chest and economy and continuously suppressing and massacring the people on that note hand in hand lets call for her resignation
1573688 the continuing culture of corruption from the top to the bottom of our social and political ladder
1573689 president and all the branches of government to take the lead in combating corruption wherever it is found
1573690 all the actuaries all the objective scorekeepers of the federal government are predicting this
1573691 if you have a different motive like constitutional change no matter what is written there is okay you only need to put the provision there that anything will be effective upon changing the constitution
1573692 i told some people in government that you know very well that none of this is deliverable without the act of congress and without charter change and you barely have a year and a half so why go for a piece of paper that will not be delivered what is your motive for signing it why not leave it to the next administration or president is their real intention is to change the constitution at all cost or for any price at the expense of the whole peace process in mindanao
1573693 what is the real purpose here i really believe its charter change that is so obvious on a personal note im outrage that they would use something such as the peace process as a way to stay in power that is the height of lack of integrity of this administration
1573694 some filipino muslims are actually angry that im speaking out against the agreement my position is i believe it wont truly benefit us because they are not negotiating in good faith they will not give to us whatever it is in the agreement because their purpose is to change the charter
1573695 why do it now in the last 2 minutes of this government if they really want to come up with that kind of agreement they could have done that a long time ago
1573696 the issues involved here are so much higher that i think its but right that the sc issued its tro i think eventually the real agreement will be brought to light
1573697 this only showed us that importing rice is not cheaper and the world market cant be trusted
1573698 because of insufficient rice production which is supposedly the area of concern of the department of agriculture the nfa is made to import rice as an answer for the production shortfall
1573699 nfa is made to pay for the tariffs and other related expenses nfa is blamed for the rice crisis when actually it is not the culprit
1573700 the constitution ensure that food security is an integral part of a
1573701 there should also be adequate support to farmers and fisher folks through easy access to credit marketing assistance and extension services
1573702 personal devices such as cellphones and personal media players are preferred for the waiting room scenario however if there is more time available survey respondents preferred larger screens on products such mobile internet devices or ultra mobile pcs
1573703 clean enough to be healthy dirty enough to be happy
1573704 shes been drunk for hours you might want to cut her off
1573705 john has really been doting on her i mean the presents phone calls romantic dinners hes laying it on thick it all makes jen feel really important and special
1573706 through our contribution of almost 1 million in software our goal is to equip every single household in this community with all of the tools they need to access and be citizens of the internet
1573707 i am taking off the old crown and you may hear some crunching
1573708 huh huh mess about with the hue and saturation theyll never notice
1573709 we have taken customer feedback in account and the sizes are now more loose
1573710 get big fast damn the cost be brave go over the cliff the competition doesnt have the
1573711 china is a freer better richer place than it was when it was awarded the games
1573712 but actually at closer examination what seemed to come through was firstly its more to do with things like opening up the economy as a whole
1573713 i would have bought sproule on first and left johnson on the bench
1573714 innovative companies are exploring opportunities for expanding mobile messaging access to web sites as well as targeting customers with content and ads
1573715 to be successful with these enhanced services companies that supply mobile messaging products and services must understand the regional distributions for customer type payment preferences message delivery method and usage
1573716 device vendors and messaging platform suppliers serving the global market will have to manage across markets where growth is king and other markets where product differentiation is king
1573717 so you play for man city and man utd like denis law not like that dennis well go for a drink soon as friends
1573718 the very embodiment of manchester united for much of the 80s and 90s
1573719 nothing better than to cross things out of my to do lists
1573720 weirdos without a life who dont have anything better to do with their time
1573721 so yes business and making money is important in football but the question is where that money goes afterwards out or back into the club
1573722 also ignores it when contributors point out his glaring errors about things like the st waiting list there isnt one the open ended repayment schedule of the debt no it isnt and 30 million of annual dividends arent being paid to shareholders so paying more than twice that in debt intreest per annum is ok dividends never approached anything like 30m pa
1573723 the open ended repayment schedule of the debt no it isnt
1573724 but some of us clearly not you think those who should be there ought to be based on loyalty and passion rather than annual income
1573725 this number exceeds the glazers ebitda target in their refinancing business plan of 73 8m by less than the amount raised by the ticket price rises and the compulsory automatic cup scheme membership for all season ticket holders why continue to make it painful for loyal supporters when you have already met your target
1573726 clearly the higher revenues are mainly driven by the cash being generated from fans at the stadium
1573727 the tax efficiency of interest over dividends is an empty argument so we pay 60m in interest less 20m in tax benefit we are still 40m worse off and the debt still remains
1573728 do you honestly believe uniteds balance sheet is more secure today than it was pre takeover
1573729 so united made 3m in the last year despite having won the league and without hardly spending a penny on players nani anderson and tevez are yet to be paid for and smith rossi etc all brought funds in and still barely broke even
1573730 secondly how do you think private equity deals work the glazers have stumped up some small proportion of the total amount used to buy the club and borrowed the rest if the club falls in value and they cant make the payments on the mortgage they lose their stake to cover the shortfall this happens as soon as the banks worry that theyre in any danger
1573731 a couple of arguments i am raising here will united go bankrupt well no unless the glazers are bankrupt it is inconceivable for me though some lawyers likely can pointout some loophole that this can happen that an asset can be bankrupt with its owner rich its like a house and its mortgage it is negative in value but that is barely relative to the wealth of the owner
1573732 if we have a bad few seasons thats when the death spiral starts faliure on the feild will give rise to smaller attendances maybe not at first but say we had five years without a trophy new players would not come and the fans might think twice about stumping up ever increasing prices to pay for glazer debt and less sales of merchandise then the banks begin to sweat united could seriousy be in great peril all of a sudden we cannot pay the interest bill and the problem compounds if the club does go bust yes the glazers lose but exactly what have they lost little except for face the banks have given them the money
1573733 have you forgotten how far and how fast leeds fell when there debts and failure on the feild took cont
1573734 i would be grateful if the glazer apologists could explain exactly how united paying out circa 60m in interest each year is good for the club
1573735 i cant go see my team more than once in a blue moon
1573736 baring in mind we have the largest stadium and the highest revenue from performance related payments ie winning trophies surely we should have the cheapest tickets in the league
1573737 any money united have spent on players has not come from the glazers it is borrowed money from banks that still has to be paid back
1573738 there have been 23 suicide bomb attacks carried out by women in iraq so far this year compared to eight attacks for the whole of 2007 the u s military says last week on july 28 three women wearing explosive vests mingled with shiite religious pilgrims in baghdad and blew themselves up a fourth bomber also believed to have been a woman struck kurds protesting against a disputed election law in the north of the country in all they killed nearly 60 people in the deadliest single day in iraq for months nearly 250 people were wounded analysts say many women are motivated by a thirst for revenge for family members killed or captured others may be determined to show that they are as committed to the cause as any man
1573739 i remember my caution in wearing the dress i knew those bows were precarious
1573740 sei que temos as horas e os dias contados mas o tempo das paix es n o conta estou te enviando um enxame de girass is e o teu antial rgico contra a poeira dos desatinos send me a letter send me a postcard
1573741 his behaviour i dont like it he wants everyone to do what he wants and i have told him so
1573742 its funny how sometimes in life you have to go backwards to feel satisfaction
1573743 starting playing in clubs again and having a brand new label and doing things fresh is definitely filling the void that was inside
1573744 hiatus is not a word daron likes to use while myself and members of system like to use that word daron uses the notion of separation and he is right at this point in time were separated there has to be four people that want to get back together not just one or two
1573745 if some day it feels right for us to do then well do it but as of right now im really focussed on this i want to take this to different levels and so does daron we dont talk about system we dont talk about doing system if it does happen i see it being very very far down the line at the same time this album is a great linking album for system fans fans will enjoy this because as daron was a principle songwriter in system there are many of the same sounds ambient and musical textures that relate back to the system sounds but we cant escape that factor as musicians
1573746 im a drummer man i was at a comic book convention in la because my ex girlfriend was a playmate and she was doing a signing i bumped into this young girl who would have been fourteen or fifteen and she started crying i thought i must have injured her but she was just a big fan thats special too because in many bands no one even knows the drummers name let alone would recognise him in a crowd of thousands
1573747 sometimes i wonder if daron will ever get be satisfied with the music he has created he is always pushing himself to reach new heights scars on broadway is daron pushing further then he ever went on a system album he was the one pushing the buttons and making this album work
1573748 its a pretty eclectic album with a lot of attitude
1573749 daron got the name from these light posts where we live in la the light posts have swastikas engraved in the design its something that if you lived in the city i live in when you went to high school youd always hear kids talk about it and theyre on broadway their kind of scarred into the posts which is how he got the name
1573750 it would have no racial meaning but people arent to know that and its a sad fact that society will can at times assume the worst of a situation
1573751 when it comes to relating what the songs are about its almost like all the world is a stage and we are the scars on broadway the name sparked a different vision in my head for what it meant
1573752 we dont think about that too much to be honest with you
1573753 im not sure what our rep is as it is my goal is to continue to write songs that im proud of and hopefully in turn will touch somebody out there
1573754 we get up on stage and people see this is a for real band and something to be taken seriously on its own away from system
1573755 there are songs for me that are like the fabric of my life if those songs didnt exist then i couldnt imagine my life without them theyre such a big part of our existence today so for my music to do that to people its special to me its cool to be a part of so many peoples lives even if i dont know them i feel like im contributing something positive to the world in my time through my songs
1573756 with system we played the big day out festival twice and we also played our some of our own shows on off days of the festival right now we are working it into our plans as we would love to come back down there in your summer and play the big day out again
1573757 we have our people talking to their people and i can promise you this if it can be done it will be done
1573758 a great writer is so to speak a second government in his country and for that reason no regime has ever loved great writers only minor ones
1573759 speeches that made a difference aleksandr solzhenitsyns a world split apart
1573760 its not like it used to be but it will do
1573761 i can see a last minute bid made for him on transfer deadline day
1573762 the supporters might even give you the benefit of the doubt for a change
1573763 tunaikan nadzarmu karena sesungguhnya tidak boleh melaksanakan nadzar dalam maksiat terhadap alloh dan dalam hal yang tidak dimiliki oleh anak adam
1573764 alif lam mim inilah alkitab yang tidak ada keraguan didalamnya petunjuk bagi orang orang yang bertaqwa yaityu yang beriman dengan hal hal yang ghoib
1573765 kemudian sesudah itu sesungguhnya kalian benar benar akan mati kemudian sensungguhnya kamu sekalian akan dibangkitakan dari kuburmu dihari kiamat
1573766 pada hari kiamat manusia dikumpulkan dalam keadaan tanpa alas kaki telanjang dan tanpa dihitan
1573767 adapun orang yang diberi kitabnya dari sebelah kanan maka dia akan dihitung amalnya dengan perhitungan yang mudah dan dia akan kembali kepada kaumnyadengan tgembira
1573768 kami akan memasang timbangan yang tepat adil pada hari kiamat maka tiadalah dirugikan seseorang sedikitpun dan jika amalan itu hanya sebesar biji sawi pun pasti kami mendatangkan pahala nya dan cukuplah kami sebagai pembuat perhitungan
1573769 sesungguhnya orang orang yang beriman dan beramal saleh maka balasan bagi mereka adalah tinggal di dalam surga surga firdaus
1573770 sesungguhnya orang orang yang kafir terhadap ayat ayat kami maka mereka pasti akan kami masukkan ke dalam neraka
1573771 maka tidaklah ada jiwa yang mengetahui balasan yang disembunyikan pengetahuannya terhadap mereka yaitu keindahan yang menyejukkan mata sebagai balasan atas apa yang telah mereka kerjakan
1573772 dan muhammad sungguh telah pernah melihatnya malaikat jibril di kesempatan lainnya yaitu tatkala berada di sidratul muntaha yang di sisinya terdapat surga yang akan ditinggali
1573773 sungguh aku telah menyaksikan dari tempatku ini segala sesuatu yang dijanjikan untuk kalian sampai sampai aku bisa melihat diriku sendiri hendak memetik dedaunan yang ada di surga tatkala kalian melihatku maka akupun maju
1573774 seandainya kalian melihat apa yang aku lihat niscaya kalian akan lebih banyak menangis daripada tertawa aku melihat surga dan neraka
1573775 sesungguhnya salah seorang di antara kalian jika meninggal maka akan ditampakkan kepadanya tempat duduknya di surga atau di neraka pada waktu pagi dan petang
1573776 inilah tempat dudukmu engkau akan melihatnya sampai allah membangkitkan dirimu pada hari kiamat nanti
1573777 sungguh aku telah melihat api neraka itu saling melahap satu sama lain dan ketika kalian memergoki aku maka akupun mundur
1573778 aku lihat neraka belum pernah kusaksikan sebuah pemandangan yang lebih mengerikan daripada hari itu
1573779 kemudian apabila datang kepada mereka kemakmuran mereka berkata ini adalah karena usaha kami
1573780 tidak termasuk golongan kami orang yang melakukan atau meminta tathayyur meramal atau meminta diramalkan dan saya kira juga bersabda dan yang menyihir atau yang meminta disihirkan
1573781 barangsiapa yang kepercayaan thiyarahnya mengurungkan hajat yang hendak dilakukannya maka ia telah berlaku syirik mereka bertanya wahai rasululloh apa kaffarat tebusan dari padanya
1573782 ya alloh tiada kebaikan kecuali kebaikan dari engkau tiada kesialan kecuali kesialan dari engkau dan tidak ada sembahan yang hak selain engkau
1573783 dan tiada seorangpun di antara kita kecuali telah terjadi dalam jiwanya sesuatu dari hal ini hanya saja allah menghilangkannya dengan tawakkal kepadanya
1573784 karena engkau telah menghukum saya tersesat saya benar benar akan menghalang halangi mereka dari jalan engkau yang lurus
1573785 dan apabila kamu ditimpa bahaya di lautan niscaya hilanglah siapa yang kamu seru kecuali dia maka tatkala dia menyelamatkan kamu ke daratan kamu berpaling dan manusia itu adalah selalu tidak berterima kasih
1573786 dan apabila manusia itu ditimpa kemudharatan dia memohon pertolongan kepada tuhannya dengan kembali kepada nya kemudian apabila tuhan memberikan nikmat nya kepadanya lupalah dia akan kemudharatan yang pernah dia berdoa kepada alloh untuk menghilangkannya sebelum itu dan dia mengada adakan sekutu sekutu bagi alloh untuk menyesatkan manusia dari jalan nya katakanlah bersenang senanglah dengan kekafiranmu itu sementara waktu sesungguhnya kamu termasuk penghuni neraka
1573787 hanya bagi alloh lah hak mengabulkan doa yang benar dan sesuatu yang mereka sembah selain allah tidak dapat memperkenankan sesuatupun bagi mereka melainkan seperti orang yang membukakan kedua telapak tangannya ke dalam air supaya sampai air ke mulutnya padahal air itu tidak dapat sampai ke mulutnya dan doa ibadah orang orang kafir itu hanyalah sia sia belaka
1573788 katakanlah siapakah yang memberi rezki kepadamu dari langit dan bumi atau siapakah yang kuasa menciptakan pendengaran dan penglihatan dan siapakah yang mengeluarkan yang hidup dari yang mati dan mengeluarkan yang mati dari yang hidup dan siapakah yang mengatur segala urusan maka mereka akan menjawab alloh maka katakanlah mengapa kamu tidak bertakwa kepada nya
1573789 kami tidak menyembah mereka melainkan supaya mereka mendekatkan kami kepada alloh dengan sedekat dekatnya
1573790 sesungguhnya orang orang munafik itu menipu alloh dan alloh akan membalas tipuan mereka dan apa bila mereka berdiri untuk shalat mereka berdiri dengan malas mereka bermaksud riya dengan shalat di hadapan allah dan tidaklah mereka menyebut allah kecuali sedikit sekali
1573791 barangsiapa melakukan perbuatan sumah niscaya allah akan menyebarkan aibnya dan barang siapa melakukan perbuatan riya niscaya allah akan menyebarkan aibnya
1573792 ku adalah sekutu yang maha cukup sangat menolak perbuatan syirik barangsiapa melakukan suatu amal dengan dicampuri perbuatan syirik kepadaku niscaya aku tinggalkan dia dan tidak aku terima amal syiriknya
1573793 para nabi dakwah pertama dan tujuan terbesar mereka di setiap masa adalah meluruskan aqidah keyakinan terhadap alloh subhanahu wa taala
1573794 katakanlah aku tidak berkuasa menarik kemanfaatan bagi diriku dan tidak pula menolak kemudharatan kecuali yang dikehendaki alloh dan sekiranya aku mengetahui yang ghaib tentulah aku membuat kebajikan sebanyak banyaknya dan aku tidak akan ditimpa kemudharatan aku tidak lain hanyalah pemberi peringatan dan membawa berita gembira bagi orang orang yang beriman
1573795 janganlah kalian berlebih lebihan memuji menyanjung diriku sebagaimana orang orang nasrani berlebih lebihan memuji ibnu maryam isa sesungguhnya aku adalah hamba allah maka katakanlah hamba allah dan rasulnya
1573796 apabila engkau meminta maka mintalah kepada alloh dan apabila engkau memohon pertolongan maka mohonlah pertoongan dari alloh
1573797 wahai dzat yang hidup kekal lagi terus menerus mengurus makhluknya dengan rahmatmu aku memohon pertolongan
1573798 ya alloh aku memintamu untuk menghilangkan kesusahan kami dan kesusahan ini tiada yang bisa menghapusnya kecuali engkau ya alloh
1573799 maha suci engkau tidak ada yang layak ditakuti kecuali menurut hak ketakutan kepada mu
1573800 tetapi orang orang yang bersumpah atas nama ku justru berbuat dusta dan mereka tidak mengetahui hal ini
1573801 mataku tidak pernah berhenti menangis semenjak allah menciptakan neraka jahannam karena aku takut akan mendurhakai nya lalu dia akan melemparkan aku kedalamnya
1573802 sesungguhnya alloh mempunyai para malaikat yang berada disekitar arsy mata mereka menangis layaknya sungai hingga hari kiamat tiba mereka bergetar seakan diguncang angin karena takut kepada allah
1573803 wahai para malaikat ku apa yang membuat kalian takut sementara kalian ada disisi ku
1573804 ya rabbi andaikata penghuni bumi melihat kemuliaan dan keagungan engkau seperti yang kami lihat ini tentu mereka tidak sanggup makan dan minum tidak sanggup tidur lalu mereka keluar ke tengah padang pasir untuk menguak di sana seperti sapi yang menguak
1573805 tatkala neraka diciptakan maka jantung para malaikat lepas dari tempatnya lalu tatkala adam diciptakan jantung mereka pun kembali ke tempatnya semula
1573806 but club insiders and those in the know are fully aware this is despite them not because of them
1573807 dulu aku melarang kalian semua berziarah kubur maka sekarang berziarahlah
1573808 alloh melaknat orang orang yahudi dan nashrani yang telah menjadikan kubur para nabi mereka sebagai masjid
1573809 katakanlah siapakah yang memberi rezki kepadamu dari langit dan bumi atau siapakah yang kuasa menciptakan pendengaran dan penglihatan dan siapakah yang mengeluarkan yang hidup dari yang mati dan mengeluarkan yang mati dari yang hidup dan siapakah yang mengatur segala urusan maka mereka akan menjawab alloh maka katakanlah mengapa kamu tidak betakwa kepada nya
1573810 tidaklah kami menyembah mereka melainkan agar mereka dapat mendekatkan kami kepada alloh dengan sedekat dekatnya
1573811 mereka menjadikan orang orang alimnya dan rahib rahib mereka sebagai tandingan tuhan selain alloh
1573812 bukankah mereka mengharamkan apa yang dihalalkan oleh alloh lalu kalian pun ikut mengharamkan dan bukankah mereka menghalalkan apa yang diharamkan oleh alloh lalu kalian pun ikut menghalalkan
1573813 dan diantara manusia ada orang orang yang menyembah tandingan tandingan selain alloh mereka mencintainya sebagaimana mereka mencintai alloh adapun orang orang yang beriman amat sangat cintanya kepada alloh
1573814 mari silakan masuk ajari dan pengaruhi keluarga kami dengan acara acara syirik bidah dan maksiat kalian
1573815 dan apabila dikatakan kepada mereka ikutilah apa yang telah diturunkan alloh mereka menjawab tidak tetapi kami hanya mengikuti apa yang telah kami dapati dari perbuatan nenek moyang kami apakah mereka akan mengikuti juga walaupun nenek moyang mereka itu tidak mengetahui suatu apapun dan tidak mendapat petunjuk
1573816 dan tetaplah beri peringatan karena peringatan itu memberikan manfaat terhadap orang orang yang beriman
1573817 pengetahuan ilmu tentang hal itu ada pada tuhanku di dalam sebuah kitab tuhanku yang tidak akan salah dan tidak pula lupa
1573818 barangsiapa yang dirinya dikehendaki kebaikan oleh alloh subhanallohu wa taala maka akan alloh subhanallohu wa taala pahamkan dia tentang ilmu agama
1573819 alloh subhanallohu wa taala akan meninggikan orang orang yang beriman diantara kalian dan orang orang yang diberi ilmu beberapa derajat
1573820 menuntut ilmu syari adalah kewajiban bagi setiap muslim baik laki laki ataupun wanita
1573821 sesungguhnya para nabi tidaklah mewariskan dinar maupun dirham harta benda akan tetapi hanyalah mereka mewariskan ilmu syari maka barangsiapa yang mengambilnya sungguh dia mengambil bagian warisan yang banyak
1573822 mereka hanya mengetahui yang lahir saja dari kehidupan dunia sedang mereka tentang kehidupan akherat adalah lalai
1573823 sesungguhnya alloh subhanallohu wa taala membenci setiap orang yang alim pandai dalam perkara duniawi namun jahil terhadap perkara akherat
1573824 tidaklah seseorang pergi siang hari ke masjid untuk kebaikan yang akan dipelajarinya atau diajarkannya melainkan akan ditulis untuknya pahala sebagaimana pahala mujahid ia tidak pulang melainkan dalam keadaan mendapatkan rampasan perang
1573825 barangsiapa yang keluar untuk menuntut ilmu agama ia berada di jalan alloh subhanallohu wa taala hingga ia pulang
1573826 hendaklah kalian menuntut ilmu agama karena mempelajarinya dengan ikhlash membuat orang takut kepada alloh subhanallohu wa taala mengkajinya adalah ibadah dan mendiskusikannya adalah tasbih dan pergi mencarinya adalah jihad
1573827 barangsiapa yang mengharap perjumpaan dengan tuhannya maka hendaknya ia mengerjakan amal yang sholeh dan janganlah ia mempersekutukan seorangpun dalam beribadah kepada tuhannya
1573828 barangsiapa yang mengerjakan suatu amalan yang bukan merupakan perintah kami maka amal tersebut tertolak
1573829 ketahuilah ilmuilah bahwa sesungguhnya tidak ada sesembahan yang benar untuk disembah kecuali hanya alloh subhanallohu wa taala dan mohonlah ampunan atas dosamu
1573830 alloh tidak ditanya tentang apa yang diperbuat nya namun merekalah yang akan ditanya
1573831 whoa got into a car accident got totally shitfaced gave juli her birthday lap dance stayed up till five and fed a racoon with tom beronicas car broke down begged for money and earned 17 00 thanks to brigdet sat in a car for 5 hours and watched elk rescued by uncle kurt home best birthday party ever juli complety not sarcastic i love my friends
1573832 this is going to be the beginning for him its going to be exciting but him and mckay are going to tag team it
1573833 i asked for a reason and they said we dont give reasons
1573834 i said who else can i speak to about this and they said there is no other recourse
1573835 im not surprised they did this because they said they were going to keep out activists
1573836 but these are legitimate olympians with a history with the olympics id sure like to know what the international olympic committee has to say about this i think its really disappointing
1573837 anderson did not stop or seize any of the messages that were forwarded to him
1573838 andersons actions did not halt the transmission of the messages to their intended recipients as such under well settled case law as well as a reading of the statute and the ordinary meaning of the word intercept andersons acquisitions of the e mails did not violate the wiretap act
1573839 the information was obtained in a legal manner from a confidential informant who we believe obtained the information legally
1573840 the case is alarming because its implications will reach far beyond a single civil case

1573863 it should be a clarion call to women and men in this country that a kind of extremist view has begun to take hold to make even birth control and contraception more difficult to secure and that it could lead to the same kind of stigmatization that has existed in the case of abortion

1573950 whenever and wherever the study mission talked with greek cypriot refugees the story was basically the same people moved the instant they saw or thought the turkish army was advancing towards their town or village
1573951 greek cypriots fled the moment there was rumor or sight of military forces creating a virtual vacuum into which the turkish army could and did move without resistance and without the presence of people
1573952 at the first opportunity we get the greek cypriot national guard will attack and regain by force of arms our occupied lands

1574016 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
1574017 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
1574018 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
1574019 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
1574020 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
1574021 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
1574022 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
1574023 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
1574024 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
1574025 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
1574026 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
1574027 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
1574028 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
1574029 after one look at this webcam who would want to play an outdoor game of hoops in beijing

1574035 the rupee is fairly strong as oil prices are down the stocks opened positive and are likely to stay like that
1574036 when im big like the dq i can go to camp right right right daddy right
1574037 as the domestic and external uncertainties rise worries about a sharper than expected economic slowdown loom large and the government has changed its tone on macro policy recently
1574038 if we dont get a strong number oil prices will likely fall further
1574039 elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1574040 i expect prices to fall to between us 100 and us 110 by the end of the year
1574041 technical wise its oversold i do believe we will see some relief buying within the next one week
1574042 investors or speculators have entered the market but at this moment buying is not big
1574043 anyway platinum prices have decreased so much so anytime automobile companies change their minds they will start to buy little by little
1574044 market participants who are still long might be looking for opportunity to offload their positions that are above 900
1574045 any spike towards 900 will be met by selling pressure for those who want to get out of their stale positions
1574046 prices will remain on the downward trend but i dont think they will fall that much but be rangebound around 118 120 a barrel
1574047 our biggest worries are nigeria the hurricane season etc we cannot relax too much there is very robust demand in china india and the middle east
1574048 im very happy and honoured to have stretched my career out for as long as i did

1574053 ive studied latin and spanish and im currently trying to teach myself ancient greek
1574054 to infer that the soviet terror is as hideous as hitlerism is not only a brutal oversimplification but a moral indecency
1574055 we are delighted to have both alan and mark on board with ireland said kidney
1574056 both of them are extremely strong technical coaches in their areas and i think they will bring a further positive mix to the coaching team and squad
1574057 alan brings with him experience of both international and most importantly irish rugby
1574058 mark is recognised as one of the top kicking coaches in the world and his experience of working with the squad in the past will help with the transition over the next number of weeks
1574059 ill tell you what autism is its a brat that hasnt been told to cut the act out

1574067 i just came back from 4weeks of rehab at the massie unit of the finan center in cumberland it was a good program they talk about relapse triggers relapse prevention stress management etc
1574068 the military recruitment of children under the age of 17 however is a clear violation of international law the u n optional protocol no attempt to recruit children 13 16 is allowed in the united states pursuant to treaty it is also important to consider the effects of the game within the context of the ongoing wars in iraq and afghanistan undoubtedly soldiers now recruited through americas army will serve in these wars the invasions and occupations of iraq and afghanistan are violations of international law and contributing to their continuation through the propagation of the game is if not a criminal violation a moral outrage
1574069 ubisofts role as publisher of americas army is contributing to an international crime but you are not alone gameloft is working on the cell phone application and secret level was a developer of the 2005 version of the game is child recruitment recruitment to fight the cause of dubious wars the proper business of your company and those of you in their employ
1574070 end their contracts with the military stop work on the game and make public pronouncements in writing to that effect
1574071 who they choose as their president is the americans business
1574072 artificially prolonging the tenure of u s troops in iraq would cause problems
1574073 so far the americans have had trouble agreeing to a concrete timetable for withdrawal because they feel it would appear tantamount to an admission of defeat
1574074 but that isnt the case at all if we come to an agreement it is not evidence of a defeat but of a victory of a severe blow we have inflicted on al qaida and the militias
1574075 dont want to stifle what school districts are doing in classrooms

1574081 i told the president im concerned about north koreas human rights record im concerned about uranium enrichment activities as well as nuclear testing and proliferation and ballistic missile programmes
1574082 the best way to appoach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1574083 this was our worst effort i wouldnt say effort this is our worst performance
1574084 i dont think we were as sharp as we have been i dont think we played very well or not up to what we can play
1574085 we are not happy at all with the way we played i think we could have done much better
1574086 we are going to play much better defense i think you have to give some credit to the australian team because they executed very well
1574087 we broke down on defense and let the other team get open looks
1574088 we cant have mental breakdowns like those because these teams are tough and really know how to shoot the ball
1574089 the last two games the ball has been sticking a little bit so we have to get back to looking like the first games where everybody was touching the ball and we were playing like we should

1574137 retiree fees ought to relate to how much the plan is worth
1574138 the higher value plans should have higher premiums associated with them
1574139 they ought to reflect how much income an individual has so that if they make more money and are therefore better able to pay for a system they should do so
1574140 when tricare started out in 1995 military members retirees were charged 230 per individual 460 per family
1574141 today in 2008 theyre charged 230 per individual 460 per family
1574142 essentially what this says to you is that we are asking our older retirees who are in fact the least likely to hold jobs and therefore have the lowest incomes to pay the most for their system
1574143 we believe we need to get some parity between our older and our younger retirees
1574144 we believe that the under 65 retirees should begin paying 40 percent of the medicare part b premium using the same fee structure that is laid on by the medicare system
1574145 in addition we believe that the under 65 retirees who elect to use tricare standard and extra need to pay a small fee for that
1574146 and we would suggest to the department that that fee be set at 15 percent of the medicare part b we think the family rate should be set at double the individual rate and that the premium increase needs to be phased in over four years
1574147 the views expressed by michael savage are his views and are not those of wor radio we regret any consternation that his remarks may have caused to our listeners

1574153 during the week following the games our american team was involved in continuous fetes we were shown about the country by the three princes took dinner with them went to dances and cotillions at the american ministers russian ministers and elsewhere and in our progress through the streets were greeted with cries of nike nike victor victor small shopkeepers insisted that we enter their stores and accept neckties handkerchiefs etc for which they refused to accept payment and which we were warned we should accept in order not to cause hurt feelings
1574154 i work hard for those moments i like those moments its special today
1574155 it changes the game more so than his ability to hit the ball out of the ballpark he loosens us up with his charisma and character before and after the game hes a huge part of who we are
1574156 it was as positive a quarter as you can get in this market
1574157 i didnt want to see police follow me every day
1574158 its cheaper than a taxi i dont have to pay

1574160 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1574161 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1574162 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1574163 the main thing with the olympics is to show people that we exist
1574164 estoy 80 por ciento seguro de que voy por el doblete
1574165 me he estado entrenando como si fuera a correr el doblete
1574166 were still growing were still going to get better as each game goes on but i think tonight we learned something
1574167 it looks like theres not a lot separating us it was a great dress rehearsal for beijing
1574168 im working hard to be at my best gay said
1574169 when i step on the line in beijing dont worry ill be ready
1574170 i just couldnt believe it if i havent been playing very well this scenario wouldnt have never happened so to me it was a compliment and i enjoyed it
1574171 ive been able to win 12 times out here but ive never been able to get it done in a major
1574172 puttings always held me back for the past three months i putted better than i ever putted in my life period if i putt somewhere near like i putted this summer ive got a great shot this week
1574173 set my goals to make that ryder cup team and blew right through that this summer now im trying to get refocused here and get re energized for september
1574174 it just taught me i need to set more goals in my life my only goal was to make the ryder cup team thats all i focused in on this year
1574175 no creo que pueda hacerlo creo que no lo har miren la competencia
1574176 hay mucha gente esperando ver hacer historia pero la mayor competencia en muchos de los eventos vendr de sus compatriotas

1574180 en dos a os si el guadalajara permanece este equipo va a estar complicado ganarles pero ahora todav a no tiene plantel para llegar a ser campeones no lo creo
1574181 guadalajara trabaja un buen proyecto pero puede pagar la factura por la novatez de muchos de sus jugadores ellos trabajan as y quiz les falte algo de experiencia tienen jugadores como ram n morales h ctor reynoso jonny magall n y gonzalo pineda que son los que le dan equilibrio
1574182 la din mica que es la ventaja de chivas no les funcion para el segundo tiempo por lo que les ganamos bien y aplicamos un futbol m s inteligente
1574183 en dos a os si permanece este equipo va a estar complicado ganarles pero ahora todav a no tiene plantel para llegar a ser campeones no lo creo
1574184 tenemos un grupo de mayor experiencia que chivas guadalajara es m s joven que corre mucho pero solamente corriendo no se gana un partido hay que tener un poco de inteligencia la tuvimos y fuimos mejores con un hombre menos

1574187 were getting used to it though and the feeling in the team is good
1574188 i learned a lot in my first season with real
1574189 i used to watch makaay when i was a little boy and i never dreamed i would get to play with a legend like this
1574190 i had the chance to play with him at feyenoord and now were wearing the orange shirt together its amazing
1574191 were not little boys we u 23 guys play for big clubs you know
1574192 but a guy like roy makaay will stop you in training and say hey slow it down or no do it this way and you cant help but be grateful for it
1574193 nigeria will play physical but we just need to keep the ball on the ground get it out wide move it around and break them down that way the dutch way
1574194 i want to score goals and make my teammates happy make the people back home happy all that good stuff

1574197 en s hubo dos movimientos tambi n michel cuenta con la comunicaci n no quiero decir que checo rodr guez no hable pero nos conoc amos de alguna manera nuestras deficiencias nuestras virtudes y tenemos que reconocer que no hemos estado tan seguros
1574198 hemos fallado muchos pases sencillos vimos el partido contra barcelona y hay que aprenderles a ellos que no salen de una l nea no quiero profundizar porque parecer a t cnico pero son cosas que hay que aprenderles sabemos que es uno de los equipos grandes del mundo y no nos queda m s que callarnos y aprender
1574199 me preocupa respecto a los primeros dos partidos del torneo porque no le hemos podido dar seguridad al equipo para ir al frente para atacar como lo hac a hab amos recibidos tres goles en dos partidos y eso es para analizarlo
1574200 ha sido un poco dif cil adaptarse a la defensa me ha costado un poquito pero me siento con la capacidad de responder en esa posici n y claro se queda muy presente el error ante tecos el cual asumo con responsabilidad y bueno voy a luchar y demostrar lo que s hacer
1574201 ha sido un arranque que no esper bamos nosotros m s que preocuparnos nos ocupamos por corregir los errores que hemos cometido estamos conscientes de lo que estamos dejando de hacer as que hay que hacer un autoan lisis
1574202 nos preocupa todo los cinco ante barcelona al final son goles lo que digo es la forma el sistema que nosotros manejamos es lo que hemos dejado de hacer el concretar pases nos da mucha tranquilidad y tenemos que mejorar porque es el a b c
1574203 no quiero hablar m s de esto el caso est cerrado es jugador del manchester united y se ha terminado

1574206 ya tuve la oportunidad de no poder dormir dos d as pensando en el partido en lo que pude hacer y no hice obviamente no se puede defender lo indefendible fue un mal partido una mala noche y no puedo agachar la cabeza tengo que darle vuelta a la p gina y seguir trabajando
1574207 me encantar a volver a jugar creo que hasta antes de este partido ven a haciendo las cosas bien y demostrando buenas cosas si me dan la oportunidad voy a morirme en la cancha no la voy a desaprovechar y ah tomar mi revancha
1574208 siempre hay incertidumbre porque sabemos que nadie en atlas tiene el puesto ganado yo les comentaba que debemos ir d a a d a y hasta que el profe d la lista podr saber si juego o no yo s que existe la posibilidad de que no pero ojal que s para demostrar
1574209 habl con todos al finalizar el partido todos se me acercaron y me dijeron que levantara la cabeza lo m s pronto posible que no hab a pasado nada fue su manera de apoyarme y de que no cayera que estuviera tranquilo y que siguiera trabajando todos me han apoyado
1574210 yo me siento bien y estoy preparado pero esta puerta se abre tambi n para mend vil pacheco y flavio estamos varios jugadores peleando un puesto y hay que trabajar porque el que tiene que salir beneficiado es el equipo
1574211 el que sea que est jugando siempre va a dar lo mejor de s uno hace lo que le piden en la cancha y siempre se trata de aportar y dar todo sabemos que las oportunidades se dan y si me toca tengo que aprovecharla para ganarme la titularidad y consolidarme

1574216 the idea of microsoft free personal computing has been in the air for a while
1574217 were just partnering with linux distribution vendors and hardware vendors to make it happen
1574218 our role is more on evangelizing and providing the necessary software for corporate needs
1574219 i think the need for alternatives to the microsoft dominated personal computing environment are there
1574220 were viewing this as an alternative to the microsoft small business server group of products
1574221 rather than talk about virtualization technology for an appliance were talking about something that is simple and has a small footprint
1574222 a lot of it shops lack the experience to quickly deploy a linux based cluster
1574223 by making this software stack available were trying to make cluster deployment faster
1574224 one of the new features is that it allows you to build custom servers
1574225 so users will only have the components that are necessary for running their particular application and this adds tremendously to the agility and flexibility of the system
1574226 there are also additional server monitoring tools included and overall deployment and system management has been streamlined
1574227 se le olvid mencionar que durante esos treinta a os 26 de ellos l estuvo en washington y l vot en contra de mayores est ndares de eficacia del combustible y se opuso a la legislaci n que incluy los cr ditos fiscales para coches m s eficientes

1574244 tambi n es momento de conciliar el pasado y el presente
1574245 hago un respetuoso pero en rgico llamado a los gobiernos estatales y locales para que nos pongamos de acuerdo y dediquemos nuestra actividad p blica y los recursos de la gente no para actividades pol ticas que dividen a los ciudadanos sino a los problemas que verdaderamente afectan a ellos

1574249 they were very inconsistent processes werent well published documented or followed what was happening was reasonably ad hoc not necessarily the best practice not necessarily consistent and not necessarily repeatable nor did we have an audit trail
1574250 our existing stand alone solution wasnt adequate for our needs as it didnt have that connection between what people were talking about and the actual physical equipment you would look up a persons name and you couldnt actually see the pc or equipment they were using to be able to look at the configuration of it
1574251 they set up an incident management a problem management and a change management team within the customer services area culturally it was very difficult for people to get their mind around but dell assisted us a lot in change management and mentoring roles
1574252 itil has completely revolutionised the way our customer service area deals with incident management one of the biggest problems we had was making sure the phones are actually answered and weve got data to suggest that no phones have gone unanswered in the last two months
1574253 itil allowed us to implement processes that everybody understands and follows and we can then trace back through those processes to see what people have done its revolutionised the way we do things and made sure those processes are repeatable and auditable

1574259 but i want anime to remain niche because it is special to me
1574260 im contemptuous of popular culture because i dont want to be like the others if anime becomes mainstream then i have to go somewhere else
1574261 how could anyone believe in such rubbish luckily im not brainwashed like them im special like the millions of other believers in my cult
1574262 this is something i like which is why we should keep others away from it
1574263 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
1574264 i am not so sure hes capable of backing off
1574265 i think hes kind of got a mind set which i think is the best way to race for a championship to go after it every week we wouldnt want to have him do anything other than try to win every race
1574266 im not a happy person when im not running well
1574267 you try to look forward at things and hopefully you can say that 13 is reasonable
1574268 it was pretty cool growing up and watching him and those times when he was able to run well and get those marks and think of the unbelievable seasons that he was having watching him when i was a kid
1574269 if theres a shot for it that would be pretty cool
1574270 when the chase starts theres going to be a different race going on
1574271 theres not going to be the race of going out for wins and doing pit strategy things and stuff like that which will take your chance out of a good top 10 or a good top five you just have to be consistent and stay up there in order to get those finishes
1574272 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
1574273 were trying to get the pga professional out front and into places where you traditionally wouldnt see golf
1574274 were trying to drive people to the golf course and pga professionals but you can also take the course and professional to the people
1574275 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
1574276 that machine is too old for something as intensive as that it should be upgraded or replaced it cant handle something like what youre trying to do
1574277 they are fueling the fire whether it is software or not
1574278 the problem is theyre advertising these unbelievably low premium health insurance plans
1574279 all youre doing its transferring risk to yourself so your monthly premiums are lower
1574280 are you smarter than gary sinises third grade best friend

1574287 temos que administrar a falta de jogadores e tornar o time competitivo
1574288 claro que estamos chateados mas melhor ser sexto do que ltimo
1574289 temos que continuar marcando em cima dos advers rios com a mesma dedica o apresentada contra a portuguesa e manter essa mobilidade mas n o podemos achar que o jogo contra o flamengo ser f cil aqui a gente respeita demais o flamengo e sabemos que teremos muitas dificuldades pela frente

1574310 i give my thanks to everybody in the media for not calling me about the race we had at indianapolis which was just a debacle that was just a horrible race i dont know what i would have said if somebody called me last week but im sure i would be apologizing for it today
1574311 ill say this and he may slap me and he can if he wants but he wasnt ready to win a championship i think until this year i think this year he can go head to head with jimmie johnson or tony stewart or with anybody else and i think he can close the deal the championship ultimately winds up normally being determined by how well you do when things go bad

1574314 the confidence will manifest itself in better pit stops than youll have if everybody is frustrated and dragging around theyll come together and bob will be able to get more energy out of them and be able to channel the energy in very positive ways
1574315 i wasnt aware about the shouting match but the crew chief is empowered in our world to make the final decision hes the captain of the ship the driver knows more about whats going on right in front of him as it relates to who has gone down pit road and who didnt go but bob made a courageous call he still needs to make that decision whatever he feels is right is what we need to do thats his job

1574507 he wasnt in the right mind set to play here
1574508 but one thing i was looking for out of that conversation was is he ready and committed to play football for the green bay packers and his answer frankly throughout the conversation was his mind set based on the things that have happened throughout this whole course was thats not where he was he wasnt in the right mind set to play here
1574509 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed
1574510 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it

1574525 no setbacks or anything i feel great and im just taking it day by day and im still doing a little exercise on it but for the most part it feels great
1574526 ive been champing at the bit ever since i got hurt last year i couldnt wait for training camp to start so when we strap it up saturday night against tampa bay im going to be real excited
1574527 hes looked very good back there were very pleased with where yeremiah is right now
1574528 hes the type of guy with a motor and something that weve been talking about is being the best and holding each other accountable
1574529 seeing where hes come from since hes been here having a role as a special teams player and then coming in as a starter is inspiring seeing how hard he works for a guy like myself and all the younger guys and even the older guys its good to see that we can push each other and hold each other accountable
1574530 its great because now were deep into camp and pretty much everybody knows what theyre doing
1574531 that makes my job a lot easier i just sit back there and if somebodys unsure then i just kind of call it out and help them out but there are cases when they help me out so were all talking communicating back there and getting everybody on the same page
1574532 yeah that was his first full day yesterday and that was the plan you know maybe to get him through a week and see how he did going one a day and then progressing to the two a day
1574533 yesterday was his first day of two a days so well see how it responds right now it sounds good but hes going out there for one today so thatll be three in a row well see how the thing goes tomorrow
1574534 yeah i think steve mckinney one of the intriguing things with steve is that he does provide some position flexibility in there
1574535 he has played guard and hes played center i think right now because hes been limited in reps getting him his center work with the line and getting all of the calls down and doing all of those things has been the most important thing but well take a look as we get on in this and maybe move him to guard
1574536 honestly i believe we were 1 15 and were trying to change a culture and in my mind we do need to go out and as a team we do need to be in the game environment
1574537 we need to get as many guys into uniform as we can get in uniform being in that locker room together coming out of that tunnel together be on the sideline together go through whatever were going to go through in that game together
1574538 ive been with bill a long enough time im not much on saving guys or doing any of those things well be smart if we have to be smart with some players our players know they need to play we need to get better
1574539 hey man its all preference some of these guys need to get rid of those dreads
1574540 they dont do a good job of taking care of them especially in training camp so theres a lot of smell going on in there some of those guys you dont know whats growing underneath that stuff but i dont see how they do it as hot as it is down here the clean look is the way to go
1574541 we got to go out to dinner last night and its great to have family out here no matter who you are its nice to have family members in the stands and he and i had a good talk last night hes been really helpful and been giving me a lot of advice and its been good having him out here

1574550 thats as a proof point and we will basically be first to market
1574551 if verified the discovery of these new populations of gorilla are hugely significant for our work as conservationists but we must not be distracted from the very real and present danger these gorillas are in from man and ebola
1574552 there is a danger that we concentrate on the more famous species
1574553 what about the other species that weve identified as in danger there are so many that are on the brink of extinction

1574555 in 1980 the population density of macaques was as much as 300 individuals per square kilometer in 10 years this had decreased to between 60 to 20 individuals per square kilometer
1574556 imagine the human population of the world reduced to that of one small town thats what we are talking about here
1574557 the habitats in which they live are largely impenetrable and we constantly find new species
1574558 having said that this the western lowland gorillas remains a unique find i dont know if well ever find something on this scale again
1574559 i think the lesson for conservationists today is that yes the world is full of surprises theres a lot of uncharted territory there in central africa there may be other populations
1574560 he soriano is a huge part of who were are
1574561 i dont want to say hes our spark plug because he bombs the ball out of the park but at the same time he gets us going

1574567 it makes a difference in a young girls life this is an example where government can do part of the job but one of the things that weve got to talk about and democrats sometimes and progressives we have to understand that government cant do everything
1574568 even as we fight the epidemic globally we must focus at home and i intend to do so with my foundation
1574569 i have been extremely disappointed with the clinton foundation especially with it headquartered in harlem of all places that it has been silent on this issue
1574570 im very grateful and it is appropriate that president clinton is committed to taking this on

1574586 tif is gong to run out the good times that weve enjoyed in the past are not going to be the same so we want to get these developments going while city resources are available
1574587 the university position all along has been that the best way to develop the market is to work in collaboration with all of the key stakeholders
1574588 theres a disconnect somewhere between the office of plannings very thoughtful careful approach and the deputy mayors approach and i find that very frustrating and discouraging
1574589 holy shit people are willing to read my lame ass blogs
1574590 for other masaajid in the world some of the fuqahaa have said that it is permissible due to the absence of any evidence to prohibit it while others said that it is not permissible making qiyaas with al masjid al haraam the correct position is that it is permissible when it has a sharee benefit or there is a need for it like the non mosleem hearing something that may lead him to enter into islam since the prophet muhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam tied up thumaamah ibn athaal al hanafy in the masjid before he accepted islaam and the delegation from thaqeef and one from the christians of najraan came to the masjid before they accepted islaam due to the numerous benefits in that like their hearing the addresses of the prophet shallallahu alaihi wa sallam and his admonitions their witnessing the people praying and reading al quran and other great benefits that do not reach someone who does not keep to the masjid and with allaah is the success and may allaahs salaah and salaam be upon our prophet and upon his family and companions

1574608 they dont like us florida guys because we fight back when we get picked on
1574609 a couple of years ago we had problems with the sheriff so we sued them and settled out of court for an undisclosed sum
1574610 the guys lawyer came back and took witness statements when the statements made it back to the sheriffs department they came by and asked me why i was getting involved
1574611 they would lie and wait for them to leave and then pull them over to see if they had been drinking
1574612 her husband who does drink was sitting in the passengers seat
1574613 i threw the phone back to my daughter and told her to keep taking photos
1574614 he started trying to get in my hummer and get to the back seat where my kids were i told him you better not go back there or else were going to have some real problems
1574615 he then turned to me and said im charging you with disorderly conduct

1574634 aku ingin membuat chelsea dicintai di seluruh dunia seperti barcelona dan manchester united aku terkejut karena orang bilang chelsea tidak populer karena saat kami pergi ke cina mereka cinta chelsea
1574635 ada banyak orang di sana adalah kejutan besar orang tidak menyukai kami di inggris di rusia di malaysia malah lebih baik lagi tapi mungkin belum di brasil atau amerika selatan
1574636 chelsea adalah sebuah klub yang namanya sedang berkembang sebelumnya itu adalah real madrid barcelona manchester united milan jika kami bisa memenangi satu atau dua kompetisi besar aku yakin kami akan punya fans di seluruh penjuru dunia
1574637 mungkin tak sama sepeti madrid manchester atau milan karena sejarah kami tidaklah sama dan anda tak bisa membuat sejarah dalam dua tiga atau sepuluh tahun mungkin dalam 20 atau 50 tahun chelsea baru akan ada di tingkat tersebut

1574663 i think this is a good idea no more goofing around just strictly business as far as education
1574664 as a parent i think its a great idea a lot of parents intend on dropping their kids off at school and then kids dodge class this would let us parents know more where they are
1574665 they confront their fears rather than allow them to overrule them
1574666 bombarded my mind but i persevered however after writing two books and countless published articles i now recognise it was simply fear trying to hold me back
1574667 i had a sense of being lost not being a part of something and it was difficult i was angry i was bitter it was building up inside of me
1574668 my ex husband and i had to face each other every day we worked together we owned a business together it was in front of me day after day and the anger i felt had to be controlled which im not real good at doing
1574669 i deal with my loneliness by turning to god because hes there
1574670 he would never leave me or forsake me hes my friend hes my father
1574671 a sound mind makes for a robust body but runaway emotions corrode the bones
1574672 i would go to bed and curl up into a ball and burrow down under the covers i felt like i was just a speck in this deep blackness almost like when you look up and you see a little star in the dark heavens at night cold and alone
1574673 some people thought i was dying they told me months later that they thought i had a terminal disease because i rarely spoke and id lost so much weight the loneliness was showing up on my face and in my demeanor i had once been a confident fun filled always finding something to laugh about kind of person all of a sudden i felt like a woman who was ninety years old and would be alone forever i saw no hope
1574674 once i reached the point where i began to let people close to me know what was going on in my life the loneliness began to dissipate but it took months

1574732 the concept of zero originated in ancient india this concept may seem to be a very ordinary one and a claim to its discovery may be viewed as queer but if one gives a hard thought to this concept it would be seen that zero is not just a numeral apart from being a numeral it is also a concept and a fundamental one at that it is fundamental because terms to identify visible or perceptible objects do not require much ingenuity
1574733 when we hold our ego we conquer the ego so we may easily come to the point of shunya nothingness the point of zero

1574757 are you planning on taking the boys to counseling this year because i dont want counseling to be one sided
1574758 earlier in the summer we received a newsletter from xxxx middle school it didnt contain any important information that we didnt already know but if you would still like to see it the newsletter is on the xxxx website for downloading since mrs h has several years experience teaching in middle schools we should be able to use that to our advantage this year which i think is great she says the middle schools tend to utilize technology more in keeping parents informed so the xxxx middle school website will be a useful tool it is website url in addition i know that mrs h sent you links to her calendar these online calendars automatically update from her calendar on her computer she is diligent about keeping this calendar up to date so if you check these calendars with any kind of regularity you will know everything we know as always if something arrives by mail that is important for us to pass along we will we have yet to receive anything from xxxx for youngest stepson
1574759 thanks for the great info i just wanted you to know thought that i wont be accessing mrs hs calendar i have way to much to keep track of without having to add checking in with that as well it is a kind offer but i dont see using it much as it will be too confusing to decifer things like boy time she marks boy time the same as i do and would only lead to further confusion i think that anything you all get school or activity info wise you can just let me know and i will do the same i think the lines of communication will be better served as well instead of relying on an internet schedule i would rather we talk

1574782 it is very disappointing that senator clinton seems determined to hedge her responses on the issues that matter most to the american people after six years of the bush administrations disastrous foreign policy the stakes in this election are too high
1574783 the american people deserve a president who will tell them the truth and offer straight answers not flip flops and political double speak
1574784 what ive said for a long time is that the united states of american should negotiate with iran
1574785 but its also the case that i do not believe the president of the united states should be party of such negotiations at this time

1574811 kids need to take their time and not be in such a hurry since may weve had 5 moped accidents and four of the drivers were transported to a hospital or clinic the biggest reasons for these accidents are driver inexperience and excessive speed they lose control when theyre turning
1574812 mopeds are more or less like a bicycle and are supposed to be within three feet of the curb whenever possible kids must obey all traffic laws and they will be cited if they break any they go to traffic court just like anybody else and they can lose their license depending on what the judge does
1574813 were starting to see more adults using them but they drive along the side of the road unlike the kids theyre just flying on these things and some of these mopeds can go 35 40 mph

1574941 the pensions crisis is becoming extremely personal when people are losing sleep over being unable to save enough for retirement
1574942 when the pressures of the current short term economic climate are added to the mix it is almost surprising that more of us are not lying awake at night worrying it is clear however that many of us are waking up to the idea that we have to take responsibility for our own retirements and that is a long term commitment
1574943 it is encouraging that this message is getting through and there is plenty that we can all do to ensure we get the planning for retirement that should involve more than simply saving into a pension but should also involve looking at all sources of income

1574946 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1574947 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1574948 typically when we have child labor issues its an issue of one or two individuals
1574949 from our point of view with this investigation its a large scale violation of the law
1574950 i needed money for my family because i could not help them

1574952 my first response is it doesnt surprise me because of all that i have heard
1574953 therefore i am grateful that this was brought to the attention of the proper authority and my hope would be that some sanctions would be taken because i do think that these young children were not treated with respect and they should not have been there in the first place

1574957 you can only win the tournament youre playing in you can only win the week youre playing and you can only beat the field that is there
1574958 so its irrelevant at the end of the day who is in the field
1574959 ive got to say jack nicklaus didnt play in the open championship and neither did arnold palmer or ben hogan
1574960 we can list a number of players the greats of the game that werent there
1574961 my second might have been third or whatever i dont know
1574962 might mean that im one place further up the leader board come sunday but i dont think it takes anything away from the tournament it is what it is i think its an opportunity for a lot of people to try to take advantage of the worlds no 1 not being in the golf tournament

1574971 i have played in my thirties and you dont get any slower as a player if you have a bad game people say its your age you are not allowed to be off form and that is one of the things you have to live with
1574972 but i think fabio has made it pretty clear to him beckham and everyone else that if you are in the squad and you deliver you will stay in
1574973 he will not be looking at your birth certificate or where you are playing he will look at what you are delivering for him that is all any manager can do
1574974 it was nice to see becks reach 100 caps because he has given great service to england over the last few years over half of them were as captain and he had inspirational moments where he lifted the side
1574975 we had a debate on it last week because during the summer we had tournaments going on and we wanted to touch base on it and see where we are at
1574976 we are hoping to have a technical meeting next month where we pin down exactly what the cycle of the year will look like if there are any planning changes we need to get them in sooner rather than later
1574977 the original schedule was about 24 months so you are looking at the latter part of 2010 if we are going to hit that we need to move quickly hopefully we will get the support from the local planners and we will not get a delay on when we can start
1574978 if public sector bodies are to cut the number of printers across their organisations and reduce printing they need to invest in document management systems these systems are crucial to achieving carbon neutrality by 2012 as they replace the printing out postage and manual filing of documents with electronic processes for document creation delivery management and storage
1574979 as each printer typically emits 456 kgs of carbon dioxide each year and each tree typically absorbs 13kg of co2 per year an incredible 35 trees need to be saved from destruction every year to offset just one office printers emissions when its also considered that every financial document arriving into an organisation is typically photocopied at least once and an invoice can be photocopied up to eleven times this creates a powerful case for implementing paperless processes
1574980 the floods of 2007 show just how serious flooding can be and i am glad to see that this project has been developed to enable people to have a greater understanding of the risk of flooding a number of decisions need to be taken when we look at managing the risk of flooding including our annual spend on flood defences where and how we build new houses and the emergency response procedures we have in place for times of flood this game gives the game player the opportunity to make informed decisions about all of these policy areas
1574981 we are extremely pleased to have been involved in this project this is a new way of making people aware of an issue of huge importance to the uk and we hope that players will not only enjoy the game but it will also encourage them to be more interested and engaged in the tough political decisions needed to deal with flood risk through the website we want people to respond to consultations write to their local mp find out their flood risk and make their voice heard
1574982 we are delighted to have worked with playgen on this project keeping this issue in the public eye is vital around 45 000 norwich union customers were affected by the floods in 2007 our job is twofold to put things right for our customers as quickly as possible and secondly work in partnership with the government agencies and the general public to ensure the uk is better prepared for the effects of flooding in future

1574987 there is no doubt that our students are highly talented and can offer a wide range of skills they are part of generation y or boomlets children of baby boomers and are the first to experience such high levels of debt characteristically they are self confident determined and entrepreneurial hardly the stereotypical image of a student and it is important for peoples perceptions to be brought up to date we have seen first hand how techno savvy and talented these students are and witnessed their commitment to the commercial world
1574988 fender europe has grown significantly over the last 10 years and to support our continued expansion we needed to reassess our business continuity plans having worked with telecitygroup through a third party already we knew they could deliver the highly secure reliable data centre facilities we needed they also have the capacity for us to expand as and when we need to meaning they can meet all our future requirements we put a huge amount of trust into telecitygroup to ensure our equipment is maintained 24 7 and weve been happy with the service they have provided
1574989 famous brands such as fender need to protect their business and increasingly such companies are turning to third parties to help them optimise and maintain critical infrastructure
1574990 in our experience public sector workers are already leading their private sector counterparts in adopting new technologies but there is obvious demand to go a lot further
1574991 why buy from a supermarket when fresh produce from local farmers is cheaper and delivered to your door on the hour
1574992 theres enough technology acumen amongst homegrown companies in this country to make a real difference to the governments ailing it

1575009 the john bull character was that of a drinking man hard headed down to earth averse to intellectualism fond of dogs horses ale and country sports during the napoleonic wars john bull became the national symbol of freedom of loyalty to king and country and of resistance to french aggression he was the ordinary man in the street who would fight napoleon with his bare hands if necessary by the 1800s he was seen as a more assertive figure in domestic politics as well prepared to criticise the royal family and the government giving those outside the traditional political process a voice john bull became so familiar that his name frequently appeared in books plays periodical titles and as a brand name or trademark although frequently used through world war ii john bull has been seen less often since the 1950s as uncle sam is the iconic representation of the united states so john bull is the personification of the character of the english honest generous straightforward with a zest for life and ready to stand up and fight for what he believes in

1575013 theres a lot of people on our team who arent happy with our class choices
1575014 but after weve established diablo iii as its own game with its own type of gameplay and experiences i wouldnt be opposed to looking at old classes we are trying to design the witch doctor class so that if we did bring back the necromancer theres room for him were looking out ahead of time at what our expansions are going to be so weve got to keep room open for some of those other classes down the road
1575015 thats why we think were probably only using 30 or 40 per cent of the power of the ps3 right now and theres this great untapped potential all third party developers can get the edge libraries for free and are going to be able to use them in their own ways to get more and more and more out of the ps3 over the years

1575032 there is a significant possibility that braid would have been the next
1575033 if it were just a matter of my own money i wouldnt care so much but i ran out of money while developing braid and had to borrow a lot so i owe people a lot of money that makes the nature of the decision a little different
1575034 there is a significant possibility that braid would have been the next psychonauts or beyond good and evil critically acclaimed but nobody played it
1575035 if i could ensure my ability to keep making games without publisher interference and release braid at 0 i would do that
1575036 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1575037 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1575038 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1575039 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1575040 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1575041 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs

1575054 we have criminal justice through the school and it was posted up through the school and i thought the kids would have a really good time comin down here

1575292 if mr rudd and other world leaders attending the opening ceremony remain silent the chinese government will interpret this as acceptance of the current situation in tibet
1575293 it appears clear that the government of china has politicised the games to the maximum first by uniting the public through nationalism and on the other hand using the games to crack down on dissenting voices

1575300 we are here to dispel religious ignorance because this is who we are
1575301 i hope everyone at sometime in their career finds a fundamentally held absolute truth to be 100 false only science can do this
1575302 theologians should care about what we have to say about science but scientists dont give a hill of beans about what theologians have to say its just not relevant to the practice of science
1575303 most people dont realize that science can prove nothing to be true only that something is false
1575304 most of the best ideas ive ever had have been wrong its a pity that nature didnt use them
1575305 on a cosmic scale we are totally insignificant all the stars galaxies planets light us everything that can be seen is less than 1 of the universe it is totally insignificant but because of that it informs how unbelievably precious we are at the same time
1575306 most science popularizers take a very serious responsibility to present what we know and dont know and is in most respectable cases only a presentation of the science and largely ignores theological questions
1575307 the habits of mind in science and religion are fundamentally different and the practice of science will tend to erode traditional theism over time sciences habit of mind goes against a herd mentality and cultural trends
1575308 identity oriented manipulation is a major business in our culture wars
1575309 it is ludicrous to be censorious towards teaching kids the scientific rational process and the creation story gives us this tool with children who were raised fundamentally as one of the worlds foremost experts on the age of the earth i have used this approach in religious schools when i have spoken with them i havent been invited back
1575310 education liberates us from the slavery of marginalization and identity
1575311 so the story goes with so much of what passes for serious discussion in this culture immediately presupposing that these polarities not only exist and are interminable but that there is obviously no other option than to be for this and against that
1575312 the reason oil prices are so high the market is betting on an obama win
1575313 if the republican candidate is elected the thinking goes the administration will say this is your baby you handle it but if the democrat is elected theyll say we cant trust him well handle it ourselves

1575320 when we can be with whatever is happening in the moment our sense of completeness will be present our feeling of wholeness of fulfillment will be present as we open to whatevers happening in the moment we dont have to
1575321 when we can surrender into the moment without any attachment anywhere so that anything that arises is seen with a soft non judging mind we experience our completeness we can be with our loneliness or our fear or even our self consciousness in a very complete way we see that those are just passing states of mind and though they may be painful to acknowledge the recognition of their presence is the truth and the truth is beautiful

1575529 any time you have two pitches you can throw for a strike when you need to throw it for a strike and a ball when you need to throw it for a ball it makes it pretty tough on them even if they are see the ball hit the ball kind of guys

1575643 ein konzept wo viel geld flie t ein anderes konzept wo sport und kultur regieren
1575644 wenns ums geld geht haben wir keine chance aber wenn es um die olympische idee geht k nnen wir punkten
1575645 die bieten etwas an was auch interessant ist und durchaus diskussionsw rdig
1575646 n mlich neue weltgegenden zu erschlie en wir haben aber nicht diese finanzielle feuerkraft wir kommen ber die emotionen
1575647 salzburg bietet etwas das man mit geld nicht kaufen kann
1575648 wintersport ist in sterreich ein lebensgef hl es ist teil unserer nationalen dna
1575649 wenn salzburg gewinnt werden die preise f r die fernsehrechte steigen

1575660 dieter hennig wird als privatmann am olympischen fackellauf teilnehmen aber nicht als redaktionsleiter des sid
1575661 mir ist wichtig dass alle anderen 79 sid kollegen die sich um sauberen journalismus bem hen und hervorragende arbeit machen nicht unter dieser diskussion leiden
1575662 wir m ssen in peking differenziert berichten und d rfen uns nicht nur auf den rein sportlichen aspekt beschr nken wir d rfen nicht in so eine hurra falle laufen
1575663 keinen zusammenhang zwischen der berichterstattung des sid und dem fackellauf von dieter hennig gegeben
1575664 das ist f r einen agenturjournalisten der killer das schlimmste nach dem fegefeuer
1575665 der sport informations dienst sid hat mit sofortiger wirkung seinen redaktionsleiter dieter hennig abberufen
1575666 ich finde das gut dass ihr die tour bertragungen abgebrochen habt
1575667 sachlich nur billig und gerecht es ist eine belohnung dass wir vom tour ausstieg profitieren weil nur wenige verb nde so konsequent gegen doping vorgehen wie der dlv
1575668 wir haben das dopingproblem schon vor langer langer zeit thematisiert aufgegriffen und bek mpft wir haben als erste systematische anwendung kluger kontrollen gefordert und wir haben auch den athleten klar gemacht dass es keine verhaltensalternative gibt
1575669 es gibt kein bewusstsein dass wir ein gemeinsames problem haben der sport hat keine verantwortung bernommen wir haben eine chance verpasst
1575670 wollen wir zirkus oder sport wenn wir sport wollen dann ist das zwingend gekoppelt an moral mit welcher berechtigung wollen wir unsere kinder f r leistungssport gewinnen mit welcher berechtigung nehmen wir erzieherische werte in anspruch

1575677 the defense had a good day today yesterday i thought the offense had the upper hand on the defense as typically happens when one side or the other has a good day the other side gets embarrassed a little bit and comes out and practices better the next day
1575678 esto hace que un proyecto que es muy importante en t rminos de necesidad para la regi n deba tener en cuenta todas las consideraciones ambientales al momento de hacer la evaluaci n de la licencia ambiental vamos a hacer reuniones t cnicas para discutir los temas de inter s desde el punto de vista ambiental haremos visita de campo al sitio para verificar en terreno la expedici n de la licencia ambiental podr a demorarse 18 semanas

1575680 you mean weve really been reduced to playing back up for a 15 year old

1575684 no les quepa la menor duda de que si el reglamento de fifa y la federaci n me cobijan voy a llamar a qui n sea del am rica as sea para pasear
1575685 son las estimaciones y todo apunta a que sea en esa direcci n el presupuesto del gobierno es del 5 por ciento pero en consideraci n al efecto que tiene un recorte de inversi n tan importante en la demanda de bienes transables y no transables es perfectamente previsible que podamos tener un menor crecimiento econ mico si todas las variables permanecen iguales

1575689 popular cultural thoughts are always directive to be part of the whole part of the collective the war on the self is meant to cause anguish as you fight the collective which collectively languish theres a few of us left with spirit residual who champion the cause called the true individual
1575690 i bought groceries and then went across the street to watch the little league games

1575693 what would have happened if the chemical assistance available today was available in his day would he still have created the masterpieces that he did or would the world have lost these valuable treasures

1575709 working closely with russian designer oleg cassini jackie created looks that transformed the face of american fashion
1575710 her clothing was a timeless mixture of formality and tasteful low key classics that she always wore with confidence and class making her a trendsetter for her generation and the perfect inspiration for sable amp minxs summer collection
1575711 jackie was a fan of separates of luxurious fabrics in black and white combos single colour schemes modest patterns and a neutral hued palette
1575712 so we also have reflected this with independent pieces in cr me caramel sand black baby pink and pastel lemon
1575713 the enduring nature of the garments is a fitting homage to a woman who was such a political social and cultural force and ideal for anyone wanting to make a statement of streamlined cool grace
1575714 we didnt set out to make an nc 17 film thats just commercial suicide
1575715 they felt it was rather sexually graphic my point is it was comically graphic all the sex in the movie with the exception of one scene is very cartoonish very campy
1575716 i havent heard anything about an upcoming wedding from lindsay but if she was marrying sam i dont think shed ask me to walk her down the aisle
1575717 she knows about my christian faith she just wouldnt ask
1575718 i want her to be happy and healthy and stay on the right path if i discuss her relationship i say that i want her to be happy
1575719 unfortunately i cant make any comment other than to say that as soon as the band has clear future plans they will issue a statement and we hope to be able to do that in the next week or two
1575720 i swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation we must always take sides neutrality helps the oppressor never the victim silence encourages the tormentor never the tormented
1575721 follow your dreams when one door closes another one opens
1575722 just how is my dad going to die and what can i do for him
1575723 this community gay for me is my beloved community this true colors tour is not a money making venture i have been running with this community all my life and when i hear people like george bush talk about the gay community being anti american it makes my blood boil
1575724 the guy who saved the white house one of the heroes who crashed that plane on 9 11 was gay the rugby player mark bingham who died on united 93 and does bush ever mention that does he f k
1575725 isaia is currently at fullback for auckland and has played there previously at the international and the rebel sport super 14 level
1575726 hes also got the ability to play elsewhere in the backline which is helpful when we are a long way from home
1575727 leon is improving but the medical advice is to take things slowly
1575728 hell gradually get back into exercise and then training and then may look to play an air new zealand cup match
1575729 the main theme is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
1575730 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular
1575731 for us people are people you should all have your own opinion we are hopefully putting the human element in what is an unfortunate part of life
1575732 oh you like to be alive and full of phlegm me too
1575733 and then i had to physically restrain myself from choking that man in the middle of the street
1575734 the people got up and looked around and saw the mountain lions tail leaving the house
1575735 a close race down to the wire only one winner thanks i accept
1575736 the reason she got challenged on that was her own doing
1575737 if she had not been out publicly defending his behavior it wouldnt have happened in the first place

1575739 the president of the united states elected this november will listen conscientiously to the majority for whom the top priority is human survival
1575740 even leaders previously central to creating and implementing u s nuclear policy are now repeatedly demanding a world without nuclear weapons
1575741 i join you in commemorating the past and affirm my determination to work with you and all people to achieve a peaceful and secure world without nuclear weapons
1575742 i today here in hiroshima again pledge that our country will firmly maintain the three antinuclear principles and take the lead in international society to realize the abolition of nuclear weapons and lasting peace
1575743 this study should teach us the grave import of the truth born of tragedy and suffering that the only role for nuclear weapons is for them to be abolished
1575744 its important to remember the devastation caused by nuclear weapons
1575745 i dont think basketball should be an olympic sport i dont think tennis should be an olympic sport
1575746 to me the olympics were founded on amateur sport guys go in there and train for four years putting their whole lives on the line to win a gold medal
1575747 if i was running the olympics i would go back to the way it was originally
1575748 gymnastics weightlifting swimming and track and field and marathons thats to me what the olympics is
1575749 it is not about tennis or golf or anything like that
1575750 those are three sports where guys are getting paid a lot of money to play and compete week in and week out it is so professional
1575751 i think having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1575752 and the reason for that is it would bring 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and the revenues that would be going towards the growth of the game of golf
1575753 they olympics would bring us to new markets on a worldwide scale and i cant imagine how big the game can become in countries like china and india
1575754 i think the criticism is that not enough countries play it but i think it is played all around the world and we have so many great players from around the world
1575755 so if it was for our amateur golfers i think it would be great for our professional golfers i am hesitant but i still would like to see golf in the olympics
1575756 the composer writer must produce the work that they want to produce and the listeners readers expectations do not enter into it
1575757 the reader and i collaborate to make this work meaningful if i jerk the reader around thats just power tripping
1575758 we can only hope that the president of the united states elected this november will listen conscientiously to the majority for whom the top priority is human survival
1575759 the voices faces and forms that vanished in the hell
1575760 this study should teach us the grave import of the truth born of tragedy and suffering that the only role for nuclear weapons is to be abolished
1575761 children who evacuated buildings or went to work at factories on that day have not returned 63 years on the atomic bomb deprived them of normal life
1575762 we agreed that our ultimate aim is to achieve the denuclearization of north korea and we agreed that this aim will be achieved by thoroughly verifying the declaration submitted by north korea
1575763 im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs
1575764 the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures
1575765 however its going to require actions on the leader of north koreas part it just doesnt automatically happen
1575766 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist the north korea leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1575767 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1575768 the two presidents urged north korea to promptly complete its commitments in the second phase of the denuclearization process and through third phase actions to implement full abandonment of all its nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs
1575769 reaffirmed their intent to take corresponding measures together with other participating countries in the six party talks and agreed to continue close coordination
1575770 the two presidents reaffirmed that the korea u s free trade agreement will boost trade increase economic growth and create jobs in both the united states and korea while also adding an enduring economic pillar to our two countries bilateral partnership
1575771 toward that end the two presidents committed themselves to working with their respective legislatures to approve the korus fta as soon as possible
1575772 resolved to move forward with developing the alliance into a strategic and future oriented structure to better address changes in the security environment and future needs in the 21st century
1575773 beijing welcomes you i wish for success of the beijing olympic torch relay
1575774 as for the fake breasts thing i dont know how men feel about settling down with a woman who has fake breasts i dont really know how or even if they interfere with breast feeding but i do think that guys love fake boobies on strippers on their girlfriends not so much
1575775 im always saying isnt that a bit much to some of the lingerie so i try on a lot of the lingerie and i veto a lot
1575776 we believe the commercial is exceptional and hits the mark for secret obsession
1575777 both parties agreed that the issue of reinstating the sacked judges could easily be resolved once they succeeded in getting rid of president musharraf
1575778 discussions were held in a very cordial manner and were very positive frank and productive
1575779 major progress was made as broad consensus emerged on key issues
1575780 police now believe the attack was not a random event
1575781 there is no particular threat to public safety from those responsible
1575782 mount rushmore cheekbones the angular jawline the smoothed forehead the plumped skin the heartlike shape of the face
1575783 looking at madonna i kept thinking of the british expression for reconditioning a saddle having it restuffed
1575784 its possible though in some cases before and after pictures would seem to suggest otherwise that this face is occurring entirely naturally after all these are women who are famous for being beautiful
1575785 the point is that there is a noticeable aesthetic shift happening in the face and thats dovetailing with quantum leaps in plastic surgery and dermatology
1575786 i have never represented anyone who has spoken to me about plastic surgery nor have i asked them i dont want to know anyone who has had it done im all for it its great
1575787 while others have linked agent orange to cancers such as soft tissue sarcomas hodgkins disease and lymphoma there is limited evidence so far associating it with prostate cancer
1575788 here we report on the largest study to date of vietnam war veterans exposed to agent orange and the incidence of prostate cancer
1575789 our countrys veterans deserve the best possible health care and this study clearly confirms that agent orange exposure during service in vietnam is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer later in life
1575790 just as those with a family history of prostate cancer or who are of african american heritage are screened more frequently so too should men with agent orange exposure be given priority consideration for all the screening and diagnostic tools we have at our disposal in the hopes of early detection and treatment of this disease
1575791 i think i did that to myself last year in the first half
1575792 i dont think lou ever got over that thats fine i have no ill feelings and i mean that truly
1575793 we needed to get woody on the roster and we needed a spot we couldnt go to 13 pitchers hopefully somebody picks him up and he can go help some team i wish him nothing but the best
1575794 he came in the sixth inning with no problems and then he gave up the 2 runs in the seventh but weve got some choices with howry with marmol with samardzija and gaudin
1575795 reality tv show casting david lee roth impersonators for van halen tribute band
1575796 with the addition of mr murphy ravenell and levitt i now believe i have assembled a team that will have the might and expertise to tell my side of the story
1575797 i am confident that after hearing everything my side will prevail mr murphy comes highly recommended and i am pleased that he has agreed to lead my defence team
1575798 we are confident that when we present all the facts the public for the first time will get a true picture of what actually happened and remy will be vindicated
1575799 we didnt realise wed lost a lot of speed thats always frustrating you think why cant we do what we were able to do a year ago
1575800 sometimes someone can tell you something a hundred times but you hear it from a different voice the same thing and you take it on board and you understand it
1575801 it was pretty valuable having conrad over there and hes done what we are trying to do he was the last kiwi to win a gold in the coxless four so
1575802 we trained very hard in sydney we tried to get back a bit more easy speed as our coach put it so we dont get halfway down the track and were already a bit more worn out than everyone else
1575803 its hard to tell but we had some good stuff yesterday we like to think were on the up at the right time
1575804 the whole squad wants to come together and really push the levels right toward the end and id like to think we are
1575805 were coming in with a bit more confidence but you want to perform well and you want to be right up there and we for how we were rowing how much we were working we werent close enough we werent doing it well enough to be up there
1575806 if there was an easy answer if we knew the little thing that we had lost then we would have worked on it
1575807 its not for lack of trying its not for lack of skill
1575808 some of the other competition has got better australia and america have obviously picked it up but i believe the other crews the dutch the italians and the british havent gone a leap ahead so theyve made small incremental changes and weve come back a little bit
1575809 its a very big surprise in life when you learn that not everyone is rooting for you its a very scary thing when you figure that out
1575810 i never imagined that worrying about what other people think of me would be a big part of my day but when you get that much negativity thrown at you you go whew ive got to cope with that
1575811 nothing i heard in the press resembled the truth what an insight for me
1575812 the newsletter says ereader offers 25 discount but my computation if i remember my math correctly reveals that the price cut is actually around 34 here is the list of old and new prices
1575813 the attraction is clearly the vampire hero who is a perfect entleman eternally faithful and as the author points out repeatedly quite a hunk
1575814 he lay perfectly still in the grass his shirt open over his sculpted incandescent chest his scintillating arms bare a perfect statue carved in some unknown stone smooth like marble glittering like crystal
1575815 before you make fun of this i want you to seriously consider whether youre interested in denigrating people who spend their leisure time actually reading books rather than watching
1575816 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1575817 under the circumstances its hard to talk about what comes next
1575818 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1575819 irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises
1575820 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1575821 if there is a subtle shift in the feds risk assessment it is that while acknowledging the downside risks to growth it notes the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1575822 this may have been a sufficient bone to the hawks to prevent others from joining fisher in dissenting
1575823 we will continue our efforts to tell the international community of our sovereign rights regarding this dokdo issue
1575824 so we will be very consistent and continuously let people know this is a sovereign land belonging to south korea
1575825 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1575826 unless something really weird happens i dont see the fed moving before the november election
1575827 the fed doesnt like to be in the spotlight during the heat of a presidential campaign
1575828 i think they will prefer waiting now until they can get a better view of how the economy is unfolding and see if financial markets become less fragile
1575829 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1575830 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place
1575831 we have an indisputable international law obligation that conflicts with state law
1575832 the supreme court has ruled the president has neither the constitutional power nor the legislative authority to overturn the state rules
1575833 its silence is no surprise the united states has not wavered in its position that petitioner was not prejudiced by his lack of consular access
1575834 even president bush who signed scores of death warrants as texas governor concurred some time ago that the united states must honor its international obligations in this case
1575835 there will be no clearer sign that texas will have gone beyond the pale than if jose medellins execution goes forward
1575836 baseball goes out the window a lot of guys were probably trying to take their neck chains off good thing we play with wood and not aluminum that thing would have been called a long time ago
1575837 youre on the field and you hear it getting closer and closer and its lighting up the sky
1575838 the fans who stayed hats off the them theyre crazier than i would be a lot of people were trapped and couldnt leave
1575839 youve been through storms ive never seen anything like the lightning like that that bad and that close you could see it actually getting closer as youre on the field youre like weve got about five minutes here this thing is going to be right on top of us that lightning bolt hit its scary but you look back on it we watched the replay and laughed at the reaction of some of the players
1575840 i sat out there for a while and watched it it was unfortunate we werent able to finish the game but it was pretty entertaining
1575841 we were usually off the field pretty quickly if its lightning
1575842 as loud and as bright as some of the lightning was originally he was given assurances that it was not close i dont think anyone who was on top of it felt anything was real close until the last jolt then it was definitely time to shut er down

1575844 yes doctor weak legs vertigo head aches and my back hurts
1575845 things have to get worse for the aussie to continue selling off
1575846 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1575847 i was egg shell walking where i could only put light pressure on the ground
1575848 there was no pain whatsoever and within two weeks i felt good
1575849 it paves the way for exciting new research for stem cell therapy we can do in australia
1575850 the parliamentary liberal party has elected colin barnett as its leader
1575851 the election was for one nomination only and was unopposed
1575852 no doubt ill be a bit rusty because i havent played for a year
1575853 but im confident ive put all the hard work in so its just another game for me
1575854 it doesnt mean a thing its my first game of the season
1575855 im just going to go out there and play my normal game im not really thinking too much about it im just treating it like every game ive played
1575856 hes been probably our best player all year if i can go out there and play like lance ill be happy

1575860 i would have thought mr ngo should be the first witness
1575861 ill direct that steps be taken to bring him to sydney
1575862 this was our worst effort i wouldnt say effort this is our worst performance
1575863 i dont think we were as sharp as we have been i dont think we played very well or not up to what we can play
1575864 we are not happy at all with the way we played i think we could have done much better
1575865 we are going to play much better defense i think you have to give some credit to the australian team because they executed very well
1575866 we broke down on defense and let the other team get open looks
1575867 we cant have mental breakdowns like those because these teams are tough and really know how to shoot the ball
1575868 the last two games the ball has been sticking a little bit so we have to get back to looking like the first games where everybody was touching the ball and we were playing like we should
1575869 weve won four games here and now its a matter of winning eight games in a row
1575870 the energy required to crush concrete to 100 m particles is 1 9 1011 j which is well within the crushing capacity of the available energy hence it is theoretically possible for the wtc collapse events to have crushed more than 90 of the floor concrete to particles well within the observed particle size range
1575871 it is clear from the computer studies that the heat from the fires caused differential expansion of the steel parts in the long span floor trusses with the resulting thermal bowing in some floors directly exerting pull in forces on the exterior columns or this thermal bowing could have detached a floor which would have impacted the floor below destroying composite action by separating the concrete slab from the trusses and inducing strong tensile suspension forces in the double weighted floor in other floors thermal expansion of the floor against the columns compressed the trusses which along with shear forces within the trusses that buckled the diagonal struts collapsing the trusses which went into suspension catenary action and this also helped pull in and eventually buckle the exterior column walls
1575872 it was as if someone were sitting at an invisible panel pushing buttons to set off bombs
1575873 never sharpens into full focus like an unfinished sculpture in which you can recognize the subject is human but beyond this taken at different points of view it could be a representation of virtually anyone
1575874 we avoid speaking of stories as stories for the same reason we avoid contemplating the inevitability of death it can be unpleasant it can hurt
1575875 we agreed that our ultimate aim is to achieve the denuclearization of north korea and we agreed that this aim will be achieved by thoroughly verifying the declaration submitted by north korea
1575876 im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs
1575877 the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures
1575878 however its going to require actions on the leader of north koreas part it just wont automatically happen
1575879 the two presidents urged north korea to promptly complete its commitments in the second phase of the denuclearization process and through third phase actions to implement full abandonment of all its nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs
1575880 reaffirmed their intent to take corresponding measures together with other participating countries in the six party talks and agreed to continue close coordination
1575881 the two presidents reaffirmed that the korea u s free trade agreement will boost trade increase economic growth and create jobs in both the united states and korea while also adding an enduring economic pillar to our two countries bilateral partnership
1575882 toward that end the two presidents committed themselves to working with their respective legislatures to approve the korus fta as soon as possible
1575883 resolved to move forward with developing the alliance into a strategic and future oriented structure to better address changes in the security environment and future needs in the 21st century
1575884 woe to you oh earth and sea for the devil sends the beast with wrath because he knows the time is short let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast for it is a human number its number is six hundred and sixty six
1575885 this is a significant relief for gas users as well as the economy of western australia mr carpenter said
1575886 the worst of the situation is clearly over we still have a long way to go
1575887 we have constant conversations with all our customers and try to meet their needs as best we can
1575888 restrict supply to genuine cases of treatment of short term pain
1575889 the adverse side effects and problems happen over a long period of time not usually in short treatment bursts so limiting pack sizes would be the way to go
1575890 and we look forward to having the issue investigated further to understand the situation more thoroughly
1575891 the psa is not aware of any published evidence of widespread misuse apart from newspaper articles based on anecdotal reports
1575892 in india even god cannot help he will be a silent spectator as he will also feel helpless
1575893 in our view the stand of the centre and the states is condemnable in view of the galloping trend of unauthorised occupation of official accommodation which neither the centre nor the states are in a position to contain
1575894 the whole government machinery is corrupt we may lay down the law but who will implement it it has to be done by the clerks the secretaries and joint secretaries have no guts to go against the clerks the law is there the statute is there but the governments have become non functional
1575895 ache sua cartela de vacina o de 30 anos atr s

1575898 a raquel deve estar pensando maldita hora em que eu conheci essa louca
1575899 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place
1575900 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds to the extent that people arent able to do that people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake
1575901 and of course behind those people there were those who were sort of opposed
1575902 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
1575903 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1575904 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1575905 it was the biggest struggle ever in burmese history not just in one town but even in remote villages the whole country was marching in the streets
1575906 twenty years afterward well you know we wont see that kind of demonstration happen again in the near future
1575907 and if it happens we know that as long as this government is in power they will crack down
1575908 isolation has pushed the burmese military toward authoritarian regimes instead of democracies
1575909 so its time for the west to think about these issues in perspective and try to engage the military
1575910 the most important development of the last 20 years is not so much suppression of the democratic movement but the opening up to china
1575911 i think the life of the ordinary burmese people in 10 or 20 years from now will depend much more on how that relationship evolves than almost anything else
1575912 pre pma 2008 memory maker atp has launched what it describes as
1575913 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1575914 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1575915 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1575916 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1575917 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1575918 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1575919 we want people in the community to know were approachable hopefully tonight build some relationships or start to and for those already started strengthen that bond and let the community know we want to work together with them to make lompoc a safer better place to be

1575924 a good way to work around this is to locally cache results for 24 hours youll find for most apps the number of unique queries you need to make is well under 5k

1575929 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1575930 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1575931 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1575932 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1575933 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
1575934 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1575935 at a typical hospital this can take six months or longer to work through this process and get recothrom on the pharmacy shelf
1575936 weve learned during our time on the market that in many cases the process can become longer through postponement of meetings getting bumped from agendas or lack of decisions or clear follow up actions weve also found that it can take several months after a positive committee decision for regular purchasing to begin
1575937 not unsurprisingly the time frame of investors is rather short
1575938 we are interested in building a company that is going to be of great value to investors and investors are interested in what is going to happen in three months
1575939 our system today is wholly unreliable businesses and passengers cant depend on airline schedules
1575940 to me it is scary to buy food that you dont know how or where it was grown
1575941 this rule potentially will have an impact on all participants in the supply chain
1575942 the greatest impact will be on retailers and intermediaries handlers processors wholesalers and importers while the impact on individual producers is likely to be relatively small
1575943 bottega veneta epitomizes the character of the bravern in its commitment to fashion design extraordinary craftsmanship and personal service
1575944 we will be covering several vast areas of what is basically wilderness and then there are the flights over water
1575945 we want our support team to know exactly where we are and what sort of progress we are making
1575946 this is an exciting adventure because it is a mix of endurance for both man and machine taking place on a global stage and we feel privileged to have been chosen to be a part of it
1575947 we have now been involved in several expeditions where people have pushed themselves to the limit in difficult conditions and this one will be no different in terms of what we want to deliver in the way of providing a world class tracking system
1575948 its important for yahoos board to understand there is still pressure on them
1575949 i thought yahoos board was kind of let off the hook last week when they didnt really deserve to be
1575950 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant

1575956 well in for a penny in for a pound i suppose carry on with the central planning
1575957 of course some would argue that foo but this does not take into account the bar therefore i am obviously and unassailably correct
1575958 im always slightly anxious at first with movie stars because they can either make your life a dream or a living hell
1575959 sometimes you get an actor who is majorly neurotic or powerful and controlling and its horrible billy crystal really wanted to be directing the movie
1575960 if youre hired as a director and someone says youre not really gonna be the director youre there to hold billys hand and really hes gonna direct it then thats fine but to not be told that and then to go in its an all out war and its not pleasant
1575961 im allergic to things like horses and cats when i made

1575981 is so staggeringly bad at achieving its purported aims that it doesnt make sense
1575982 when understood this way as i mentioned in an earlier post when i first saw this video i just found it confusing but now it makes complete sense
1575983 tudo pode ser s basta acreditar tudo que tiver que ser ser
1575984 to ye who finds my treasure i bestow upon you all my worldly goods

1575991 then we can look to consider whether in the psychiatrists opinion the accused is fit to stand trial and whether we are proceeding at that point or whether there are fitness concerns that need to be canvassed by the court
1575992 my last two starts ive pitched terrible ive let us down

1575996 this person back in your jail is now a person of interest in our investigation of that case
1575997 one of the things we are going to try to determine is is he chichester
1575998 those people would inadvertently give false information to cover his tracks
1575999 we dont even know if he is a citizen of the united states
1576000 i was actually thrilled because i thought well good maybe theyve got some kind of lead and it would be nice to find out what the mystery is after all these years
1576001 we were never able to pin anything down on him never were really able to figure out where he came from what he had done he was one of these people that kind of appeared and then disappeared and no one seemed to know anything about him
1576002 she always believed he was alive and she didnt understand why he didnt write

1576020 i think fort washington is too congested as it is with all the schools there i am very concerned for the safety of school children going to school and their ability to meet response time in a school zone
1576021 we are in a position of having to prove the commissioners wrong rather than have the commissioners listen to reasonable input from the community
1576022 we have raised a number of questions about the methodology used to determine the site and we have not received responses i dont think a fire station belongs in a school zone with student drivers on a very narrow and busy road
1576023 we will continue to insist the township do the necessary research weigh all of the factors and consider community input before putting shovel in the ground some of commissioners have listened to the community but many have not
1576024 the more we looked into it we found that communities that have fire stations near schools have not had any problems with it in the last 10 years nationally there have not been any records of accidents with a firetruck in a school zone
1576025 i have heard people objecting to the location who keep mentioning things that the studies have disproven i will not just count how many people are for or against the issue in the community i will vote based on convincing arguments
1576026 the radio channels and the internet has really helped the film to become extremely popular among youngsters
1576027 the trailers of psycho have also become a big hit and i think it had more than 35 000 visitors we have sent e mails to various people interested in kannada films and they have uploaded promos and songs on youtube and orkut
1576028 though we have not released the songs video cds to the channels or youtube the songs broadcast on radio channels and the internet have really helped the film to get wide publicity
1576029 we had given promotional trailers to various television channels and kannada film websites who uploaded it on youtube this has helped my film

1576084 everyone is so rushed i dont think the doctors are bad people they are just working in a broken system
1576085 doctors used to be the only source for information on medical problems and what to do but now our knowledge is demystified
1576086 when patients come in with preconceived ideas about what we should do they do get perturbed at us for not listening i do my best to explain why i do what i do but some people are not satisfied until we do what they want
1576087 by the time youre done with your training you feel in many ways that you are as far as you could possibly be from the very people youve set out to help
1576088 patients are interested in being tended to and being listened to and being well
1576089 it adds misery and suffering to any condition to not have a source of care that you trust
1576090 all of us the patients and the doctors ultimately want the same thing
1576091 but we see ourselves on opposite sides of a divide there is this sense that were facing off with each other and were not working together its a tragedy
1576092 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
1576093 dan aku berkata ayo kerja bareng dan menulis sesuatu ayo masuk ke studio dan bersenang senang
1576094 saya sangat terinspirasi perempuan indonesia masa kini terutama yang ada di papua mereka bisa berkarir dengan sukses ada yang menjadi pejabat pengusaha dan banyak lagi profesi strategis yang bisa dilakukan oleh perempuan
1576095 saya masih belum percaya diri merancang busana untuk orang lain karena sebelum merancang baju untuk seseorang saya merasa lebih pas kalau melihat bagaimana kepribadiannya dulu

1576099 keadaannya sekarang sudah dah agak mendingan sudah ada respon dari mama mata bisa melihat yang kanan belum ada gerakan
1576100 ya kalau putus mungkin sudah faktor alam kali ya seperti seleksi alam kita cocok apa nggak dan mungkin karena kita sama sama tidak mengerti aja mungkin karena masih mempertahankan ego masing masing
1576101 memang sih awalnya kita kagok banget untuk berhubungan lagi jadi kaku banget tapi sekarang komunikasi kita sudah membaik lagi
1576102 nggaklah orangtua aku enggak pernah memaksa aku untuk segera menikah
1576103 di sini kita mencari talenta yang berbakat untuk menjadi selebriti baru di indonesia kita akan mencari perempuan perempuan dengan multi talenta dalam bidang akting presenting dan modeling

1576105 apa pun yang ditutup tutupi pasti bakal tahu semua saya harus kasih tahu karena mereka memberikan kasih sayang dan saya nggak mau menyakiti mereka
1576106 mudah mudahan setelah berita ini disiarkan tidak ada ganjalan di hati saya
1576107 padahal mereka tidak berhak mendapatkan itu semua mereka telah mengorbankan perasaan untuk saya seharusnya mereka mendapat penghargaan
1576108 sekarang gue sendiri jadi lebih mengekspresikan diri sendiri kalau dulu banyak kepala
1576109 sudah beberapa kali mencoba tapi ndak bisa makanya bisa dibilang saya mulai dari nol lagi apalagi banyak band band sekarang yang bagus bagus dan saya pinginnya menjadi bagian terbaik di antara mereka
1576110 ya pastinya aku grogi banget dan saya sangat pesimis mendapatkan peranan itu
1576111 kalau masalah aku nggak hapal al fatihah karena aku memang tinggal di luar negeri dan tadi aku juga grogi banget beneran enggak pernah aku audisi kayak begini banget groginya

1576114 memang benar saya berpoligami istri saya dua yang pertama memiliki enam anak kemudian saya menikah lagi tiga tahun yang lalu dan sekarang sudah punya satu putri
1576115 ini impact dari satu perasaan yang diberikan tuhan kepada saya yang tidak pernah bisa distop oleh manusia ya seperti yang saya alami
1576116 istri yang pertama dan kedua sudah saling mengetahui syukur pengertian mereka sangat luar biasa tulus dan mereka menghormati saya tugas saya hanya untuk menjaga mereka dan saya bertangungjawab untuk berbuat adil

1576120 however the main impact on the market is in the volume of transactions which have been more than halved over the year
1576121 while a correction in the market is taking place it is important to stress that price levels have not collapsed and the marking down of prices appears to be incremental rather than a one off correction
1576122 for instance there are different factors affecting both the resale and the new build markets
1576123 with a very quiet resale market i believe there is a high probability of the average price dropping closer to the 200 000 level before the end of year with a period of adjustment stretching into 2009
1576124 anyone looking for the green shoots of recovery should keep an eye on transaction levels which are likely to turn before prices do but it might be a while
1576125 the current situation provides government with an opportunity to accelerate the building of social and affordable homes
1576126 the thing i like about this club you are going to have nights where you dont play well but from one night to the next you cant tell what went on by the attitude in the dugout
1576127 lannan was pitching as good a game as ive seen for seven innings except that one pitch it enabled us to capture some momentum
1576128 before the game i said we need a minimum five innings from a starter and a chance to win a game
1576129 thats the biggest home run ive hit this year based off the situation
1576130 and the question is whether that is fatigue if it doesnt get straightened out that is something we have to consider
1576131 we dont make excuses baseball players travel sometimes the team that has been traveling wins games
1576132 yo i failed ninth grade three times but i dont think it was necessarily cause im stupid
1576133 un jour son p re est venu me dire quarman aimait bien mes chansons et ma demand si je voulais bien venir laider cest ce que jai fait et on a travaill sur une maquette de 4 chansons
1576134 on sest dit que c tait loccasion de montrer comme arman chantait cest l que jai propos quil interpr te la chanson des jo que javais compos e en d cembre dernier juste pour la d monstration
1576135 cest un morceau auquel je tenais vraiment les parents nont pas respect ma demande le probl me cest quils veulent utiliser les jo comme tremplin pour faire de leur enfant une vedette ce nest vraiment pas de la jalousie de ma part mais personne ne ma demand mon autorisation
1576136 under the circumstances its hard to talk about what comes next
1576137 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1576138 irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises
1576139 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1576140 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1576141 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1576142 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1576143 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1576144 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1576145 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1576146 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1576147 i just know we were out at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter
1576148 the board will keep an open mind of course for an offer of the whole company that reflects fair value
1576149 to gain a recommendation from the board and the right to conduct due diligence any proposal must recognize the value of our unique set of assets and must contain a sufficient control premium and this proposal did not reach the mark
1576150 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1576151 unless something really weird happens i dont see the fed moving before the november election
1576152 if we dont get a strong number oil prices will likely fall further
1576153 elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1576154 i expect prices to fall to between 100 and 110 by the end of the year
1576155 a close race down to the wire only one winner thanks i accept
1576156 the reason she got challenged on that was her own doing
1576157 if she had not been out publicly defending his behavior it wouldnt have happened in the first place
1576158 raise whatever he needs for his defense as any mother in this room would do
1576159 we have not had any contact with them because their phones are off
1576160 at this moment the tibetans inside tibet are brutally and violently being crushed by chinese authorities
1576161 its absolutely critical that a message is sent to the chinese government to meaningfully address and end violence and repression in tibet or they will never be truly accepted by the international community
1576162 quatre trangers se sont rassembl s ill galement nous condamnons vigoureusement cette action

1576165 la principale menace visant les jo ne vient pas da mais de letim
1576166 letim a lintention de perp trer des attaques en dehors du xinjiang en particulier p kin

1576170 quelle que soit la propagande quutiliserait p kin il ne faut pas sous estimer la capacit de letim frapper la chine
1576171 les chinois ont r alis des efforts exceptionnels pour r duire les menaces autour des jeux
1576172 ces efforts entraveront la capacit de nimporte quel groupe de planifier et de commettre un acte autrement qu une petite chelle
1576173 vu la couverture m diatique extr me une attaque dampleur restreinte peut avoir un impact disproportionn
1576174 letim na jamais prouv quil tait capable dop rer en chine en dehors de la province du xinjiang
1576175 the shortlist included historical figures princes singers and sportsmen all of whom we as a nation are immensely proud
1576176 but it is fitting that ray who was perhaps one of the proudest welshmen or certainly the one who displayed his love for his country the most has been named as the nations favourite welsh person
1576177 the evidence indicates that illegal immigrants respond to changing incentives and that many would return home on their own if they felt enforcement was a real possibility
1576178 the illegal immigrant population has a trivial effect given the fact that they make so much less about 1 5 percent of the total economic output
1576179 if you buy juice for your baby check how much sugar it has in it
1576180 if you cook eggs use the white and throw away the yolk and if you cant get to a gym walk for half an hour each day
1576181 i am really trying hard i bake chicken instead of frying it now
1576182 i want to lose weight and i want my kids to be healthy
1576183 there are so many factors and some of them are hard to change
1576184 our families have a lot of stress they live in dangerous neighborhoods with no place to walk their kids get no exercise in school they come here thinking everything in america must be good for them whether it is fast food or infant formula they dont realize the damage all this is doing
1576185 it all starts with our grandparents we are taught to fill our stomachs but not to eat the right food
1576186 latino families tend to think that a fat child is healthy and a thin one is not it is a big problem
1576187 when you spend all day vacuuming offices or cleaning bathrooms you think you are getting exercise but all you are doing is hurting your back
1576188 often both parents work late and it is so much easier to go to popeyes or buy frozen pizza for the kids
1576189 this is the first time i have ever exercised in my life i come here straight from work and my shoulder always hurts from vacuuming
1576190 in the first 10 years after immigrating people gain an average of 12 pounds
1576191 they arrive blind to american culture and with little knowledge about health care they work around the clock and neglect themselves they live a sedentary life and eat food that is too rich i tell them to go back to what they ate at home rice and lentils and fruits to recover what they have lost
1576192 to create a sense of community rather than racial despair and ethnic conflict
1576193 no i want to see exactly what all the implications what all the cost and i know that there are other groups that are talking about other streets too
1576194 so all those groups deserve to have their voices heard too
1576195 those who feel differently will feel the force of the latino community on this issue because we believe that this is very important and we have chosen the street that would be most appropriate
1576196 i believed there was a need for a newspaper that really deals with important international and local news
1576197 i have seen other publications in spanish but i believed there was a special need for readers and for advertisers
1576198 you have those who want to learn some english and you have others who are attracted only to spanish words
1576199 we have been told that the presidents visit to china has been cancelled
1576200 it did seem a bit strange to me but i just have this rule that no one goes near another vessel
1576201 today marks the opportunity to let the world and this city know that blacks browns and whites can actually come together and dialogue to get things done
1576202 when we look at 66 percent of the citizens in dallas being african americans and hispanics and that over 90 percent of our school district is african american and hispanic we have more in common that unite us than issues that divide us
1576203 we realize the trends of the way things are going i believe we can do things better together we are the majority
1576204 if we can have the passion to develop the w hotel and victory park deep ellum and uptown wheres our passion to develop fair park and oak cliff
1576205 were showing that both ethnic groups can actually come together its a progressive as well as an aggressive attempt
1576206 about 60 to 65 percent of blacks and hispanics still live in apartments therefore we cannot create wealth
1576207 you see gentrification occurring where you had traditional affordable housing for hispanics and african americans
1576208 there are a lot of persons who want to see their cities counties and countries succeed
1576209 where are the city structures named after african americans and hispanics
1576210 we know their whites history but they dont know ours
1576211 viable and have the competency to repay loans but in many cases these banks will not loan them the money
1576212 we want to demystify the illusion that blacks and hispanics dont want to work together he said
1576213 we want to meet with corporate america and develop a master plan
1576214 in addition to the two projects we have plans with desperado for a couple of original graphic novels bring the sold out requiem for the world graphic novel from image comics back in print a special project featuring original deadworld artist vincent locke and were looking at a way of presenting the original deadworld series which has been out of print for over a decade
1576215 deadworld has always been more about the people and how they interact rather than a simple zombie chase and this story allows me to use my science background reed teaches college biology to explore things in this direction but i always thought it should have a certain art style and when sami was available i knew the time was right
1576216 when joe pruett desperado publishing asked me if i was interested to do a deadworld story arc i was like yes very interested i have been a big fan of romeros zombie movies a long long time and soon as i started to really study realistic illustration style it was always like some day i m going to do a comic that includes the dead walking all i did was drawing zombies for couple of years and then some more so for me this is one dream come true my approach for the illustration style will be darker when compared to blue my last comic project this is a post apocalyptic world with nearly no hope in sight so it just has to be the script gary has written is a challenging and yet fun to draw there is a lot cool stuff to do gas masks laboratories piles of bodies and of course the zombies
1576217 to filter funds from controversial or unpopular groups to other pacs and candidates for the purpose of hiding the actual source of a candidates campaign campaign money from voters
1576218 even if it seems as though chinas economic demand run has slowed some those changes at the margins still make them a huge consumer of crude products
1576219 elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1576220 anytime you get that kind of violent price action in a short amount of time it reeks of someone big being in trouble
1576221 throwing sarfate waters and olson against the angels is like taking a poodle to michael vicks house
1576222 the poodle is tearing up the pit bull right now
1576223 so numbed have i become by the endless replay of the fatuous clerical rantings of the rev jeremiah wright that it has taken me this long to remember the significant antecedent in 1995 there appeared a documentary titled
1576224 if we dealt with him like a nation deals with a traitor what the hell business is it of yours
1576225 the philly speech about race wright and obamas racist grandmother was a failure on every level and if it was a failure on every level and thus left obama hideously vulnerable to the very next speech made by his foaming pastor then
1576226 all right then how is it that the loathsome wright married him baptized his children and received donations from him could it possibly have anything i wonder to do with mrs obama
1576227 if there is a reason why the potential nominee has been keeping what he himself now admits to be very bad company and if the rest of his character seems to make this improbable then either

1576238 unnecessary and rude behavior intended to be offensive and cause emotional distress including workplace bullying

1576242 i am obliged to help poor students however assistance i and my company have to offer is limited in scale i hope that the whole society will pay sufficient attention to the issue and reach out to help those poor students as long as everybody is entitled to standard education the public can live and work in peace and contentment therefore blessing the country with lasting peace and stability as well as prosperity
1576243 if we could get everyone on line as quickly as possible the property tax cuts to pennsylvanians would start to be substantial something they can really appreciate
1576244 i really do stay assiduously away from the dealings and the procedures of the gaming commission its my anti indictment strategy
1576245 with the economy the way it is and gas prices people are going to stay close to home and we have a good population around us
1576246 any casino thats showing year over year revenue gains in this economy ought to be happy
1576247 if you look on the east coast pennsylvania is doing very well most markets are reporting year over year declines in gross gaming revenue within the gaming industry right now pennsylvanias a good story
1576248 you definitely are seeing casinos impacted by the economy theres no doubt about that but its not universal in terms of the effects
1576249 some of the markets that rely on more of a drive in business have not decreased revenues
1576250 and pennsylvania gaming and slots at tracks are still relatively new concepts there you still might be getting people who are potentially going for the first time
1576251 we believe the state is very committed to the direction we are taking
1576252 he had ambitions and he worked very hard to get through college he was just a very well liked kid who had a lot of charm and possibilities
1576253 we need to find out all the responsible parties hopefully not only will we find justice for this family that has suffered these horrible losses but also make sure steps are taken to make sure this doesnt happen to somebody else
1576254 he was well respected by his peers but even more so by the folks that lived out here
1576255 shall the county enact an ordinance to increase real estate taxes in order to repeal the alcoholic drink tax
1576256 i doubt there will be any lack of people willing to challenge this
1576257 when the chips need to be put on the table people would rethink the wisdom of filing long shot legal claims that are likely to anger the voters
1576258 even though all those indicted in bonusgate were democrats three quarters say both parties are responsible for corruption in the state legislature
1576259 three quarters say the legislature probably doesnt have the ability to pass the laws needed to fix itself but they want the governor to call a special session to tackle corruption in the capitol
1576260 nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill
1576261 a true leader does not unnecessarily put his troops directly in harms way for purely political gain
1576262 leadership demands the courage to sacrifice for the common good
1576263 he needs to put the public interest ahead of his career interests we are here because we seek to serve not because we seek to advance our careers
1576264 we have tried to keep a positive message in our campaign we havent been slinging mud
1576265 but its difficult when a story like bonusgate hits the front page day after day it turns people off to know that our government is that corrupt
1576266 demonstrate the type of leadership that mr deweese hasnt shown throughout this crisis
1576267 is a further indication that others strongly believe that change at the top is a necessary step forward to begin repairing the breach in the publics trust
1576268 clearly we need to do a better job of educating voters about the dozens of meaningful legislative and administrative reforms that we implemented this session
1576269 it felt like a huge rock a really powerful rock had been thrown up with great velocity
1576270 i just wanted him to get it out of me
1576271 i was imagining all the possibilities that could have happened
1576272 it could have hit my head hit my baby hit my friend in the spine and she couldve crashed it couldve hit the gas tank
1576273 i just was freaking out everyone at the hospital was very kind just wonderful and helped to calm me down
1576274 the baby was very ticked off at all the poking and started kicking and punching me
1576275 it looks like i got poked with something and it took a chunk out of me i got three or four stitches
1576276 you almost killed two people i want them to be more careful to not do that anymore
1576277 i want to know what happened what was the particular incident that caused my sons death
1576278 reared back and punched him in the head with all his might

1576290 a couple of generations ago every grammar school teacher drilled into her charges heads the eternal rule that one forms the future tense in the first person by using the auxiliary verb shall

1576292 oh this should be an interesting and sociologically relevant look at the social situation of middle class suburban america
1576293 one glaring statistic they the media ignored was that approxiamately 60 percent of all births in new orleans were out of wedlock
1576294 given the increased volatility in the financial services market our clients are placing an increasingly high priority on understanding and managing risk across their portfolios
1576295 revenue in this particular segment is not only difficult to predict because it can be lumpy based on the rate of revenue booking under a r amp d contract but it is also a very small portion of the total companys revenue
1576296 as the overall economy continues to slowdown that is flowing through some of their portfolio companies specifically the ones that are more cyclical in nature
1576297 at the end of the day the best way for management to earn back their credibility is through performance
1576298 how the company performs through the down cycle will be the ultimate confirmation
1576299 with continuing economic weakness in the national economy our northern florida real estate markets face difficult conditions

1576322 tibetans have always believed there is a time and place for silence the 2008 beijing olympics is not one of them
1576323 if mr rudd and other world leaders attending the opening ceremony remain silent the chinese government will interpret this as acceptance of the current situation in tibet
1576324 it appears clear that the government of china has politicised the games to the maximum first by uniting the public through nationalism and on the other hand using the games to crack down on dissenting voices
1576325 they rounded up 8 000 falun gong practitioners prior to the games and a number of tibetan locals and dissenting intellectuals

1576367 quench a burning desire to know the real peru to unearth the mystery of the dances
1576368 weve lost the sense of village and family in our cities living often isolated lives weve lost our rituals and seasons our music and dances soy andina touches a deep yearning for that sense of belonging
1576369 there are few works that reflect what someone of our generation goes through in search of identity this is one of them a great documentary
1576370 what a wonderful gift to the world projects like soy andina reach deep into the wellspring of indigenous culture that dissolves boundaries and connects us all
1576371 a film about the miracle of intercultural integration in a globalized age
1576372 the film is beautiful as are the stars they are so articulate honest and joyful the joy of celebrating in peru is something basic and raw and delightful that we dont often see in the us
1576373 until now peruvians did not have a document of their american journey it is a pioneering effort
1576374 esta pel cula muestra de una forma positiva y realista la necesidad de identificaci n cultural que tenemos los inmigrantes y los hijos de inmigrantes y ademas como la diversidad cultural y racial de nosotros los peruanos se expresa en nuestras comunidades en eeuu a pesar de la distancia que nos separa de nuestro pa s de origen
1576375 i came upon this great video by chance seeing the clips filled my heart with longing and memories of people demonstrating their sentiments through their dances and music bravo
1576376 soy andina has all those elements that make a film unforgettable it makes the connection in space and time the present and the past
1576377 the dancers look ecstatic totally in the moment and in their bodies beautiful
1576378 as an academic with years of experience using documentaries on latin america i can honestly say that none ive seen show the intimacy between the camera and the culture that soy andina does it looks at the culture and people from within
1576379 a powerful film of interest to anyone wishing to explore cultures traditions and roots for anyone whos ever asked who am i and where do i belong
1576380 the clips look awesome you captured the essence of the dance the reality of the people
1576381 you seem to have redefined the meaning of dancing taking it far beyond conventional and fashionable terms
1576382 there were more than 300 people at the soy andina fundraiser their enthusiastic response left no doubt that the filmmaker knows his audience
1576383 soy peruano y ver que uds estan tratando de difundir nuestra cultura tan rica pero al igual escondida me alegra mucho es hora que los peruanos seamos orgullosos de nosotros mismos y herencia y que la compartamos con todos los demas
1576384 we would be happy to offer soy andina for distribution this project will be of great interest to scholars and researchers
1576385 somebody should give you money or something for all this
1576386 as hudson institute economist irwin stelzer noted in his london daily telegraph column moses made the waters recede but he had help obama apparently works alone
1576387 a vote for senator obama is a vote for the man we think will make the best president not for a new messiah as christians we have one lord and savior jesus christ it is blasphemous to suggest otherwise and it is beyond offensive to suggest that senator obama is a false messiah or the anti christ himself how low can we go it shows the mccain campaign is willing to make a mockery of our faith to feed peoples fears
1576388 there are numerous parts of this ad that make no sense in a high budget presidential ad unless they are understood for what they really are attempts to convince people that obama may be the anti christ
1576389 we should expect people to be good enough to lift themselves up by their bootstraps but the problem is that some folks dont even have boots and when that happens we should expect america to be better than that too
1576390 this is the moment as nancy pelosi noted that the world is waiting for the 200 000 souls who thronged to his speech in berlin came not just for him he told the enthralled audience of congressional representatives i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions he said according to the source
1576391 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
1576392 i have become a symbol of america returning to our best traditions
1576393 is this trip partly aimed at overcoming that concern that you know there are doubts among some americans that you could lead the country at war as commander in chief from day one
1576394 you know the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those thoughts
1576395 there are doubts among some americans that you could lead the country at war as commander in chief from day one
1576396 i take away the compelling idea that theres serious evil in the world and hardship and pain and we should be humble and modest in our belief that we can eliminate these things but we shouldnt use that as an excuse for cynicism and inaction i take away the sense that we have to make these efforts knowing they are hard and not swinging from naive idealism to bitter realism
1576397 for if the united states should perish the ruthlessness of the foe would be only the secondary cause of the disaster the primary cause would be that the strength of a giant nation was directed by eyes too blind to see all the hazards of the struggle and the blindness would be induced not by some accident of nature or history but by hatred and vainglory
1576398 there is in short even in a conflict with a foe with whom we have little in common the possibility and necessity of living in a dimension of meaning in which the urgencies of the struggle are subordinated to a sense of awe before the vastness of the historical drama in which we are jointly involved to a sense of modesty about the virtue wisdom and power available to us for the resolution of its perplexities

1576461 the idea of microsoft free personal computing has been in the air for a while
1576462 were just partnering with linux distribution vendors and hardware vendors to make it happen
1576463 our role is more on evangelizing and providing the necessary software for corporate needs
1576464 i think the need for alternatives to the microsoft dominated personal computing environment are there
1576465 were viewing this as an alternative to the microsoft small business server group of products
1576466 rather than talk about virtualization technology for an appliance were talking about something that is simple and has a small footprint
1576467 a lot of it shops lack the experience to quickly deploy a linux based cluster
1576468 by making this software stack available were trying to make cluster deployment faster
1576469 one of the new features is that it allows you to build custom servers
1576470 so users will only have the components that are necessary for running their particular application and this adds tremendously to the agility and flexibility of the system
1576471 there are also additional server monitoring tools included and overall deployment and system management has been streamlined
1576472 these were two hard losses games we had a chance to win
1576473 you cant panic but you have to take it with a sense of urgency
1576474 we havent held opponents below five runs in many of those games we havent come up with big hits its a combination of a lot of different things
1576475 their offense is one of the best around they take their swings and they take their walks
1576476 i was a little nervous because it was the yankees and i never faced a team of that caliber before
1576477 ive been watching the yankees since i was little to pitch against them was unbelievable
1576478 i just tried to put the ball in play every game against those guys is a high energy game it felt to get rbis in that situation
1576479 el anuncio que est haciendo la junta de integrar las huellas digitales ser a la forma de sellar el proceso de depuraci n de la c dula dominicana que es una de las m s seguras de am rica y pienso que integrando las huellas ser pr cticamente imposible que pueda ser sustituida o suplantada
1576480 paras fines de las elecciones no tendr ning n efecto porque para leer y comparar huellas se necesitan equipos especiales y no se puede contar con eso para elecciones porque habr a que tener un equipos en cada colegio electoral
1576481 i feel like i need to be turning that water into wine
1576482 in certain in ways im lucky to be out there
1576483 i threw all right my movement was a little bit off
1576484 its been a nice resurrection for them and for him
1576485 we needed to win a game regardless of how we won it
1576486 we lost four straight and i dont think we played bad baseball until that last inning
1576487 thats not a good indication right off the bat as to how to go about that situation
1576488 youve got a four run lead and youre going out there to get three outs unfortunately i wasnt able to do that
1576489 lets not get ahead of ourselves thats how it is right now thats how its got to be nothing replaces what we had here in wagner so weve just got to hold the fort tread water down there until billy gets back
1576490 when i first got here i was a little timid but everybody was so welcoming the cast and crew are really tight now we try to make time to go out on weekends together
1576491 i was a total education geek i loved school i loved learning i loved doing homework all of my books and view all archives
1576492 senator mccain wants americans to forget that during the republican primary he said that americans were better off than we were eight years ago and that he thinks weve made great progress economically he wants us to forget that hes fully embraced the bush policies he once opposed and bragged about supporting those policies more than 90 percent of time the truth is being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades it isnt having a campaign run by washington lobbyists and its certainly not promoting the same policies that have led america down the wrong path these past eight years
1576493 i actually played well i just had basically a train wreck on three holes
1576494 i really didnt have any bogeys except for the doubles so thats going to put you back a few i fought back which is great but a few things could have gone a little better
1576495 match play is really the only part of the tournament that really matters
1576496 i would have liked to have been low stroke but i got into match play and tomorrow is when the tournament really begins
1576497 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1576498 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1576499 visa applications from non accredited persons do not fall within the iocs remit and we are therefore not best placed to answer you on this question
1576500 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
1576501 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1576502 of course i would have liked to have been there advocating for a peaceful resolution
1576503 a dish on a duck a bow on a bell a bird in a cage a pearl in the shell
1576504 the selection of accans founding board members will provide a driving force for the establishment of a more powerful voice in the development of telecommunications policy and industry processes
1576505 what we need is an effective voice for residential and small business consumers particularly in light of nbn migration choice and complexity issues
1576506 in life and even more so in politics its all about integrity and taking a firm stand never wavering say it mean it back it up
1576507 just as importantly bachmann states our campaign greatly appreciates and invites all our college student voters and supporters to get involved as so many have already
1576508 i am taking off the old crown and you may hear some crunching

1576517 throw the jews in the oven this november its the only way we can free america and make sure barack obama is elected
1576518 lets pretend that mccains right and that this was a way of bringing his age up what exactly is it that makes it a cheap shot is mccain trying to tell us that hes not really frackin old are we not allowed to talk about it because seriously folks its not like this isnt an issue age is the one immutable characteristic that is actually relevant mccains what 71 now right hell be 72 before he takes office and that means that if he gets elected and reelected hell be 80 when he leaves office he cant tell us his minds going to be all there in eight years he cant tell us itll be all there in four years he just cant he cant know that hes really old old people start to deteriorate they get alzheimers they get parkinsons they get dementia
1576519 if i had any doubts this is the deal breaker
1576520 the question before us is who is appearing in the appeal is it the chinese name or the muslim name
1576521 there is no dispute as to the identity of the appellant there is no confusion because the appellant is the same person as the name stated in the appeal application
1576522 the right authority to determine her legal entity is the nrd based on her ic therefore the appellant must get approval from the nrd to change the muslim name to her chinese name which was rejected by the nrd
1576523 das ist eine riesenehre und auszeichnung f r mich es wird mir kalt den r cken runterlaufen wenn ich ins stadion einlaufen darf

1576528 and to answer your question im a child of what we at the archive call the ripple effect
1576529 actually no but its the best way to describe a multi dimensional fluctuation of linear time and perspectives in 4 dimensional space

1576538 brad pitt be damned he had nothing on osgoods rookie skill and sad eyes
1576539 there was actually a day in high school when i wrote on a name tag mrs osgood and wore it the whole day i really thought we were perfect for each other id love to meet him and probably apologize that things never worked out

1576542 this case is a reminder that computer crimes are not confined within national borders
1576543 with the worldwide reach of the internet criminals can now operate from almost anywhere on the globe
1576544 the sheer number of retailers attacked by these cyber criminals demonstrates the much broader challenges in protecting sensitive consumer data from this increasing threat
1576545 eu diria que 70 por cento dos atletas da vila ol mpica fumam
1576546 para mim de cortar o cora o o que acontece com animais quando a pele arrancada de seu corpo

1576552 restrictions in the law over the past two decades have created a ridiculously ineffective program for reuniting owners with their lost or forgotten property
1576553 as state treasurer i am committed to returning unclaimed property to its rightful owner or heir i encourage pennsylvanians to read these ads to see if they recognize their name or the names of their family and friends so treasury can help them claim what is theirs
1576554 thousands of vehicles from both interstates including mine sat an estimated 50 minutes wasting thousands of dollars worth of 4 per gallon gasoline belching tons of emissions into the atmosphere
1576555 we usually get damage claims about stones kicked up from the roadway or overspray from painting i have never heard of anyone being compensated for the loss of gasoline
1576556 but i couldnt get over to the ramp before i got past it

1576580 n o tenho d vidas de que quando for competir na pr xima semana vou olhar para a esquerda e a direita e saberei que todas as garotas n o est o totalmente limpas isso uma desgra a perdi toda a f no sistema porque existem muitas atletas que est o driblando as normas
1576581 concordamos com tamsyn de que um problema mas um problema que o coi est se esfor ando para resolver
1576582 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1576583 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1576584 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1576585 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1576586 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
1576587 cada um pensa o que quer agora a gente tem que jogar treinar para ver no final o que vai dar
1576588 seis ou sete sele es s o favoritas qualquer uma pode ganhar qualquer uma pode perder depende de como as sele es estar o no dia da partida como v o jogar como v o trabalhar tudo o que precisa para ganhar uma medalha ol mpica

1576591 its an opportunity in fact an obligation at this point for everybody involved in this scenario to take a careful look at the security systems in place
1576592 created to acquaint you with the dark side of internet
1576593 the sheer number of retailers attacked by these cyber criminals demonstrates the much broader challenges in protecting sensitive consumer data from this increasing threat
1576594 this is as much a story about the lax security practices of the major retailers as it is the triumph of justice
1576595 what deplorable security practices what a bunch of leaky boats
1576596 they were watching data basically passing in the clear and they were able to access it they were basically eavesdropping on a conversation between a device and its intended server
1576597 they have tended to try to protect the data like a fortress or a castle the problem with that is the drawbridges are let down
1576598 youve got to protect the data itself data is currency on the internet now
1576599 eles sabiam que ela estava machucada deveriam ter me deixado de sobreaviso mas n o fizeram n o entraram em contato nem mesmo quando houve o corte tenho me mantido informada com o que vejo na imprensa

1576630 oh dear we dont want to put the country though another impeachment or even heavy investagations again whine whine whine
1576631 testicular fortitude when democrats cannot even muster the testosterone to act against the george bush and dick cheney
1576632 air heads if the republicans could put this country through clintons impeachment for such a friviolous incident why wouldnt the democrats stand up for our constitution as our bill of rights are being undermined by bush
1576633 he wont last a day in our custody do you
1576634 it is the clear sentiment of this board that more can and should be done to safeguard human life than has been the case to this point in the construction process
1576635 we believe these kind of measures just provide a false sense of security
1576636 the canal should not appear like a swimming pool that people can jump and swim across easily
1576637 the loss of human life in the canal to date has been a costly consequence to past indifference
1576638 da wird nicht nur die fassade gestrichen sondern richtig saniert
1576639 i felt like a dirty moth most of the time when they unrolled the tarp i wanted to fly to the light
1576640 we were rolling up the tarp so fast because the umpires wanted to get the game in i slipped into the green tarp my buddies just kept rolling it up
1576641 he said frederico is kind of small and slow and he just got swept up in the tsunami of green plastic hey im surprised it hasnt happened before
1576642 i could breathe so it wasnt too bad plus i began to feel like a moth so i prayed to the patron saint of moths saint pablo
1576643 i am going to remain silent and i would like to see my lawyer
1576644 this storm could bring in erratic winds and those conditions are the kind that can kill firefighters because in that wind the fires become explosive
1576645 you would have to be crazy who would want to turn themselves in
1576646 are people actually doing it i really find it hard to believe
1576647 gives you time to make arrangements and take care of your personal matters
1576648 it is a way for you to plan your return home
1576649 we understand the impact it has on them when we knock on their doors early in the morning and take them out of their homes
1576650 they dont want their children to go through the trauma of being arrested in the morning
1576651 noted by ice as a factor in your immigration records
1576652 for anyone to say no one will do it thats absolutely wrong
1576653 based on the context of the entire label we agree that the phrase in question refers to the brand name of the product and does not mislead consumers
1576654 there was a lot of faith involved the faith of my mother the faith of my friends and my own faith
1576655 sometimes that was all there was to hang onto unfortunately it took 25 years to come into play
1576656 once they got started i think they just could not turn off the machine
1576657 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1576658 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1576659 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1576660 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1576661 i feel flattered that the nra would feel that they would have to infiltrate ceasefire of pa obviously theyre hearing our footsteps
1576662 frankly i think its a waste of their money we dont deal in state secrets
1576663 that this cant be a crime because heavenly father is the one that tells jeffs when a girl is ready to get married and that he is only following the word of heavenly father
1576664 various landmarks in the united states including new york city
1576665 chemical substances in gel and liquid form that were sealed in bottles and glass jars

1576668 we have to fix your head cause your brains on the blink
1576669 sometimes i wonder what im gonna do there aint no cure for the summertime blues
1576670 psst lets go to a crusade pose as christians and get rid of anyone who is stupid enough to come down and assume the title of jesus christ
1576671 he will guide you into all truth he will not speak on his own he will speak only what he hears or sees and he will tell you what is yet to come
1576672 we have been saying we are reviewing flights due to surging fuel prices
1576673 the financial crisis and its knock on effects continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector in the second quarter 2008 again with significant differentiation between the results of the players
1576674 in this context bnp paribas again delivered robust operating results in all its business units
1576675 hey i should probably make it up to you for waking you up and all and take you out to dinner sometime
1576676 for the period 1 july 2007 to 30 june 2008 inclusive ebitda before significant items was 652 9 million dollars in line with ascianos previous market guidance
1576677 the proceeds will be used to fund future growth opportunities and to provide additional flexibility for asciano in respect of its longer term capital structure
1576678 yeah i can hold off on reading the bible today or i think i have enough strength to do this or this today

1576680 er ist guter dinge und wurde am morgen von familienangeh rigen besucht
1576681 suffering is the single greatest challenge to the christian faith
1576682 nederlanders dekten zich altijd al fors in tegen risicos die behoefte is nu vergroot
1576683 aldus een woordvoerder van het verbond voor verzekeraars per inwoner wordt er door de verzekeraars bijna vierduizend euro per jaar aan verkochte polissen opgestreken
1576684 polis kerja untuk umno bukan untuk raja dan rakyat malaysia
1576685 hanno anticipato o sono stati costretti ad anticipare le elezioni non a causa di inchieste ma per la pi semplice delle ragioni hanno perso la fiducia del pubblico e labilit di governare
1576686 preferibile venire a patti con la volont collettiva del pubblico ed accorciare il periodo tra le elezioni a due anni e mezzo
1576687 il regime di hamas a gaza ha deciso di mostrare al mondo che cosa capace di fare
1576688 ancora una volta abbiamo un legame tra la sinistra mondiale ed il regno del male
1576689 de realiteit is dat dit mooie symbool doelwit van protesten is geworden
1576690 de hoogleraar noemt een aantal oorzaken voor het stijgende aantal donaties zo worden nederlanders ouder en rijker
1576691 suffering is the single greatest challenge to the christian faith
1576692 suffering is the single greatest challenge to the christian faith
1576693 its not whether you get knocked down its whether you get up
1576694 leaders are made they are not born they are made by hard effort which is the price which all of us must pay to achieve any goal that is worthwhile
1576695 once you agree upon the price you and your family must pay for success it enables you to ignore the minor hurts the opponents pressure and the temporary failures
1576696 perfection is not attainable but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence
1576697 show me a good loser and ill show you a loser
1576698 some people try to find things in this game that dont exist but football is only two things blocking and tackling
1576699 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather a lack of will
1576700 the leader can never close the gap between himself and the group if he does he is no longer what he must be he must walk a tightrope between the consent he must win and the control he must exert
1576701 the price of success is hard work dedication to the job at hand and the determination that whether we win or lose we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand
1576702 i wish they tortured those pieces of shit before killing them
1576703 the concept is still good connecting the dots of the bits and pieces of possible information is a good thing it just shouldnt be in a counterintelligence database
1576704 consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate
1576705 i dont think id want to run their weather modification program
1576706 i hope they have clear weather just so they dont have to try anything
1576707 i wish they tortured those pieces of shit before killing them
1576708 i wish they tortured those pieces of shit before killing them
1576709 the civilization that we as whites created in europe and america could not have developed apart from the genetic endowments of the creating people nor is there any reason to believe that the civilization can be successfully transmitted by a different people
1576710 i wish they tortured those pieces of shit before killing them
1576711 anyone who knows who and where you are is a security hole
1576712 i own a gun i have an escape route if someone comes im ready
1576713 plankton levels are dropping bees are dying there are tortilla riots in mexico the highest wheat prices in 30 odd years
1576714 the question we have to answer is how do we kill four of the worlds six billion people in the most just way possible
1576715 weev the troll who thought hacking the epilepsy site was immoral
1576716 is legendary among trolls he is said to have jammed the cellphones of daughters of c e o s and demanded ransom from their fathers he is also said to have trashed his enemies credit ratings better documented are his repeated assaults on livejournal an online diary site where he himself maintains a personal blog working with a group of fellow hackers and trolls he once obtained access to thousands of user accounts
1576717 i asked fortuny how he could troll me if he so chose he writes
1576718 many trolling practices like prank calling the hendersons and intimidating kathy sierra violate existing laws against harassment and threats
1576719 the difficulty is tracking down the perpetrators in order to prosecute investigators must subpoena sites and internet service providers to learn the original authors ip address and from there his legal identity local police departments generally dont have the means to follow this digital trail and federal investigators have their hands full with spam terrorism fraud and child pornography
1576720 hacks like this tell you to watch out by hitting you with a baseball bat
1576721 demonstrating these kinds of exploits is usually the only way to get them fixed
1576722 so the message is buy a helmet and the medium is a bat to the head
1576723 estamos complacidos de que harald se una a nosotros en este puesto estrategico extremadamente importante
1576724 con su rica experiencia en la produccion de software de software libre y su sobresaliente reputacion en la comunidad mundial harald jugara un papel invaluable para ayudarnos a implementar nuestra estrategica iniciativa de desarrollo de controladores de codigo abierto
1576725 para mi es muy emocionante estar trabajando con via justo en el momento en que la compania incrementa sus esfuerzos hacia el codigo abierto
1576726 busco trabajar con los equipos directivos y de investigacion y desarrollo de la empresa para garantizar que no solo entiendan mejor las necesidades de los programadores sino que tambien construyan una relacion productiva y de alta calidad con la comunidad
1576727 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1576728 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1576729 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1576730 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1576731 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
1576732 si pones que la fecha de expiracion de la tarjeta es 2015 la rechaza y aqui puedes introducir lo que quieras
1576733 la gente esta picando sabemos que ha habido problemas en australia y nueva zelanda
1576734 they put their back into it this legislative session and there is the record to show for it
1576735 its not just the number of measures its the weight and substance of them the transformative quality of them
1576736 im not that interested in gambling per se its the jobs and the revenues i cared about
1576737 gov patrick has been a complete failure as governor he has raised taxes and broken promises
1576738 every day that goes by is another job lost another family that moves out of the commonwealth and another giveaway to the special interests
1576739 we are in the midst of a fundamental shift in the massachusetts energy landscape and i am proud to help shepherd these changes forward
1576740 its a little surprising to me to see how much of the business of the legislature is done like almost every other human institution where it waits to the end and theres a flurry to get it all done
1576741 at this point he provided essentially no biographical data about himself before 1993
1576742 in connection with a missing person report back in the early 1990s
1576743 our experience tells us hes more of a schemer than someone who has lost his memory
1576744 he loves his daughter kidnapping doesnt apply it was his own kid
1576745 just because hes reighs natural father it doesnt absolve him
1576746 motorola is the pioneer in mobile devices and im honored to become co ceo of this company and ceo of the mobile devices business i welcome the chance to lead this company into the future while working to create a successful independent mobile devices company that will continue to innovate and grow for years to come i look forward to working closely with greg the board the senior leadership team and motorolas talented hard working and dedicated associates around the globe to build value for our stockholders
1576747 we are now finding wnv in the greater boston area and southeastern and western massachusetts consistently
1576748 people should consider the virus as being established in these areas for the summer in addition we are continuing to find virus in new areas the warm wet summer is continuing to support mosquito populations and allowing the virus to spread
1576749 they are quite aware of what our need is here on the cape and aware of the plans that we have made through opencape to make the difference that we need here
1576750 opencape is extremely excited about the opportunity this law creates to allow the residents of cape cod to finally address the inadequate telecommunications infrastructure of the region
1576751 the governor and his team have demonstrated exceptional leadership in addressing this issue
1576752 im glad the governor and the legislature are on the same page to help cape businesses improve their competitive status
1576753 the next time i was contacted was to tell me the results of the investigation
1576754 i would say i had a pretty good view being within 2 feet of this officer
1576755 to me it was directed toward your competency and what you saw
1576756 i certainly wanted to at least give you the opportunity to respond to that
1576757 when theres something that doesnt seem right we need more people to step up so i appreciate that
1576758 we have citizens that are in fear of our own police department
1576759 i think the community is extremely lucky to be able to protect this land we take a significant amount of our total water supply out of this watershed
1576760 i thought it was very successful on behalf of the town
1576761 this is a long term investment for the town the protection of those wells
1576762 it was another good work out it was a good game with four goals for us and good play
1576763 but the players arent 100 per cent yet that would be difficult right now
1576764 the other team were fitter than us but you could see we were passing pressing and the understanding between the players was better i am really pleased with the result
1576765 normally when you have quality when you are playing well and creating chances you will score goals
1576766 ik ben een kritisch ioc lid en als het nodig is zal ik hierover zeker de microfoon pakken dat doe ik wel vaker mijn argument is niet alleen de traditie maar ook de zeer hoge kosten
1576767 de realiteit is dat dit mooie symbool van de hoop doelwit van protest is geworden door de enorme mediabelangstelling is de tocht hier ideaal voor door het herstellen van de oude traditie voorkom je tevens dat dit olympische symbool kapot gaat
1576768 sport gaat altijd voor politiek dat wil niet zeggen dat ik de wereld zwart wit zie de olympische gedachte is er een van verbroedering en daarvoor is nodig dat atleten uit alle landen zonder problemen naar de spelen kunnen reizen op de achtergrond speelde eind 19e eeuw ook dat men hoopte nooit meer een grote bloedige oorlog mee te maken de verenigde naties roept niet voor niets alle strijdende partijen in de wereld op tot een wapenstilstand zodat sporters vrij en zonder gevaar naar de olympische spelen kunnen komen die wens stamt al uit het oude olympia
1576769 de beste manier om deze ongerustheid weg te nemen is door middel van toetsing
1576770 ze hopen tegen wil en dank dat ze ergens vastgehouden wordt
1576771 dat is niet mijn mama dat is een vreemde die mij van mijn mama heeft weggehaald
1576772 we hebben een aanbod gekregen voor over de vloer de film misschien is dit wel te hoog gegrepen maar ik denk er serieus over na het zou natuurlijk t grappig zijn
1576773 ik zal wel een beetje de stijl van geer aannemen want het is toch zijn feestje ik ga met zijn styliste praten want een beetje hysterisch mag wel alleen geen veren
1576774 hij was direct enthousiast toen ik hem vroeg en heel verbaasd dat ik hem erbij wilde we zullen een duet zingen want we klinken zo goed samen het sprak eigenlijk vanzelf dat hij mee zou doen als we straks misschien ook die film gaan doen kom ik helemaal nooit meer van hem af haha
1576775 mijn entree zal legendarisch worden het moet een verrassing blijven maar het heeft met hoogwerk te maken geen bungee jump of zo dat durf ik niet zul je net zien dat uitgerekend ik weer een elastiek heb dat het niet houdt
1576776 all human wisdom is summed up in two words wait and hope
1576777 ik weet niet van waar dit verhaal komt er is niets van waar
1576778 it was very scary because you go from being a healthy 32 year old guy to being in the hospital for five days
1576779 i kept on telling the neurologist and everything listen i want to run the race
1576780 i have a lot of friends that said they would do it and theyre gonna do it
1576781 this grant was developed after six months of planning by ceda to identify specific needs within the community and to develop programs and projects to meet those needs
1576782 this grant will help wareham families and businesses at a time when we need it most
1576783 every staff member believes that these students need to have counseling
1576784 we are on our way to becoming a great school i believe
1576785 i have been looking for someone with the passion drive and intellect to fill this position
1576786 when i interviewed her over this past weekend i could tell that she was the ideal person for this job
1576787 there will be a lot more to say in the future but for now i wanted those of you who care to know that im no longer with the station im sorry i was not allowed to say goodbye i really wanted to
1576788 i really enjoyed my tenure at wsar and my time talking with so many people in the county i now have a unique opportunity to make an impact on their lives through my new position at the district attorneys office
1576789 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1576790 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1576791 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1576792 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1576793 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1576794 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1576795 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1576796 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1576797 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1576798 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1576799 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1576800 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1576801 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1576802 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1576803 has a legal and moral obligation to make official statements first to the victims and their families then the public
1576804 and thats the order in which were going to do it
1576805 while we are relieved that none of our members or chapters were at risk we grieve for the victims of the anthrax attacks and their families and on behalf of our members express our sympathy to all who have been personally touched by these tragic events
1576806 ive got healthy skepticism its good to be the skeptic the bottom line is we want to see this perpetrator brought to justice
1576807 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1576808 the inflation fight probably will have to wait until 2009
1576809 conditions at this point do not seem to dictate an immediate tightening
1576810 labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1576811 there are things that i wish id urged her to do things i wish id said things i wish i hadnt said
1576812 now the hold is off and i am open for business 100 percent of the time and really looking forward to working with you on behalf of this city and state that we love
1576813 its fraught with animal welfare concerns and it does not bring back a loved one
1576814 a dead animals dna does not guarantee the offspring will be identical to the deceased it takes more than just genes to create an animal
1576815 we dont need new sources to compete with animal shelters and reputable breeders
1576816 the cells status was indeed bad as they had been stored for a long time
1576817 but the scientific technology has also developed compared with when we cloned snuppy there is no room for any doubt over whether they are real clones
1576818 i believe that booger was an angel that god rented out to me for a short period of time
1576819 and he knew i would be lost without him so he sent me some more he sent me five more mini boogers
1576820 1996 que escribi dirigi y particip l mismo como actor armageddon
1576821 mr asbahi has informed the campaign that he no longer wishes to serve in his volunteer position and we are in the process of searching for a new national arab american and muslim american outreach coordinator
1576822 we need muslim americans to get excited about the campaign and theres a lot to get excited about
1576823 i served on that board for only a few weeks before resigning as soon as i became aware of public allegations against another member of the board
1576824 since concerns have been raised about that brief time i am stepping down
1576825 the issue of screening for prostate cancer is frankly an area of medicine that remains somewhat unsettled
1576826 while its clear there is benefit to a significant number of men its equally clear that many men end up being diagnosed and treated for cancers that would likely not have caused them any significant harm
1576827 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1576828 thats because every 75 year old is not created equal
1576829 very active very vigorous and have minimal health issues and many of those men are going to live into their late 80s or 90s
1576830 it wouldnt be how we understand the operation functioning no doubt we can clear up the matter quickly
1576831 my face was pushed into the ground my arm was twisted and i was hit two or three times in the face
1576832 this is utterly unacceptable any time its particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics at a time when china has promised complete media freedom
1576833 fulfill its olympic bid commitments to increase access to information and expand freedom of the press
1576834 the japanese reporters violated the rules of china by forcing their way into a military area the act was not well justified and they should accept the consequences
1576835 i however apologize to the reporters as the top regional public security official for the clash they had with the border policemen
1576836 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions and your country is a free society
1576837 the majority of the korean people have been eagerly waiting for your visit
1576838 and of course behind these people there were those who were sort of opposed
1576839 i admire your forthrightness your integrity and your deep love for the people of korea
1576840 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1576841 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1576842 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1576843 while there may be some who will protest i think you need to look at whats happening on the supermarket shelves
1576844 now i just want to take off my shoes my feet are pretty darn painful
1576845 i hope to go back home soon within a couple of days
1576846 this accident is a very sad and disastrous event in our mountaineering history
1576847 the game was there to be won we had opportunities not very many obviously but we never managed to take them
1576848 we gave away needless free kicks and corners which was always going to be a major problem in the game
1576849 we just didnt do well enough overall and i dont think we showed we were comfortable at any stage of the game
1576850 it seems fairly ridiculous that you can reach a european and then get knocked out at the first game of the next season but thats the way it has happened
1576851 i think the market is probably taking a little bit out of the tightening probabilities
1576852 i think the consensus is the fed will probably be at 2 per cent for some time now
1576853 i think if anything the tilt of the fed announcement was a little bit more toward the weakness in the economy than most had expected that may have been the only surprise
1576854 that probably might have been part of the reassurance for the bond market
1576855 probably the best hope that everybody has is that oil and commodity prices will come down fast enough to take the pressure off inflation
1576856 the numerous attacks that are made against the african american community
1576857 that was a huge undertaking in that the fathers at sacred heart had a lot of difficulty in trying to decide what they wanted to do with their property
1576858 when youre able to tie them all together it just makes a stronger grant application
1576859 were there changes yes but they were changes that were legal changes
1576860 such mutual clarification can pave the way for a speedy and transparent negotiating process with a bright prospect
1576861 the republic of iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1576862 the second phase of negotiations can commence as early as possible if there is such willingness
1576863 our offer is clear and their response is not clear
1576864 the iranian government needs to respond in a very clear way to the generous offer from the international community
1576865 its a stalling tactic reiterating that they have good will but not answering the exam question
1576866 to be fair to the iranians they do this kind of thing rather well
1576867 i dont see any reason to believe that the russians and the chinese are any more willing today to support really tougher sanctions against iran
1576868 teatro y desempe su primer papel como una alemana en

1576870 you would have to be crazy who would want to turn themselves in
1576871 are people actually doing it i really find it hard to believe
1576872 gives you time to make arrangements and take care of your personal matters
1576873 it is a way for you to plan your return home
1576874 we understand the impact it has on them when we knock on their doors early in the morning and take them out of their homes
1576875 they dont want their children to go through the trauma of being arrested in the morning
1576876 noted by ice as a factor in your immigration records
1576877 for anyone to say no one will do it thats absolutely wrong
1576878 were trying in every way to make use of what comes out of a household
1576879 this is an important development because something that used to be thrown away in significant amounts into the landfill now has good use
1576880 security was tight and was a bit over controlling which is par for the course at these events and as par for the course i tried to get near the candidate when i saw another reporter there alex leary security tried to throw me out but i found a mccain staffer i knew and the person vouched for me
1576881 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1576882 race played absolutely no role in any actions taken by our employees or anybody else in this case
1576883 it was just a really crazy situation we were being carted out of there and everyone was looking
1576884 im upset because my reporter was singled out for whatever reason that bothers me were just trying to figure out what that reason was
1576885 i think it was about security and security acting overzealous and security singling out a black reporter to be removed
1576886 thats not giving mccain a pass on it i think his campaign does have an obligation to figure out what happened and to make sure it doesnt happen again
1576887 so she jumped out and ran to the foot of the bed
1576888 i would just say were helping judge kornmann out what he does is up to him
1576889 its always been speculated that democratic judges hold on to their seats until they die or a democratic president is assured so they can pass the seat on to another democratic judge
1576890 to guarantee that judges concerned about politics cant manipulate the replacement process
1576891 mr whaley is very pleased with the decision of judge kane and knew that the truth would come out eventually about these allegations
1576892 were looking forward to trial and for his name to be cleared
1576893 we will be preparing and moving forward with the case
1576894 if i wanted to die i hope i would die in my sleep not by fire
1576895 we look forward to assisting the district attorneys office in any way possible with the upcoming prosecution
1576896 its kind of like saying theres a bunch of money on the street
1576897 its something the industry is taking seriously youd be in a bad place if you werent doing something about it
1576898 you can bet that the internet providers are going to stay tightlipped about any attacks on their networks
1576899 there might be one or two things that havent leaked yet
1576900 no one should even think they know the subject of the talk
1576901 quite frankly all the pieces of this have been staring us in the face for decades and none of us saw it until dan put it all together
1576902 this is the mother lode all right from the point of view of internet criminals looking for easier access to other peoples money and secrets
1576903 sure fire ways to remove grease and manure from jeans

1576906 quando parliamo di societ attive nel mondo della moda abbiamo a che fare con un approccio molto sospettoso alle nuove tecnologie forse perch maggiormente abituate a imporre le proprie decisioni spiega panbianco un primo passaggio importante stato fatto qualche anno fa con lavvento di un sito web mentre oggi stato compiuto qualche ulteriore passo in avanti proponendo via web i video delle sfilate una forma di marketing che sta riscuotendo favori da parte del pubblico
1576907 stiamo assistendo a un momento nel quale i grandi marchi si avvicinano all e commerce precisa panbianco e il prossimo passaggio che mi aspetto sar una maggiore attenzione in fatto di comunicazione e pubblicit a livello web
1576908 fino a oggi il mondo della moda ha creduto poco nelle nuove tecnologie conclude david panbianco
1576909 we are very concerned about how the chinese authorities will handle the protests that will inevitably take place
1576910 i dont remember any other host cities having such areas of protests
1576911 if the olympics are successful the perception of political risk will continue to be lowered even more
1576912 foreigners will be interested in moving more money or setting up in china
1576913 if the news is more positive than negative about china during the games it will help lift chinas overall image and promote tourism for china
1576914 many of our raw materials are the type that would be affected by these environmental cleanup measures
1576915 everybody is saying that the situation would be better after the games
1576916 beijing is increasingly fearful that growth will slow to a level which will not create sufficient new jobs to fuel the rapid rise in living standards
1576917 in china theres no such top sports clubs or famous leagues like the nba or british soccer that can rent these sites and support their frequent use
1576918 going to make it worse for us well have to fly from lax and the lines there are 10 times worse
1576919 they had pretty good fares and i could fly home nonstop i am going to have to find another way
1576920 the business community will take a bit of a hit here in its effort to get to destinations important to them
1576921 the big question is going to be how that affects fares
1576922 we had to fight tooth and nail with these people it was very frustrating
1576923 a number of scientific studies indicate that acrylamide can cause cancer in laboratory animals and available information suggests that acrylamide is likely to cause cancer in humans
1576924 it became clear that wed be going to trial and that this was a case we could win
1576925 to be suddenly cast in the world series is unusual
1576926 shes had a few moments where she has said something that has gotten her in trouble but no one goes from having never playing baseball to getting hits
1576927 there are many women in this country who are not and yet many of them will support john mccain
1576928 she electrifies a room when she comes in and she has an ability to inspire
1576929 were finding ourselves picking up conventions that we have not been able to attract to los angeles
1576930 they see changes that have taken place if i can get you here to see the changes we have an excellent chance of booking it
1576931 the tourism and travel industries are keeping us strong despite a slowdown in the national economy and we are adding new attractions to make sure this upward trend continues
1576932 estar ntimamente con un hombre casado cuando mi padre enga a mi madre no es algo que me perdonar a no podr a mirar mi reflejo en la ma ana si hiciera eso no me sentir a atra da hacia un hombre que ser a capaz de enga ar a su esposa
1576933 porque el matrimonio es simplemente algo por lo que has firmado
1576934 i do think we grew more sensitive to the need for critical review of papers likely to initiate or continue the kind of controversy that results in a whiplash effect
1576935 words that we as scientists use to express uncertainty routinely get dropped out to make stories have more punch and be stronger
1576936 they convey meaning to readers not only in the story at hand but more generally about science being less precise than is typically conveyed
1576937 a priest also when he celebrates the eucharist must serve god and the people with dignity and humility and by his bearing and by the way he says the divine words he must convey to the faithful the living presence of christ
1576938 this sacrifice then as the passion of christ itself even though it is offered for everyone has no effect if not in those who unite thmesleves to the passion of christ through faith and charity
1576939 may the lord accept the sacrifice at your hands for the praise and glory of his name for our good and the good of all his holy church
1576940 devoutly and faithfully the mysteries of christ for the praise of god and the sanctification of the christian people according to the tradition of the church
1576941 the mystery of the eucharist is too great for anyone to permit himself to treat it according to his own whim so that its sacredness and its universal ordering would be obscured
1576942 the ars celebrandi is the fruit of faithful adherence to the liturgical norms in all their richness indeed for two thousand years this way of celebrating has sustained the faith life of all believers
1576943 an authentic liturgical action expresses the sacredness of the eucharistic mystery this should be evident from the words and actions of the priest who celebrates as he intercedes to god the father both with the faithful and on their behalf
1576944 the ars celebrandi must foster a sense of the sacred and the use of outward signs which help to cultivate this sense such as for example the harmony of the rite the liturgical vestments the furnishings and the sacred place
1576945 we think we can give the dark knight a run for no 1 but nobodys been able to beat it yet
1576946 the film industry for so many years has been dependent on young males
1576947 but new technologies including video games have distracted that population disproportionately
1576948 well have a better sense on thursday morning after we start to see the grosses
1576949 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
1576950 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
1576951 hes had some medical issues but youre never ready for something like this
1576952 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family
1576953 he had a huge impact on a lot of peoples lives and he had a huge impact on my life
1576954 during the season we spent more time together than we did with our families and our lives
1576955 it was a good test for us and we played against a great team who are well ahead of us in terms of preparation
1576956 they were really organised we played much better in the second half as we kept the ball more and the last 15 minutes were important as we kept the lead
1576957 i was pleased mostly with the evolution of the team and the way we played together
1576958 the tone method and content were all hideous we had rarely heard such strong and offensive comments made by an experienced professional about his colleague and were in italy
1576959 that doesnt even cover the errors which considering mourinhos perfectionism were probably planted there on purpose concerning ranieris age and trophy haul
1576960 what was truly ugly in his words was the extreme arrogance which had been glimpsed in his premier league experience but now we have experienced it first hand its even more direct and painful
1576961 we can end this here its 3 1 to him but my goal was beautiful no one likes to lose but i accept it
1576962 youth mentorship workshops in nyc la and san francisco that will invite local children to participate in creative workshops such as sign painting photography skateboard graphic design toy design filmmaking tattoo art footwear design and zine making taught by featured beautiful losers artists including barry mcgee ed templeton tobin yelland eric elms geoff mcfetridge shepard fairey mike mills todd james cheryl dunn kaws mr
1576963 look at me im doing this and no one will stop me
1576964 ignore me for i am probably just a cute little blond nine year old girl with pigtails riding a pink bicycle
1576965 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
1576966 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free
1576967 wow ha this is really unique and in my expert opinion it would only serve to enhance and bring more business to us at name of search engine withheld for legal amp confidentiality reasons and not cause us to lose business in the slightest amazing
1576968 buckling down and pressing my secret to its fullest potential
1576969 well see just how long i can make it available before it saturates things
1576970 hes already so amazingly rich that whether he continues or discontinues its sale will neither make nor break the man but not grabbing it for yourself while its still available could prove disastrous for you as you may only have one chance and a very limited one at that to get this
1576971 there have been claims in various published technical articles and newsgroup postings that windows xp always reserves 20 percent of the available bandwidth for qos these claims are incorrect one hundred percent of the network bandwidth is available to be shared by all programs unless a program specifically requests priority bandwidth
1576972 that astrology is astronomy brought down to earth and applied to the affairs of men
1576973 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
1576974 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free

1576987 democrats in the state by and large are upper income high education liberal what youd think of as elite democrats not blue collar folks
1576988 shes just a democrat in whats still a largely republican district
1576989 we got it at the right time with the runner in scoring position with one swing of the bat it could have gone either way and this time it went our way
1576990 weve all been walking the train tracks just like they did all our lives
1576991 this was part of the impetus for the anti gang programs in houston
1576992 as head of the largest aids center i dealt with a large number of ethiopian hiv and aids patients and through them became aware of the magnitude of this problem in ethiopia
1576993 ntds are one of the most evident hallmark signs of poverty and neglect significantly contributing to the persistence of this situation in a very large number of countries in africa asia and south america
1576994 they have been largely neglected by the western developed countries since they are practically nonexistent there
1576995 it costs much less than what it takes to fight the more recognized epidemics like aids tuberculosis and malaria
1576996 we have yet to achieve bias free health care this has serious public health implications as we know that higher levels of screening lead to lower levels of mortality clinicians need to be aware that they may be sending signals even unintentionally that lead minorities to believe they are being discriminated against
1576997 respondents answered yes or no to was there ever a time that you would have gotten better medical care if you had belonged to a different ethnic group however we were not able to ask why they felt discriminated against
1576998 this contradicts the general assumption in public health that having a usual source of care is a cure all
1576999 if men felt discriminated against by their regular health care provider they did not receive screening so there is something else factoring in
1577000 for example african american men may be stereotyped as being more violent which would affect how doctors respond to them and thus create a potential for discrimination
1577001 the longer someone delays screening the worse the outcome perception of discrimination may be driving the differences we see in outcomes among minorities
1577002 one thing led to another and thats when mrs osteen assaulted continental flight attendant sharon brown
1577003 she threw her against the lavatory door and she elbowed her in her breast
1577004 the flight attendant went bonkers she flipped out acted rashly and now wants to be paid for it
1577005 and they left on their own law enforcement was never involved
1577006 food allergic individuals need to increase the awareness of their food allergy among the people around them
1577007 this would include not only telling them that they are food allergic but also showing them how to treat them and how to recognize signs of an ongoing reaction
1577008 there are serious issues that need to be addressed in terms of educating these young adults that it is of utmost importance to not only maintain emergency medication but to have it with you at all times
1577009 until all students who display symptoms of a severe reaction are receiving epinephrine i would say that theres a significant gap that needs to be closed
1577010 this is a time to feel the pride of china and to welcome the world to our home
1577011 there has for years now been interaction between china and the rest of the world but this is the time for us to show all that we can offer all that we can be
1577012 this is a dream come true for the chinese people
1577013 to have the olympic games means china stands on the stage with all of the great powers of the world this is the first olympics for china and the hope can be that china will some day be host for as many olympics as the united states this year we are introducing beijing to the world but we have many other great cities that maybe you do not know
1577014 we will wear our olympic costumes when we watch the events on television and feel like we are a part of the celebration
1577015 on some nights our family will go to a restaurant or a public place and watch the sports with our neighbors and know that seven long years of preparation has paid off
1577016 a happy buddha in your home is a memory of a happy china olympics
1577017 this represents the first demonstration that kidney injury in membranous nephropathy can regress after selective depletion of b cells thus the present data provide a strong rationale for using rituximab to treat patients with membranous nephropathy
1577018 whether this may apply to other similar kidney conditions and may translate into long term protection from renal function loss and the potentially life threatening complications remains to be established
1577019 it really looks like the track of edouard is heading right to that section
1577020 as long as we could have some good consistent rain that would really help us out this could be a wonderful thing if we do not receive high winds or flooding in the area
1577021 well partner big to big and acquire big to small or to medium
1577022 i am a virgo 9 8 56 seeing a taurus 5 4 55 in january he announced he had a long distance girlfriend i committed to helping him with his business and did we continue to see each other as a couple when were not together were talking on a phone or chatting online even from his girlfriends is this a case of having your cake and eating it too will he decide which one of us he wants
1577023 the best way to appoach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1577024 they got a lot to do they got to show a verification regime that we can trust
1577025 you have a choice to make you can verifiably do what you say youre going to do or you continue to be the most sanctioned regime in the world
1577026 the human rights abuses in this stalinist country still exist and persist the north korean leader has yet to fully verify a highly enriched uranium programme and there are still more steps to be done on the plutonium programme
1577027 in order to get off the axis of evil list then the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1577028 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1577029 under the circumstances its hard to talk about what comes next
1577030 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1577031 irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises
1577032 how absolutely fantastic and special this find is can only be realized when you hold in your hand this magnificent one centimeter piece of clay and know that it survived 2 600 years in the debris of the destruction and came to us complete and in perfect condition
1577033 its not often that such discoveries happen in which real figures of the past shake off the dust of history and so vividly revive the stories of the bible
1577034 youve got my report youve read it what doesnt make sense
1577035 better than some public museums better than our police station man traps biometic whatsits armed guards thermal sensors and cameras well get to those later but youre pretty much ready for anything right you were ready for something
1577036 so what doesnt make sense he killed everybody youre wasting time
1577037 come on help me out here buddy how did he get in here
1577038 he came in one of the crates we get deliveries several times a week i dont know when probably early yesterday morning
1577039 so he was in there all day in the crate i mean
1577040 uhm they usually open the crates in the evening after the guests have left i wasnt there when they opened the crate i supervise the lobby i greet our guests and i supervise their visits i heard the call on the radio an intruder they said an intruder came from one of the crates
1577041 you couldnt fit in it ive read yogis can do this sort of thing but not you
1577042 and you could hear them running after him shooting at him
1577043 sure lets start with him you said he was so fast you saw him right
1577044 well did it take five six seven minutes to do all that to kill those people
1577045 you have to understand i dont even have access to that floor it is simply not permitted its your job if youre even caught on the stairs
1577046 certain guards had special training those permitted on the third floor special few
1577047 no one said anything you just had clues smells and there were visitors to the third floor doctors nurses sometimes you heard gyros on the roof airlifting something in or maybe it was taking something away
1577048 get to the point what was on the third floor
1577049 you went up there you followed him what did you see
1577050 he must have gotten away someone must have had a gyro on the roof to help him escape
1577051 and he just came here to kill everyone in the building he didnt take anything
1577052 i wont know until the insurance auditors have completed their survey later on this afternoon
1577053 does your crazy circle toy have a ball or a mouse in it
1577054 allan you go to nettlestone village will can you take locksley manor little john youd better go to clun village and much you can have bonchurch djaq if you come with me youll be able to help edward if he needs it when we free him and marian is that clear
1577055 once you have dropped the families at their villages leave immediately and well reassemble outside knighton hall
1577056 thank goodness the sheriff isnt sending them to guard the moat until tomorrow it is a good thing they havent looked down and noticed the peasants disappearing
1577057 the man that was just here i think his name was munch
1577058 munch chew or eat he said to wait for robin hood sorry i never was good at remembering names
1577059 my name is robin hood and here is one of my friends djaq do you know the sheriffs plot
1577060 that is why we are going to take you to knighton hall you can live there in peace just follow us and youll be fine
1577061 yes mlord you may not know but i am just filling in for my brother who is deaf im not the deaf one
1577062 thanks robin and djaq im wishing i hadnt mentioned the stocks to the sheriff when we were discussing forms of punishment
1577063 they cant have just disappeared i had them locked securely
1577064 im not being funny but maybe we should ask him
1577065 in the forest youre free i think that the forest is better than a castle or estate
1577066 when i own bonchurch lodge you will have to call me lord much
1577067 no he just had the larger title robin of locksley earl of huntingdon
1577068 we need a plan fast the sheriff is going to drown all the peasants by filling the moat
1577069 he is going to make the peasants from every village work to channel the river into the moat there will be guards surrounding the moat as of tomorrow so that the peasants cant escape hence the need for speed
1577070 these coins here are the castle and these coins around it are nettlestone village locksley manor clun village knighton hall and bonchurch lodge if we move four families to each village then that would be everyone out of the moat and into safety
1577071 master i have one request the peasants who go to bonchurch should call me lord much when i own the lands
1577072 come and well decide who goes to which village while we walk back to the castle
1577073 so how is shah mat the moat peasants but sheriff night watchman king holy land outlaws clever dead
1577074 we may capture one of robin hoods men if you do exactly what i tell you to we must be careful though because robin hood is in bow range i for one do not intend to die by means of his arrow
1577075 if you want me to believe you youre going to have to try better than that here lets give you another turn forget the rabbit and tell me do you have a tag you know a wooden tag with a symbol on it
1577076 yes but whats that got to do with the rabbit
1577077 i told you to forget the rabbit now on with my interrogation so you are one of robins merry men
1577078 and you just so happen to have one of robin hoods tags i know his tag when i see one because he gave me one when he visited once
1577079 oh that tag robin gave it to me after he helped me get out of trouble but that hardly makes me one of his men
1577080 youve almost convinced me maybe youre not lying now what sort of trouble would that have been
1577081 mlord this man feels familiar he is the one that your guards caught taking food from the pig trough like a prodigal son he was quite lost too when robin came to pardon those from locksley manor this man said he was from locksley manor then when robin didnt believe him he said to the jailer that there had been a mistake and that he was a visitor from rochdale and that was why his name was allan a dale believe me he was lost
1577082 well allan a dale from locksley manor rochdale and wherever you woke up this morning i have a surprise for you you are not going to be a merry man for much longer your lying certainly has not improved you are going back to the dungeons
1577083 gisborne guards when you have escorted this man to the dungeons meet me in the long hall
1577084 you will hang this evening the gallows have been gathering a bit of dust lately
1577085 now is my chance to see what the dungeons look like
1577086 i have to think of a way out of here
1577087 father i think i can get us out of here
1577088 i have a hair pin and it should be able to unlock
1577089 i am sorry that you should have come to be here
1577090 marian it is rather unfortunate that i should see you here if you could would you escape
1577091 marian i can free you but you would need to be protected from the sheriff i can give you that protection if you marry me
1577092 because you are a traitor you went off to the holy land and tried to kill king richard thats why
1577093 this may mean that king richard will return to england as a defeated crusader because nottingham castle is the centre of activity at present the broken king richard will most likely lay siege to the castle we therefore need to build up our defenses so that the throne will most certainly go to prince john and so to come to my point i have devised a way to get rid of the poorest citizens and build our defenses at the same time we will fill the moat
1577094 master if the sheriff kills allan then he wins and that would be
1577095 much just hush we need to think and that cannot be done while you are telling us what we already know all right
1577096 it should be easy enter the castle break into the dungeons rescue allan and any other prisoners rescue a few valuables humble the sheriff and gisborne and then leave but youre right i dont have a clue how to do this the whole place is locked down tight now and it is almost impossible to get into the castle grounds let alone the dungeons
1577097 robin we have to find a way to get in the future of england could be at stake remember the black knights no good can ever come out their plotting
1577098 well that is the best news that i have heard robin since i heard that you hadnt died in the sheriffs snake pit believe me it was terrifying to think of you being dead
1577099 you go and help that man unload his cart i suspect he is just delivering some grain oh and while youre at it you might as well make some money you could charge him tax or something
1577100 if anything goes wrong dont come to me for help i already have enough on my plate without having to bother about a merchant and his wares
1577101 yes answered the sheriff without thinking about who he was talking to
1577102 did you heed this mornings advice and buy tongue from the market or maybe you like pork its your choice really
1577103 i am sir walter of surrey and ever glad to be in your service
1577104 oh no so all the populace knows about my humiliation
1577105 when you and your fellow men are seated in the long hall then i will tell you my plan
1577106 very well but please do allow me to take a tour of the castle before we talk ive never been here before
1577107 dont worry some of my guards have been here before besides i dont get lost easily i have a wonderful sense of direction maybe even as good as the great robin hood
1577108 all right but please dont mention robin he is an enemy of the crown and has a price on head five hundred pounds to be precise
1577109 and am i to fill the bucket with a spoon
1577110 i dont care gisborne i want the moat to be filled by the end of this month guards go find the lady marian and her father sir edward
1577111 right now all i will suggest is that you go and search until they are found
1577112 the forest but there are some very unsavory characters round that neck of the woods sorry i mean the forest
1577113 yes i know that and i am suggesting you go and look there
1577114 mlord you werent serious about filling the moat with a bucket were you
1577115 i couldnt have been more serious gisborne i dont quite know why im asking you but whats a moat for anyway
1577116 right and exactly how is a dry moat going to offer protection
1577117 you see mlord it just soaks into the dirt what should i do
1577118 you may stop but next time you could do me a favour and tell me if my plan isnt working
1577119 robin what do we do about the leak in the roof we have to fix it we cant just leave it
1577120 dont worry it is too dark to do anything now and anyway i dont think its going to rain tonight if it does ill eat my hat well my hood
1577121 you are like a mouse in a trap after you are gone i will go back to england and marry marian
1577122 would you happen to know why i am as wet as a drowned rat
1577123 well it rained last night and you had another nightmare didnt you robin
1577124 yes i do sweat but not that much and remember the leak was over you
1577125 much where is the bucket of water that you put under the leak last night
1577126 so i can have drink now instead of going all the way down to the stream
1577127 not being funny but you didnt pour the whole lot on top of robin did you
1577128 before we fix the roof i would like to give you something
1577129 thank you edward i am sure you know how much this means for me and england when king richard sees this the sheriff and gisborne wont stand a chance just think
1577130 well now that we have written proof of all the traitors in this part of england we should give this document to the king
1577131 sorry allan but the roof needs waterproofing and i am not going to sleep under that drip ever again
1577132 much we will mend the hole today but i think that we should send a message to king richard letting him know that we will be coming
1577133 we could just send the pact with a trusted messenger
1577134 because if we are to get the pact to king richard who is in the holy land that means that we need to give it to him ourselves you cant trust anyone in these times its too dangerous
1577135 almost king richard needs us because i dont think he knows about operation shah mat
1577136 then why surely if he knows about the sheriffs plot why hasnt he sent word back acknowledging that he received our message
1577137 robin there is only one way to make sure that king richard knows about the sheriffs plot and that is to send another message king richard is winning the war at the moment he wont need you us
1577138 saladin hasnt been captured and if youre lucky he wont get captured
1577139 will we want the sultan to be captured and killed he is
1577140 well im sure that ah that you will all need some ah some food squirrel or chicken might be better
1577141 no if he is captured there will be peace king richard will come home and he will see the war going on in england
1577142 right then the sheriff says that as you are my guards you are to accompany me around the castle
1577143 when you are asked tell the sheriff and his men that robin hood visited
1577144 i say when youre kicked in the stomach and its empty
1577145 the last time we had anything to eat was four days ago
1577146 robin these people are from clun village and what they say is not true they havent eaten for six days
1577147 were not in the forest at the moment we dont gather food we buy it to help support the peasants that live in the castle do you mind if i come with you
1577148 we had better get out to the courtyard and wait for djaq and will there
1577149 you should learn not to tell a person that you are going to hang him you may go
1577150 gisborne go fetch the jailer i called for him some time ago
1577151 three guards and the jailer are locked in separate cells the guards told me when they went down into the dungeons robin hood and some other guards knocked them out and took the keys
1577152 what i want is the key get me a locksmith and make sure you get the best gisborne
1577153 mlord as you know only one man was commissioned to make the locks and keys dan scarlet and you ordered him to be killed so what do i
1577154 the other man capable of making duplicate keys is his son will scarlet
1577155 why cant people just love me and obey me and why cant i have absolute power
1577156 mlord if you were to let me free marian then i could talk her into going to the forest to find will scarlet and he could make us a key
1577157 clever thinking my boy but supposing marian doesnt find will and she escapes what then
1577158 oh i doubt she would run away she cares for her father too much to leave him sitting in the stocks
1577159 i think that we should go and buy the food on pit street
1577160 but today is market day there is bound to be plenty of food at the market
1577161 also the peasants that sell the food on pit street dont get taxed as high as when they go and sell their food at market
1577162 oh i see that looks like robin and the peasants
1577163 do you know the way to clun village from here
1577164 my humble citizens i am sure you are all aware of how important it is to obey the law without question otherwise you will be punished
1577165 unfortunately in our midst there are people who defy the law those who question it as i have said many times before they must be punished have an example made of them it is time to stir our stumps so to speak
1577166 so on this the third day of the tenth month in the year of our lord 1193 i hereby declare that edward of knighton representative of the nottingham council and marian of knighton daughter of edward are to be placed in the stocks for the duration of three days and three nights under the charge of speaking against the law
1577167 to add to the festivity why dont you throw a few refreshments to our guests tomatoes and eggs would do nicely
1577168 wonderful idea gisborne you are developing your nasty side quite nicely
1577169 i am offering ten pounds to the peasant who throws the first egg or tomato or anything
1577170 it will not last the sheriff is bound to make them throw at least one rotten tomato at us
1577171 people of knighton i have seen that you are not going to throw food at edward and marian of your own accord so i am giving you one last chance to throw the food or else i will have to enforce my words
1577172 sheriff if we are to throw any food it must come from your plate
1577173 i think that maybe you would like to see what is served on my plate
1577174 guards show this man what i like to eat for dinner
1577175 of course its an arrow i can see but whose arrow
1577176 a clue no tell me gisborne who fired that arrow
1577177 robin hood mlord i think that it would be wiser if we went back to the castle if there is a killer on the loose
1577178 then dont tell me what to do im the one who gives orders right guards out with his tongue
1577179 for goodness sake tell the guard to stand up i dont like it when people bow down to me and ask favors
1577180 sheriff if you do not want to join your guards in their fate let this man go with his tongue
1577181 master we have to go there is a whole wagon load of guards coming
1577182 much you go with the rest of the band ill come once i have finished my speech
1577183 if by any chance you actually like eating tongue buy some from the market it tastes much better
1577184 he has had a higher calling and we are going to follow them
1577185 come on split up into teams of two and whatever you do keep hidden
1577186 maintaining and adding new features to legacy systems developed using c c is a daunting task
1577187 the bitnami project released lappstack a free easy to install distribution of apache postgresql php and supporting libraries
1577188 the var guy is in the market for a small office printer that supports ubuntu linux mac os x and windows xp
1577189 mythtv now has a new competitor and that is boxee
1577190 like you i find these camps intolerable but i find equally intolerable the use made of them every day in the bourgeois press
1577191 so the production offset is more likely to approach 800 thousand barrels per day a tidy sum and a worthwhile target for savings but not equal to ocs output
1577192 finally without knowing what production volumes could be expected from lifting the ban on ocs drilling moratoria its impossible to assert that taking these fuel savings actions would exceed future offshore oil volumes and in fact one might argue that the combination of achieving these savings and developing new supply would doubly enhance us energy security

1577196 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1577197 the wording is a little strong over inflation but theres really no real change in policy
1577198 i think they are trying to buy time to allow the economy to recover and so that the financials can slowly repair
1577199 we apologize for the confusion but in an abundance of caution we treated this unaccounted for laptop as a serious potential breach
1577200 the debtor cant possibly negotiate in good faith with us
1577201 were certainly seeing the velocity of leasing and new tenants to the market slowing down
1577202 each retailer depends on the presence of other retailers in the mall to generate traffic and create a shopping experience
1577203 denver as a whole is still in demand because we have these fundamentals that continue to grow
1577204 i dont know why for some reason theyre just sticking it to me this year
1577205 any time you get a chance to get manny ramirez you get him but from a personal standpoint its putting me in a tough position
1577206 if were winning and andruw starts hitting ill probably be back on the bench thats that power they went out and got in the off season
1577207 everybody personality wise on the team now seems to be in a better place
1577208 i think the consensus of opinion was that he wasnt given an adequate opportunity to prepare himself to come here
1577209 the guys been snake bitten somewhat because of a variety of things that have happened to him and i think everybodys very much aware of his history
1577210 its a very unique olympic games for me but im not that nervous i feel back home
1577211 its just a feeling im back home i dont have pressure on me
1577212 it gave people a lot of confidence to have a better life and connection with the world
1577213 mothers have thrown children at her so they can touch her
1577214 weve had occasions weve had to have bodyguards for her i dont think theres any parallels to that in the u s not michael jordan its extremely unique
1577215 i couldnt go anywhere as a chinese im pretty tall and i cant hide you cant go out in public
1577216 i thought volleyball is not too popular in the u s i can have a pretty normal life
1577217 the education of the u s players is very high and they seem to be very quick in terms of learning
1577218 i have to respect the way they think and in that respect we have to come up with a training program
1577219 the players set high goals for themselves and that impressed me the most

1577226 f r tibeter ist es usserst schwierig nach peking zu gehen und dort ihre meinung zu vertreten deshalb haben wir uns dazu entschlossen mithilfe dieses films den wahren gef hle der tibeter die noch in tibet leben nachzugehen
1577227 wir w ren eigentlich ziemlich gl cklich ber die olympischen spiele aber so vieles wird falsch dargestellt china hat die zusage f r die spiele unter der bedingung bekommen dass sich die situation in china und tibet verbessern w rde
1577228 aussenstehende denken vielleicht dass die tibeter gut behandelt werden und dass sie gl cklich sind in wirklichkeit aber ist es tibetern einfach nicht erlaubt von ihrer not zu erz hlen
1577229 auf jeden tibeter kommen hier zehn bis f nfzehn chinesen die chinesen sind berall in tibet
1577230 auch wenn ich mein leben opfern m sste damit der dalai lama diese botschaft sehen kann ergreife ich diese chance von ganzem herzen

1577232 zus tzlich zu dem verkauf von tankstellen in verschiedenen l ndern hatte omv ein gemeinschaftsraffinerie cost center modell vorgeschlagen um die zentralen bedenken der kommission in bezug auf eine konzentration von raffineriekapazit ten in der region zu ber cksichtigen
1577233 omv hat einen raffinerieverbund vorgeschlagen in dem einem unabh ngigen dritten ein teil der kapazit t zur verf gung gestellt worden w re verbunden mit corporate governance rechten die denjenigen von omv gleichwertig gewesen w ren
1577234 die eu hat die notwendigkeit einer gemeinsamen europ ischen energiepolitik betont und ihre unterst tzung f r die schaffung st rkerer europ ischer energieunternehmen zum ausdruck gebracht um so die versorgungssicherheit in der region zu gew hrleisten wesentliche ziele die wir mit dem vorgeschlagenen zusammenschluss mit mol verfolgt haben
1577235 wir sind von der sinnhaftigkeit einer strategischen allianz mit mol berzeugt ein zusammenschluss der beiden unternehmen h tte die energieversorgungssicherheit in der gesamten region deutlich verbessert und zwar sowohl durch eine breitere diversifikation in der roh lbeschaffung als auch durch den gr eren umfang des upstream bereichs der ein zus tzliches wachstum der gemeinsamen ressourcenbasis mit sich gebracht h tte
1577236 es ist ein grundprinzip von omv nur wertsteigernde transaktionen zu verfolgen und zu verwirklichen solange vern nftigerweise eine aussicht darauf bestand dass die transaktion unseren strengen kriterien f r eine wertsteigerung gerecht wird haben wir unser ziel weiter verfolgt nachdem die europ ische kommission angedeutet hat die von uns vorgeschlagenen abhilfema nahmen nicht zu akzeptieren ist der vorstand von omv zu dem ergebnis gelangt dass ein zusammenschluss die von uns angelegten ma st be nicht erf llt

1577243 our old reporting technology was inflexible there were just 18 reports and they werent extendable by end users
1577244 with views 8 we supply a suite of standard reports that can live in a users favorite interface using birt and e spreadsheets users can extend the base reports with any number of additional metrics
1577245 it was possible to do this before with views but it required lots of work

1577265 security was tight and was a bit over controlling which is par for the course at these events and as par for the course i tried to get near the candidate when i saw another reporter there alex leary security tried to throw me out but i found a mccain staffer i knew and the person vouched for me
1577266 race played absolutely no role in any actions taken by our employees or anybody else in this case
1577267 i definitely wish i was never singled out i came up there to do a story thats all i wanted to do is write a story
1577268 its the right thing for the mccain campaign to do
1577269 our issue remains with the secret service agent his actions are still a problem the senators campaign has done the right thing and we appreciate that

1577271 represents all that is good about the collective creative minds in the fandom
1577272 we got it at the right time with the runner in scoring position with one swing of the bat it could have gone either way and this time it went our way
1577273 coach blair has led our womens basketball program to the heights we knew he would reach upon his hiring five years ago
1577274 our first ever ncaa elite eight appearance in april exceeded expectations we could have only imagined before the hiring of coach blair and his staff
1577275 as a matter of fact it acted like the first foul ball the first fastball that he fouled off
1577276 it was at 90 mph or 91 mph so i know i overthrew it i missed my spot he got it
1577277 i didnt feel comfortable on the mound but in the last three innings i felt better
1577278 chris just got some balls up there in the seventh to give up those two base hits
1577279 other than that i thought he pitched well if he stays down hell be really good for us
1577280 we couldnt make some pitches there in the seventh and it came back to haunt us a little bit but we keep battling we had an outstanding day from an offensive standpoint
1577281 he claimed he had this problem before and he was back in a couple days but we dont feel like hes close right now as of right now i would say it doesnt look good
1577282 it didnt worry me but i knew where i stood
1577283 im not dumb i know hes a great pass rusher
1577284 last year all i did was drop in coverage and rush the passer and hes better at doing that than i am it just lets me know that im going to have to pick it up and make them find a way to keep me on this team
1577285 i think this new run scheme that we have in helps out a lot
1577286 we have less plays to worry about i think last year there were 10 to 15 running plays we had to worry about to each side this year its probably about five or six running out of a bunch of different looks but im focused on being more solid in that spot and being able to hold up
1577287 whether you call it a possession guy or whatever as long as i am keeping our offense on the field and putting ourselves in the position to score im happy with that
1577288 hes got a long way to go but hes progressing nicely
1577289 one of the reasons we liked duane coming out was his mentality
1577290 a we thought he could handle it and b he would not abuse it hes a very competitive guy and very serious minded you need both of those things hes not going to think hes got it made and hes not going to be overwhelmed by the situation
1577291 mario is a freakish athlete and he comes here every day ready to work
1577292 thats making both of us better im trying to show him some stuff and hes definitely showing me a lot of different things i think ill be ready for saturday
1577293 all im trying to do every day is get better with my technique
1577294 every day is a whirlwind ive got to find a way to keep everything under control to keep my head from spinning everybody here is a grade a athlete in college some games you can let up on people in the nfl youve got to be ready to go hard every play or youll get embarrassed
1577295 these are grown men out here who come to work to support their families
1577296 but its my job i need to come to work every day too i cant worry about the heat because its not going anywhere
1577297 alex is one of a kind a very unique guy
1577298 hes been doing this a long time with a lot of great players
1577299 he can be very frank but he definitely knows his stuff
1577300 i like his zone blocking system its not complicated and i did something like it in college
1577301 hell definitely play longer than the rest of the first group
1577302 he needs reps his playing time will be different from everyone elses
1577303 all the reps i can get ill take practice is one thing but going against guys youve never seen and dont know much about is a whole other deal
1577304 coming from college youre so used to playing and being out there the more you play the better you get so to speak
1577305 when i came in here last year for the first half of the season not only was i not playing i wasnt even dressing out
1577306 i think what happens with a young player is that you dont know how fast or intense it is in the nfl
1577307 i dont think darius knew the type of intensity level he had to push his game to after he was cut he had a chance to think about it
1577308 it taught me that when i do get an opportunity like i did last year i knew i had to take full advantage of it
1577309 he was a changed guy from the standpoint of intensity and actually having a sense of urgency that every play meant something to him
1577310 the value of being let go and not being with anybody really helped him he continues to grow and knows there is another level that he can reach
1577311 i think hes pushing them the teams other running backs very much so
1577312 hes a better player this year he really is his effort level is consistent its pro material now
1577313 hes never going to be a real speed guy but hes a pounder and what were doing right now offensively kind of suits his style hes probably caught the ball as good as any back weve had in camp
1577314 its definitely a challenge but im one of those individuals that is up for the challenge
1577315 a friend of mine was killed by lightning this year any of us could have gotten hit and i wasnt going to play again so i sprinted off the field
1577316 everybody was at risk everybody its not like it was just a slippery field and the players had a chance to get hurt everybody was at risk what if that had hit the stands
1577317 our job is to try to get the game in
1577318 you do the best you can do at the time i understand players dont want to be out there i dont want to be out there
1577319 there was no need to be out there when the lightning is that close
1577320 theres really only two options if youre out in something like that you either have never seen a lightning storm before or youre a complete idiot
1577321 i dont want to accuse the people that were hanging out in the stands and stuff of being idiots but i guess theyve never seen lightning well think about it people get killed by lightning strikes all the time its not likely to happen but its a heck of a lot more likely if youre standing outside in a lightning storm its one of those things where if a tragedy ends up happening its because people dont have respect for it nobody thats ever been struck by lightning probably thought theyd be struck by lightning
1577322 once berkman told me about biggios friend i was worried
1577323 look im back there with all that equipment out there
1577324 no matter what decision you make somebodys not going to be happy to me bell did an incredible job
1577325 im not trying to put in on cubs general manager jim hendry or anything like that but whoever is in charge of the cubs and their operations here if it was me when the tornado sirens went off the first time i would have immediately said were not playing this game
1577326 youve got reports of severe weather youve got to keep some perspective here
1577327 this is a baseball game and these games are important because teams are trying to make the playoffs and everybody understands that but at the same time dont lose your mind youve got tornado sirens going off and severe weather all over the place theres no reason for it theres no reason to put fans at risk theres no reason to put players at risk
1577328 you put umpires in a bad spot because everybodys like well its on them theyve got to make the call i mean theyre getting all kinds of pressure so i dont blame them
1577329 i think somebodys got to step up in a situation like that and say look yes we all want to win a world series here we all want to make the playoffs but there comes a point and time when youve got to just say stop i guess in our modern day of technology people say oh well the radar says this well im standing outside there and i can see the lightning hit the firehouse 100 yards behind the stadium so i dont need radar to tell me that
1577330 i forgot what a really great golf course this is
1577331 the last two holes are hard but fun its real eye appealing on 17 and 18 and that par 3 no 16 too
1577332 our biggest thing is conditioning and its a value for all golfers
1577333 last year we had our bunkers renovated and changed the design on a few and on the tee boxes we flattened some out
1577334 if you come out here not knowing it it could be a real difficult day for you
1577335 last year our theme was digging deep and we knew we had to dig deeper to legitimize ourselves as a program
1577336 and i think were there we know what it takes to win and we know how to work
1577337 there is unfinished business and it is to identify the path of what we need to finish
1577338 thats what were basically shooting for a winning season was fine and all and everything was good but we really just want to win the swac
1577339 no other team has a defense as good as ours
1577340 we say that if our offense could put up 21 points a game just 21 well win the game
1577341 we got better at the end of the season because people started to get confident they started to play better and they started to believe in the system
1577342 this year we have some incoming freshmen who have to learn some things but i believe that once we jell as an offensive unit its going to be hard for us to be stopped
1577343 thats a great accomplishment for our class coming and changing the program around
1577344 but we have to maintain what we did last year
1577345 i actually feel pretty good i dont feel too bad its hard to figure because im swinging at good pitches im just not making consistent contact like i was earlier this year
1577346 you dont see him struggle for long long periods of time you have not seen that berkman swing i know a lot of it is he just hasnt had time off
1577347 i guess im susceptible to these streaks in my career
1577348 im not sure why but its certainly one of those things that makes you scratch your head you cant go out there and try to hit the ball out of the ballpark you try to make good swings usually you run into droughts here and there but i havent done that in a while
1577349 obviously theres been injuries that have been very scary with people getting hit in the face with baseballs and stuff like that
1577350 as far as weather you have to consider this one the scariest
1577351 you dont think about that stuff when youre out there playing you dont think about how hard it is because once you start thinking about it and everything else youre immediately taking yourself out of the game because youre worried about slipping
1577352 im still a little sore but i felt better i took fly balls felt like i could move from side to side better
1577353 theres an adjustment period for someone coming from college to the nfl i wouldnt say last season was night and day or anything like that but
1577354 hes getting in a little bit better condition but hes still got a ways to go
1577355 he played as good as hes ever played for us last year
1577356 weve been pushing him to get the most out of him and he did play pretty darn well last year
1577357 but if he becomes a great player a pro bowl player then our football team is going to benefit from that so thats our job as coaches to keep pushing him and see if we can find that i think hes capable of it i think hes capable of being one hell of a player but his conditioning level has got to be the best its been and keeping him healthy is important and that is why were taking a different approach with him so well see
1577358 we saw how we got to eight wins last year
1577359 we know better how to work and how to finish games
1577360 there is still another level for travis to reach as a player if were going to go where we want to go
1577361 hes got to find another gear and weve got to work him to get that done
1577362 were still growing were still going to get better as each game goes on but i think tonight we learned something
1577363 being here is great but this wasnt the real show
1577364 it was like an audition for the olympics we passed the pre olympic test but now were going to go and take care of business
1577365 when i step on the line in beijing dont worry ill be ready to go
1577366 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games
1577367 whats the difference between spending your life trying to be invisible or pretending to be the person you think everyone wants you to be either way youre faking
1577368 there is no murkiness about what happened or who id it the really enormous mystery is jodi never leaves you guessing except for what is going on in the characters head
1577369 i think that sometimes when we dont want to talk about issues that arte hard to discuss or difficult to face its easier to digest it in fiction instead of nonfiction
1577370 and just when the reader thinks that the horror is over another shocking is unveiled
1577371 every kid in this school played a role jock brain beauty freak all peter had done was what they all secretly dreamed of be someone even for just
1577372 if you know nothing about jeffrey dahmer and want to know which crimes he committed and how he did it this is the book for you but if you have read other books about him dont bother although i believe that

1577376 as far as we know foreigners staged and gathered illegally and we express our strong opposition to that the olympic games is a grand sporting gathering and we will resist all attempts to politicise the olympics
1577377 we have laws regarding assembly and demonstrations and we hope that foreigners would respect the laws of china

1577386 a new era for solar power is approaching long derided as uneconomic it is gaining ground as technologies improve and the cost of traditional energy sources rises
1577387 solar power is a growing field and will meet a portion of our energy needs going forward that means solar power will displace some of the demand for fossil fuels
1577388 eight out of 10 respondents who had recently made consumer electronics purchases in a brick and mortar store said they had visited the stores website first according to a may 2008 nielsen online survey more than one half said they purchased from the retailer on whose website they had spent the most time

1577483 watkins glen has always been a so so track for me weve had decent runs but dont really have the solid finishes to show for it we had a good test at road atlanta a few weeks ago to prepare for this weekend were taking the same car we took to sonoma and i think the car was pretty good out there we just had some bad luck that day
1577484 every time the green flag falls on the starting field for a cup race at the glen everybody the competitors the fans at the track and all those dudes manning those tv cameras everyone involved knows to keep your eyes on turn 1 all you have to do is look back in the history books that single turn is almost legendary
1577485 you just need to have an open mind and follow some simple rules about road racing for me i try to do much of my braking in a straight line that gets the car slowed up enough to rotate through the corner for good power off
1577486 picking your passing points are important too if you focus the couple spots you can pass in that allows you to set people up and not force the issue in corners you cant pass in and i dont forget the importance of keeping our charter dodge on the racetrack you can get into a lot of trouble if you get off course at the glen you need to remember that slower is sometimes faster at these places
1577487 its a fun race track for us i really enjoy the road course at watkins glen i have a lot of fun there when we finish we finish well weve had some brake problems in the past and a transmission problem one year and thats why our finishes arent as good as our starting position its a place where it pays dividends to qualify up front start up front and have that track position
1577488 penske racing has a really good history at watkins glen and i personally like the place i have three poles there in nationwide and cup with both ryan and kurt busch and have won with both of them in nns qualifying is obviously very important but the real key to the glen is being able to get through the carousel to carry enough speed getting through the long sweeping corner and coming off if it to get a good run down the backchute the carousel turn one and getting through the esses are very important were not talking about points right now but the bottom line is that we have to kick scratch do whatever it takes to get in the chase were going no holds barred and taking all the chances we need to so we can win races and get in the chase
1577489 its going to feel great to get back behind the wheel of the no 45 marathon american spirit motor oil dodge terry labonte and chad mccumbee have both done an outstanding job over the last two months not only have they moved the team up two spots in owner points but theyve also helped advance the no 45 program this is a competitive car we need to continue that through the end of the year i had a blast in the tnt sports booth but im ready to get back on the track
1577490 in my indy car days watkins glen was always better to me than infineon raceway i am excited to return for my first sprint cup series race at the glen and am hopeful that we will have a strong run in the mobil 1 dodge
1577491 i am very excited about running at nashville this weekend stated john wes townley we had a successful test back in july and ive had several good runs in my late model at the music city motorplex across town hopefully some of that good karma will carry over to the speedway and i can bring home a guitar

1577493 the search appliance offers an easy plug and play solution that brings a lot of benefits
1577494 when you look at the raw math youve got three races and four rounds at each race so 12 rounds are up for grabs between now and when we roll out of indy
1577495 i think that it would have been something that i expected only because our expectation levels have always been high even starting with a new team our goal was to get into the top 10 and give ourselves a chance our goal was to win one or two races this year i think only because of the background of my family and the association with ford fords trust and belief in my family to be able to put together a team i think our expectations have always been very high i think we might have exceeded what some people around us expected where maybe they wouldnt think that we would come out as strong as we have i dont think that its surprised us as much as it has maybe other people because we have a very high expectation for this program both short term and long term now were not so na ve to make claim that were going to win a championship this year or for others to look out because we are humbled by the fact that we are in the midst of legends out there with huge resources and tons of data and experience that were building as we go along but at the same time we dont expect to roll into a race ever and not think we have a chance to win i can tell you one thing when we pull into a track and we set up and crew guys work more than 80 hours in a week our expectation level is that were there to win period then what happens well let the chips fall where they may but we have the parts to win the talent to win and i believe within the next couple of races were going to prove that to be the case
1577496 never did i ever question it we go to the races to win we have five cars capable of winning i felt like it was only a matter of time we should have done it earlier but you cant control some things in racing
1577497 it feels great weve been working so hard the last year and a half to get a win thats why we went into the grand am series because we felt like we could really compete and beat some of these big name teams for our team
1577498 we have a lot of work to do in the championship daytona and barber hurt us in the points so were kind of working our way back up our goal for the end of this season is to win as many of the remaining races as possible weve been there at barber and daytona and we were right up at the front in mexico and a bunch of the races this year we know that were going to be competitive at the glen and for the rest of the season so our goal is to keep trying to win each race
1577499 theres always room for improvement every race we keep fine tuning a little more and more we dont do any testing apart from the race weekend so obviously those are our test sessions every weekend we continue to fine tune and we get better with strategy and the whole team has been working together now for such a long time that its all coming together its not one thing its just a combination of everything coming together
1577500 ive got a lot of confidence there and ive driven a lot of laps its just a place you feel good when you go there its one of my favorite race tracks i think i like it better than i like sonoma just for the fact that its a little bit quicker and there seem to be more places to pass it seems to be a racier race track than sonoma of the two road races we do i think this is the better of the two ive enjoyed going there ive had some success there so im just looking forward to having a good run with the dlp toyota on sunday
1577501 one thing about toyota they definitely work very very hard to be successful on the race track this year is no different theyve got some wins this year in the sprint cup series and they will work very hard to get you what you want im excited id rather be in a toyota than any other car
1577502 ive got some good memories and some bad watkins glen was the race that cost me the imsa championship in 1993 in the esses there were a bunch of cars piled up and i stopped at the top of the esses and ended up getting a piece of bodywork from another car wedged under the bottom of my car and when i put it in reverse the transmission broke that was the one race that cost me the championship on the other hand we set the all time track record there on the nascar track with a sports car and it still holds today its a place where we have had a lot of success we won some races in the firestone firehawk series in a toyota there too
1577503 i think a guy whos good around watkins glen is good with the brakes youve got to be able to late brake and also carry a lot of momentum through the center of the corners and get off the corners quick i think thats the secret to being fast around watkins glen
1577504 i dont think its that big of a deal doing it at watkins glen last year i went there with another toyota team and we were fast right out of the gate and id only driven with the team at sonoma and done one test ive been doing one off road races like this for the past few years and just knowing what i want there it seems to be a place where we can adapt pretty quickly
1577505 its always cool to be a part of history when a j foyt was the first to win four indy 500s that was huge to imagine all the different types of racing thats been at watkins glen and know that weve got a shot to do something that hasnt been done before is definitely a cool opportunity
1577506 its definitely a place i feel like weve got the potential to win even before we make a single lap
1577507 ive just always liked it i won a national championship racing go karts on road courses so the concept of what it took to win races on road courses wasnt totally unknown to me but driving cars with suspension and definitely driving cars that you had to shift thats something that came relatively easy to me and still comes easy to me as far as knowing how to synchronize the gears without having to use the help of the clutch even in the sports cars that ive driven with guys who have driven road courses all their life ive gotten out of the car and the crew has torn the gearboxes apart and said that the dog rings in my transmission look better than when those guys are done with a transmission theres just something about the shifting side of it thats been really natural to me and its fun i like having a different discipline to race on i like having the opportunity to do something twice a year that we dont get a shot at doing very often i take the same amount of pride that someone like ron fellows or scott pruett does when they come into a road course race i take that same pride in running well that they do in these cars i dont look at it from the standpoint that its a negative weekend i look at it as a positive that its something we enjoy and i feel like that gives us a leg up on most of the guys we race with at these tracks
1577508 i always feel like were always a factor at both race tracks but if you look at the history it seems like if we dont win at sonoma then we normally will follow it up with a really good run at watkins glen i feel like you look at the records and you look over the last 10 years were definitely a factor were batting better than 400 at watkins glen in nine years weve won four races if you cant be counted as a factor after that i dont know when they do count you as a factor i feel that were the guys that every time we go there that everybody has to pay attention to us in order to win now there are times we dont win obviously but were still in the hunt every time and got a shot
1577509 i love the two road courses its nice because it kind of breaks up the monotony of the season we do the same thing every week and its nice to have two road course races thrown in the mix that give us a chance to do something a little bit off center for all of us its kind of like the prelude with no dirt added unless you drive off which a lot of us do we still get a dirt aspect in it i guess
1577510 you have to play the race strategy out its such a long track that guys dont go a lap down as easily as they do on an oval you have to run as hard as you have to in order to stay ahead of everybody and when you get yourself in a position where you can be easy on your equipment especially the tires you take that opportunity because if it is a long run a lot of times thatll work out in your favor if your cars not right you cant just keep pushing it or else youll drive the tires right off of it
1577511 i think we had a better battle at sonoma three years ago
1577512 theres mutual respect theres more to this racing thing than just winning races and trophies and prize money theres a day we all quit driving and its about the relationships you make along the way and youre going to have battles and rivalries with guys that are strong competitors with you and you know thats to be expected but at the same time theres a huge admiration and respect when you race guys like that too i think we both realize that
1577513 no not at all you look at guys who have run really well on the road courses the last couple of years and its jeff gordon myself and kevin harvick there hasnt been a road course ringer to win a race yet so i dont know why everybody uses that in the equation other than it gives them something different to write about you still have to beat the same guys that have been winning and all you have to do is look at the stats and the stats will tell you who youve got to beat there
1577514 the two tracks while both road courses are still pretty different at watkins glen you dont have to finesse the throttle near as much as you do at sonoma when you get the car turned you can get in the gas and then stay in the gas watkins glen is much faster than sonoma i think there are the same amounts of passing opportunities but because of the speeds that youre able to run at the glen brakes become a much bigger factor than i think they are at sonoma its pretty much a horsepower track its horsepower and aerodynamics just like it is anywhere else we go it just happens to be in the form of a road course sonoma has a lot less grip in the race track you have to really be careful with the throttle there and that puts more of the race in the drivers hands if anything sonoma is probably more technical than watkins glen because theres hardly any time where you get a chance to rest youre always either shifting or accelerating or braking or turning or doing something at watkins glen at least on the frontstretch and on the backstretch there are three straightaways where you get a little bit of time to take a break watkins glen seems to be more in the crews hands and the engine builders hands obviously theres still a job that i need to do in the race car but im relying on the equipment and the crew a lot more at watkins glen
1577515 i dont think weve put any more emphasis on the road courses than we have any other race but ive got a crew chief greg zipadelli who is very versatile and we have good people that work really hard to make the best road course cars we can its just the classic case of zippy and i working so well together that we can always get where we need to be he gets the car driving really good for me and he can make that car do what i want it to do then when im on the track im probably one of the most comfortable drivers on the race track and at that point i can go out and do the job i think a lot of it is due to zippy because he puts as much emphasis on the road course races as he does at indy or anywhere else even though there are only two road courses on the schedule it shows how dedicated zippy is as a crew chief to every discipline we race at
1577516 its not like were not running well because we are weve just had some circumstances that havent gone our way youll have that we tend to be a late blooming team anyhow we plan on doing the same thing we do every week were not changing our approach every week our goal is to win the race and thats not going to change thats how weve won two championships if we go out and win the race the points take care of themselves its always been that way and it always will be that way well try to go out and win the race each weekend and at the end of the day well look at the point standings and see where were at if we dont win well try to get as many points as possible
1577517 the first 26 races are really relevant except for how many wins youve got thats the only thing that those first 26 weeks count for and thats getting you the bonus points other than that as long as youre in the top 12 it doesnt matter whether youre first or 12th as long as youre in there thats what it takes to get you in the show and then you need to be good from there but its not a life or death situation if you have a bad day as long as after 26 races youre in that top 12 group if you have one bad race and it puts you 16 points out like it did us back in 2006 then it is bad it just depends on each individual teams scenario but were not sending the space shuttle to outer space with this format its pretty easy to figure out twelve guys get in and they have the same amount of points and the guys that won races gets 10 extra bonus points for every race they won its easy to do the math its easy for everybody to follow
1577518 im looking forward to returning to a road course this weekend
1577519 im looking forward to our return to road racing this weekend at watkins glen david gilliland showed that hes extremely good at it with our performance at sonoma back in june when he finished second our plan is to do the same thing we did at sonoma work on our track position from a strong qualifying effort and then just to keep the car on the race track during the race were bringing the same car we ran at sonoma with a couple tweaks to make it compatible with watkins glen hopefully david will be as happy with the car this weekend as he was at sonoma so that we can get the same results or even one better than we did there
1577520 we appreciate p j helping out the team this weekend at watkins glen
1577521 p j is an experienced road racer and we look forward to having a great run with him in the dlp toyota
1577522 im excited to be driving the dlp hdtv toyota for hall of fame racing
1577523 ive always enjoyed racing at watkins glen and look forward to having a successful weekend
1577524 this is our second road course event of the season and ive only had the opportunity to race at watkins glen once before watkins glen is quite a bit different from racing at sonoma because the glen has more high speed corners and we never get down to first gear because of that the pace of racing at the glen is a lot faster racing at sonoma is a bit slower pace and very technical where you strive to hit your marks and gain a rhythm im looking forward to this weekend since i havent been to watkins glen since 2005 ive had a few opportunities to practice my road racing skills over the past few weeks which allowed me to familiarize myself with the left and right turns again practice time on track will be important this weekend but i think it should be a great weekend for our hitachi power tools team
1577525 were bringing our car from sonoma to watkins glen for this weekend and im very confident that well have a great finish with our hitachi power tools ford travis kvapil performed well at sonoma in june and since that race hes had the opportunity to go to road atlanta and watkins glen for some open track times in order to practice his road course driving skills the keys to successful races at a track like watkins glen are to practice where all the turns are get a rhythm and to keep the car on the course all day long if we can accomplish all that well have a fantastic weekend

1577706 with the politics of energy shifting as rapidly as gasoline prices democrats led by presidential candidate barack obama are retreating from long held positions and scrambling to offer distressed voters more immediate relief from spiraling costs
1577707 sen barack obama altered his position on monday to call for tapping the nations strategic petroleum reserve to lower gasoline prices as he outlined an energy plan that contrasts with sen john mccains greater emphasis on expanded offshore drilling and coal and nuclear technology
1577708 sen barack obama called monday for using oil from the nations strategic reserves to lower gasoline prices the second time in less than a week that he has modified a position on energy issues as he and sen john mccain seek to find solutions to a topic that is increasingly dominating the presidential race
1577709 includes two significant reversals of positions he has taken in the past he had steadfastly fought the idea of limited new offshore drilling and was against tapping the nations emergency oil stockpile to relieve pump prices that have stubbornly hovered around 4 a gallon
1577710 one more week one more barack obama reversal on a key issue actually make that two reversals
1577711 we killed christ jesus the son of mary the apostle of god
1577712 when abraham was told by god to sacrifice his son his son did not object or question him if jesus was sent to be sacrificed for our sins why would he question god

1577715 the most reliable early manuscripts and other ancient witnesses do not have mark 16 9 20
1577716 for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one
1577717 this text concerning the heavenly witness is not contained in any greek manuscript which was written earlier than the fifteenth century it is not cited by any of the ecclesiastical writers not by any of early latin fathers even when the subjects upon which they treated would naturally have lead them to appeal to its authority it is therefore evidently spurious
1577718 men tend to see the physical as more of an experience
1577719 kissing and making out mean something very precious and deep to a woman

1577722 quite frankly i resent the implication that i am full of myself in fact i am half empty of myself because i am a pessimist and to fill the rest i seek meaningless sex excessive alcohol and the adoration of a whole bunch of people whom i will probably never meet except via the internet unless they come to an author signing

1577738 of course what kind of question is that who isnt
1577739 smile and the world smiles with you cry and you cry alone

1577742 um i think you should leave the jew hitler and holocaust references to those that actually had losses from those camps thank you
1577743 and yes saddam was killing off people like stalin killed off his countryside
1577744 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated
1577745 the issue of economics is something that ive really never understood as well as i should i suppose i ought to understand the basics the fundamentals the vision all that kind of stuff
1577746 bush has made mistakes but the dems are largely responsible for the current economic problems
1577747 the war in iraq is funded by oil money it will pay itself off
1577748 worse off of course if i were feeble minded and tottering off to old age like john boy id be spouting the same kind of incoherent babble mccain lives in a bubble and doesnt even have a clue what a gallon of gas costs let alone what the lives of ordinary men and women are like
1577749 how can you say we are wise and the law of the lord is with us but behold the false pen of the scribes
1577750 if you believe that jesus died on the cross for your sins and that he is your savior then you will go to heaven
1577751 many will say to me jesus on that day lord lord did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles then i will tell them plainly i never knew you away from me you evildoers
1577752 if a man is found sleeping with another mans wife both the man who slept with her and the woman must die
1577753 if a man commits adultery with another mans wife with the wife of his neighbor both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death
1577754 but a man who commits adultery lacks judgment whoever does so destroys himself
1577755 i tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for marital unfaithfulness and marries another woman commits adultery
1577756 anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her
1577757 and if she divorces her husband and marries another man she commits adultery
1577758 anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery
1577759 if your right eye causes you to sin gouge it out and throw it away it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell
1577760 if only you were to me like a brother who was nursed at my mothers breasts then if i found you outside i would kiss you and no one would despise me i would lead you and bring you to my mothers house she who has taught me i would give you spiced wine to drink the nectar of my pomegranates his left arm is under my head and his right arm embraces me

1577764 verse 1 appears to ascribe authorship to solomon solomon is referred to seven times and several verses speak of the king but whether he was the author remains an open question
1577765 two lovers solomon and a shulamite girl express their feelings for one another with occasional comments made by friends
1577766 1 then i looked and there before me was the lamb standing on mount zion and with him 144 000 who had his name and his fathers name written on their foreheads did not defile themselves with women for they kept themselves pure they follow the lamb wherever he goes they were purchased from among men and offered as first fruits to god and the lamb
1577767 1 after this i saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree
1577768 do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our god those who did not defile themselves with women according to revelation 14 4 4 then i heard the number of those who were sealed 144 000 from all the tribes of israel 5 from the tribe of judah 12 000 were sealed from the tribe of reuben 12 000 from the tribe of gad 12 000 6 from the tribe of asher 12 000 from the tribe of naphtali 12 000 from the tribe of manasseh 12 000 7 from the tribe of simeon 12 000 from the tribe of levi 12 000 from the tribe of issachar 12 000 8 from the tribe of zebulun 12 000 from the tribe of joseph 12 000 from the tribe of benjamin 12 000
1577769 four times the author identifies himself as john 1 1 4 9 22 8 in the third century however an african bishop named dionysius compared the language style and thought of the apocalypse revelation with that of the other writings of john and decided that
1577770 and will go out to deceive the nations in the
1577771 we support israel because it is gods promised land to the jews and he will prevail them against the army of gog and magog who seems to be mainly an islamic army today
1577772 then praise be to allah lord of the heavens and lord of the earth lord and cherisher of all the worlds to him be glory throughout the heavens and the earth and he is exalted in power full of wisdom
1577773 we allah are closer to the person than the jugular vein
1577774 the day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail but only he will prosper that brings to god a sound heart to the righteous the garden will be brought near and to those straying in evil the fire will be placed in full view
1577775 it is he who has created you humans and of you humans are some that are unbelievers and some that are believers and allah sees well all that ye do
1577776 o ye men it is ye that have need of allah but allah is the one free of all wants worthy of all praise if he so pleased he could blot you out and bring in a new creation nor is that difficult for allah
1577777 there is no time in which the son of adam does not remember allah almighty in it except that it will be a source of regret for him on the day of judgement
1577778 the people of paradise will not have any regrets except for those moments in which they were not engaged in the remembrance of allah almighty
1577779 that you continue to keep your tongue moist with the remembrance of allah until you die
1577780 such are among the signs of god he whom god guides is rightly guided but he whom god leaves to stray for him wilt thou find no protector to lead him to the right way
1577781 it comes in such a miraculous way that it creates a direct connection between allah almighty and the individual
1577782 allah has endeared the faith to you has made it beautiful in your hearts and he has made hateful to you unbelief wickedness and rebellion such indeed are those who walk in righteousness a grace and favour from allah and allah is full of knowledge and wisdom
1577783 for believers are those who when allah is mentioned feel a tremor in their hearts and when they hear his signs rehearsed find their faith strengthened and put all their trust in their lord
1577784 say the holy spirit has brought the revelation from thy lord in truth in order to strengthen those who believe and as a guide and glad tidings to muslims
1577785 it is he allah who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the believers that they may add faith to their faith for to allah belong the forces of the heavens and the earth and allah is full of knowledge and wisdom
1577786 in whatever business thou mayest be and whatever portion thou mayest be reciting from the quran and whatever deed ye mankind may be doing we are witnesses thereof when ye are deeply engrossed therein nor is hidden from thy lord so much as the weight of an atom on the earth or in heaven and not the least and not the greatest of these things but are recorded in a clear record
1577787 the unbelievers say never to us will come the hour say nay
1577788 say call upon other gods whom ye fancy besides god they have no power not the weight of an atom in the heavens or on earth no sort of share have they therein nor is any of them a helper to god
1577789 then shall anyone who has done an atoms weight of good see it and anyone who has done an atoms weight of evil shall see it

1577795 under the circumstances its hard to talk about what comes next
1577796 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1577797 irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises
1577798 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1577799 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide

1577819 while the first half of his foreign trip to afghanistan and iraq was official the european tour was campaign related yet it was on this leg that a visit to wounded u s soldiers had been scheduled as campaigning in a military hospital is prohibited the visit was canceled
1577820 thr e w all of his opponents off the ballot on a technicality so that those voters have no choice but to elect him this is precisely how he first won his state senate seat in 1996
1577821 so theyve done there what we need to do here we need to get our troops out of iraq and put them on the streets of america to protect us from the scourge of illegal immigrants who are running rampant across america killing our police for sport raping murdering like a scythe across america while the liberal psychos are telling us they come here to work
1577822 y ou turn on the cable news theyre covering again a missing child not a missing country but a missing child we hear about the rape of a woman but not about the rape of the statue of liberty the statue of liberty is crying shes been raped and disheveled raped and disheveled by illegal aliens

1577825 disclosing that tehran directed international a bomb inspectors to other places sources warned that the project poses a very serious threat to international security
1577826 the construction of the reactor began with the laying of a pipeline for fresh water from the nearby karoun river to the site and the expansion of the al zarqan power station
1577827 the construction works seem to be routine and do not arouse attention but the tight security around the region is what arouses suspicions regarding the nature of the work
1577828 from the irgc commander in the city of al ahwas to the director in charge at the mehab qudus company for construction and supervision mr mohammed kayafir
1577829 i thank you for the good services of the mehab qudus company and at the same time i must remind you of the following items
1577830 1 all construction materials must be transported from the warehouses to the construction site in top secrecy
1577831 2 as part of the doctrine of caution we reiterate yet again that during the transport of all required materials you must ensure that this transport does not arouse the suspicions of any citizen in the region through which you are moving
1577832 in conclusion we say yet again that all the construction work in this project must be carried out under absolute secrecy
1577833 from the aide to irgc commander in the city of al ahwaz hassan jalaliyan
1577834 national society for arabstan state took satellite pictures of the location which looked perfect for the construction of a secret nuclear reactor
1577835 the site is more suitable for building a nuclear reactor than bushehr which is close to american bases
1577836 al zarqan nuclear reactor is in the middle of very highly populated areas making it a very difficult target due to a possibility that the iranian authorities will use civilians as human shields
1577837 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and finance needs
1577838 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1577839 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1577840 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1577841 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1577842 to assume were going to pay for it all is just wrong
1577843 nonetheless the pace of spending has been held back by various factors including deficiencies in capacity and security
1577844 indians are a minority community in malaysia where they always become a victim of racist remarks and racial discrimination

1577846 my face was pushed into the ground my arm was twisted and i was hit two or three times in the face
1577847 this is utterly unacceptable any time its particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics at a time when china has promised complete media freedom
1577848 fulfill its olympic bid commitments to increase access to information and expand freedom of the press
1577849 the japanese reporters violated the rules of china by forcing their way into a military area the act was not well justified and they should accept the consequences
1577850 i however apologize to the reporters as the top regional public security official for the clash they had with the border policemen
1577851 before the last 10 years we would have never seen so many animals coming up in the gulf stream
1577852 we think its correlated with the generally warmer temperatures we are experiencing
1577853 some species may be moving further north because we are having milder winters secondly more fish may be surviving further north because winter temperatures are warmer
1577854 its essentially like carrying a bucket of water from florida to new york with everything thats in it
1577855 in september its not uncommon for us to get a hundred or more butterflyfish in one haul of the seine net
1577856 some days i go out and its like im in the caribbean
1577857 these animals arent going to make it through their first year if we go to the bahamas weve got to spread our collecting efforts out to not impact the breeding sites
1577858 kids adapt to new environments a lot better than adults fish are the same way when theyre young they feed better and get along with the other fish in the tank better
1577859 ooh get all the achievement points and blog about it

1577865 iran already stopped nuclear enrichment at the behest of europe for more than a year a reference to tehrans suspension of enrichment between late 2003 and mid 2005 to allow negotiations with the european union and what happened nothing
1577866 to place a verifiable cap on iranian enrichment and other nuclear capabilities well short of weaponization
1577867 the americans when they need the npt they talk about it when they dont need it they throw it away you dont do that with an international treaty
1577868 no evidence that iran was working actively to build nuclear weapons
1577869 with the shah we also came to the conclusion that iran was in great need of nuclear energy because our population was steadily growing and our gas and oil will run out thats why even though i was in the old regime i should be fair to the new regime because they are following the same line to speak frankly with its bellicose behavior the west is pushing iran towards nuclear weapons even if they don t want them now
1577870 the europeans say stop enrichment and well talk but the iranians already did that and nothing happened
1577871 at the time of the shah we signed contracts with both france and germany and even then they didnt deliver if i were in the current regime i wouldnt trust the west they dont even give iran civilian airplane parts which is costing hundreds of lives why should they believe that they will give them enriched uranium
1577872 for years now they are threatening us with an attack
1577873 these guys are ants when the time comes you crush them

1577877 there was a running interest in what effects peoples standing in the field of radio energy have and it could easily have been that somewhere in the many projects someone was trying to see if you could hypnotize somebody easier if he was standing in a radio beam
1577878 in this investigation it will be shown that the spoken word of the hypnotist may also be conveyed by modulated electromagnetic energy directly into the subconscious parts of the human brain i e without employing any technical devices for receiving or transcoding the messages and without the person exposed to such influence having a chance to control the information input consciously
1577879 biological effects of electromagnetic radiation radiowaves and microwaves eurasian communist countries
1577880 the above study is recommended reading material for those consumers who have an interest in the application of microwave energy to weapons

1577900 while the network outlook is bright our local stations are feeling the effects of a worsening economy the total local ad market was down 10 in the 4th quarter and pacings for q1 09 continue to be weak were starting to see some presidential political spending in several markets but spending in key categories like automotive and telecom financial services remains down
1577901 we need those stations to be the backbone of our network

1577906 many americans especially low income americans and seniors turn to over the air television to stay informed about current events and in the event of emergencies this bill provides assistance to those most affected by the transition and it brings us a step closer to ensuring that when we move from analog to digital broadcasting on february 17 of next year consumers will not be left in the dark
1577907 this is a very effective way to promote diversity of voices and increase competition in the telecommunications industry i support diversity in media ownership because it provides a window into communities languages views and values that might not otherwise be heard without these outlets
1577908 unfortunately we see major news outlets airing too many sensationalist stories on outlandish topics such as immigrants with leprosy black street gangs or mexican plots to re conquer the united states americans should be able to flip to stations where we can hear about asian american ceos revolutionizing their industries african american doctors saving lives and hispanic soldiers many of whom are not yet citizens bravely fighting overseas under the flag of the country theyre proud to call their own when we talk about minority run outlets were not just talking about broadcasters were talking about advocates advocates our communities depend on
1577909 its just not a fun time to be in business in the united states unless youre an exporter

1577917 no solo causa graves perjuicios a los pasajeros sino tambi n a las agencias de viajes y turoperadores sobre todo en el caso de paquetes y viajes combinados que deben reorganizar los viajes itinerarios y visitas previstas para cumplir con los servicios contratados por los clientes lo que en muchos casos supone un perjuicio econ mico irreparable

1577922 se han presentado reclamaciones correspondientes a 300 pasajeros afectados y a d a de hoy no hemos conseguido que se sancione a ninguna compa a a rea
1577923 hab a claras sospechas de que las compa as a reas jugaban la carta de las circunstancias extraordinarias con excesiva frecuencia para esquivar las compensaciones
1577924 la agencia de viajes tiene que estar siempre de parte del cliente e intentar que no se vea perjudicado
1577925 el cliente va a reclamar a la agencia y esta tiene que soportar en ocasiones su ira

1577930 i really didnt care but my lovely levelhead llh said that i had to be a mirror for a day so i decided why not however my llh couldnt make it because my llh had to go for a manicure so she can be the lovelier llh she really is so intelligent so i went there and i was like so apprehensive as to whether i should continue being a mirror because we had to have these disgusting blue tags i even tore one up because it looked so unglam however after the entire process i realised that being a mirror is a tough job and it was indeed great to serve the community even if it involves blue tags because serving the community is very important and is most definitely more important than tearing blue nametags because i can just shred them so theyre neat rectangles

1577940 i think its important to give all of us victims and the american people information that they can share and some appreciation of the overall state of the investigation
1577941 but i also think its important given the mistakes made in the past that they are not jumping to premature conclusions
1577942 all of us dont think he had anything to do with it
1577943 i just have to see what theyve got you work mostly with scientists and they say show me the data you look at what youve got make a decision and then act on it

1577974 he threw well but they centered some balls they hit two strike pitches and curves that he left over the plate that shouldnt have been there

1578021 benar benar menggelikan kemarin bisa menembus partai final dan kemudian sudah tersingkir di partai pertama di musim yang baru tapi memang begitulah hasilnya tak ada alasan untuk semua ini
1578022 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
1578023 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
1578024 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
1578025 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
1578026 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
1578027 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
1578028 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
1578029 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
1578030 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
1578031 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
1578032 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
1578033 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
1578034 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
1578035 i keep my own personality in a cupboard under the stairs at home so that no one else can see it or nick it
1578036 so what do you do on this space station anyway
1578037 take 5 minutes to here talk to this guy for 30 seconds then come all the way back
1578038 i keep my own personality in a cupboard under the stairs at home so that no one else can see it or nick it
1578039 vooral die aspe route is echt wel de moeite waard maar wel wat lang om op n namiddag te doen
1578040 het is al zo lang geleden dat we nog eens geweest zijn
1578041 breng mij zon sprookjesfiguur mee uit dat sprookjes bos voor in onze tuin
1578042 wij gaan alles organiseren aankopen en klaarmaken t is alleen te hopen dat het zondag iets droger blijft dan de weerman heeft voorspeld
1578043 we hebben een hele route uitgestippeld doorheen het heuvelland van de westhoek
1578044 en je wou toch altijd al eens die grote kerkhoven zien van de wereld oorlogen die komen we daar ook tegen
1578045 in de lakenhallen is er het flanders fields museum en ook een toeristen info bureau van daaruit willen we de flanders fields route volgen
1578046 dan weet ik niet of het wel waard is om er mijn leven voor te geven
1578047 we zullen droog zitten en die vuurpotten geven genoeg warmte af zodat het niet al te kil wordt
1578048 ik moet echt eens gaan leren dat jullie geen kinderen meer zijn
1578049 de dood van wauter heeft me overbeschermend gemaakt naar jou toe maar jij bent wauter niet jij bent bert
1578050 okee zeg me dan maar wat jullie willen voor aperitiefhapjes en wat ik kan doen
1578051 de zalm hebben we al en de toastjes ook een deel van de toastjes zouden we willen beleggen met zalm en witte kruidenkaas alleen weet ik niet goed welke kruidenkaas we hiervoor moeten gebruiken
1578052 misschien moet je maar eens op het internet gaan zoeken
1578053 this meant looking at open source solutions instead of platforms such as microsoft or sun we chose lamp linux apache mysql and php
1578054 i started from scratch it took me countless hours doing research on programming i really pushed myself to the limit
1578055 you nasty dirty freaks need to stay out of public amp weather you think it or not most of america doesnt want you here you are so quick to judge amp call people homophobes but these are just people who know right from wrong children dont need to be exposed to such trash mcdonalds is a family place not a queer bar you people take something that is meant to be a beautiful thing amp pervert it go to europe
1578056 i thought going into the last six races that we were going to win 10 or 11 rounds to have a shot at staying in the top 10
1578057 weve won five rounds so far in the last three races i still am kind of sticking to that concept i think were going to need a minimum of 10 round wins
1578058 i think if we can win brainerd well put ourselves in pretty good shape to stay in the top 10
1578059 maybe even more important we won the second race of the year and then we went into a slump for seven or eight races it seems like were coming out of that slump but the reality is youre never out of a slump until you win a race
1578060 if we can stay in the countdown i think it would send a message to all the guys who have been busting their butts on the valvoline mts dodge team that we really can contend for this championship were legitimate were here and there isnt any reason that we cant be mixing it up to be no
1578061 but i really think that were going to need to win one of these next three and id just as soon do it in brainerd and get it over with and then we can work on the other two
1578062 were looking forward to building on the indycar series tradition at infineon raceway
1578063 technology and innovation are key attributes of the indycar series and infineon raceway provides an ideal venue in northern california that is consistent with that branding and important to our continued growth and development
1578064 unfortunately some unforeseen land use issues and circumstances beyond our control have forced the cancellation of these rounds
1578065 we appreciate the commitment of the series competitors and have made this announcement as soon we could so that they can make other plans
1578066 iowa will be a challenging race with 50 cars on the track
1578067 we will need to be very conservative right until the end to make sure we can race the closing laps trg has been giving us great cars so hopefully duncan and i can ease through the st traffic and on to a win
1578068 these last few races have been less than optimal for us
1578069 we obviously have podium capable cars and drivers but racing luck has not been kind to us as of late we have been doing a ton of developmental and engineering r amp d and it has paid off in every aspect but finishing positions which is obviously the most pertinent and important i think that we are strong and we still have half the season in which to prove ourselves we are trg we dont do anything less than 110 percent and we will prove that in the remainder of the 2008 season
1578070 well its our one year anniversary since crew chief todd okuhara took over the helm of the mopar oakley dodge team
1578071 and were excited about that the brainerd race was todds first race with us last year we made it to the semifinals and had a real good shot at winning the race
1578072 getting into the countdown would be great but weve had a lot of fumbles this year weve had some chances to make some moves and nothing happened so were just going to do all we need to do and try to execute if it works great if it doesnt then its not meant to be
1578073 were going into brainerd with no pressure hopefully todd will make the right calls i will do my job driving and i know the mopar oakley dodge crew is always on top of things i dont worry about them at all well just see what happens
1578074 we had a fantastic two day test last month at virginia international raceway with a brand new car
1578075 andy and i use exactly the same seat so there will be no extra time needed when we make the driver change to add a seat insert we like the same car setup so there wont be any issues there either i cant wait to get at it andy is one of my racing heroes so im looking forward to driving with him again
1578076 i grew up in new york and have had a lot of success at watkins glen so i love racing there i only got to make one day of the test last month because of a scheduling conflict but everything seemed to go very well
1578077 neen hoor maar alle draadjes moeten bevestigd worden en er moeten nog wat tests gebeuren
1578078 oh dan ken je die en die ben jij daar naar school geweest ik ook maar ik herken je niet
1578079 precies op onze bbq dag gaat het regenen en stormen en koud zijn
1578080 ik denk dat het zelfs zou kunnen vriezen en sneeuwen
1578081 misschien moeten we maar wat straalkacheltjes voorzien voor in de party tent
1578082 dat zou wel handig zijn om onze drank koel te houden
1578083 i did not have sex with that woman miss lewinsky

1578090 mariah has been busy in the studio while her husband nick cannon has been filming for his t v series
1578091 so as soon as the pair get some free time i am sure they will be jetting out to their new pad to make up for lost time
1578092 i guarantee you that my contract will be like no other
1578093 it will be a ground breaking record contract for sure without a doubt theres so much money to be made right now in mixed martial arts and its all about the fighters trying to make that money its going to be a long term deal where i put my heart and soul into the company and help build them thats something im interested in doing theyre going to bring me on not just as a fighter but also doing some of the back work also
1578094 hes already been talking smack saying if he sees me hes going to kick my ass but right on if he keeps thinking that hell get his face caved in sooner or later i know frank shamrock is another person whos been opening up his mouth he beat me the last time we fought and i think that would be a great revenge fight where i kick his ass and finally shut him up as time goes well see who affliction signs besides me i dont know i might even go up to heavyweight if the bigger pay days are there
1578095 mr trump works fast and gets busy in a lot of the things he does and hes going to give me the best deal possible
1578096 i know they want to make some money and i know they got over 100 000 pay per view buys on their first show and with me its guaranteed to be over 500 000 pay per view buys just by the number of fans that are going to follow me no matter where i go so theyre going to get there moneys worth just in pay per view no matter what
1578097 while there are many complicated reasons why this is a disappointment mine is simple id like to finish saying goodbye
1578098 every launch attempt is like reliving his funeral theres a lot of pomp and ceremony and a retelling of his deeds in life but at the end of these funerals something goes awry the body doesnt get buried and you know youre going to have to come back to do it over again
1578099 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
1578100 because different types of perchlorate salts have interesting properties that may bear on the way things work on mars if and thats a big if the results from our two teaspoons of soil are representative of all of mars or at least a significant portion of the planet
1578101 the phoenix project has decided to take an unusual step
1578102 we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains of mars
1578103 right now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
1578104 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas we may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt that doesnt release chlorine gas upon heating
1578105 theres nothing in the tega data that contradicts mecas finding of perchlorates
1578106 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1578107 as a kid with my mom and sister i played a board game i believe is called sink the titanic it was ruined in a flood from hurricane ivan a few years ago you rolled dice to move your game piece shaped like a porter from the ship but if a 1 or a 6 is rolled the ship is moved a notch counter clockwise until the rescue ship does surface

1578129 if it wasnt for the decimation second third generations might still be here
1578130 their connection is with immigrants from the 60s and 70s
1578131 they dont have that last generation on taylor street to look to its more like two or three generations ago
1578132 i really wish those people from the third and fourth generations would come back to the neighborhood
1578133 the original neighborhood cant be recaptured its gone the people are gone but i wish people would come back to perpetuate and honor our ancestors
1578134 children and grandchildren of people who lived on taylor street come to be married where their grandparents were
1578135 we get an awful lot of people that have lived here and then moved away and always come back people are married here buried here baptized here
1578136 growing up we had family members there we would always go and visit
1578137 wed do the usual things getting marios frozen italian ice in the summertime when i got married i wanted to be close to the downtown area but i wanted something familiar i like that neighborhood feel
1578138 im third generation italian american and as generations continue i feel like were losing a little of our ancestry
1578139 it was looked down upon they tried to raise their children as american as possible its a different time i want to give my kids that culture

1578185 dua kelompok dari penduduk neraka yang aku belum melihatnya kelompok pertama yaitu wanita yang berpakaian pada hakekatnya ia telanjang merayu rayu dan menggoda kepala mereka seperti punuk onta melenggak lenggok membesarkan konde mereka tidak masuk surga dan tidak mendapatkan baunya dan kelompok kedua yaitu laki laki yang bersamanya cemeti seperti ekor sapi yang dengannya manusia saling rnemukul mukul sesama hamba allah syaikhul islam ibnu taimiyah rahimahullah berkata di dalam majmu al fatawa 22 146 dalam menafsirkan sabda nabi shalallahualaihi wassallam dia berpakaian tapi sebenarnya telanjang seperti w sehingga menggambarkan postur tubuh kewanitaan nya atau p seperti pinggul lengan dan yang sejenisnya akan tetapi pakaian wanita ialah apa yang menutupi tubuhnya tidak memperlihatkan bentuk tubuh serta kerangka anggota badannya karena bentuknya yang tebal dan lebar
1578186 maka hal yang membedakan antara pakaian laki laki dan pakaian perempuan dikembalikan pada pakaian yang sesuai bagi laki laki dan perempuan yaitu pakaian yang cocok sesuai dengan apa yang diperintahkan untuk lak laki dan perempuan para wanita diperintahkan untuk menutup dan menghalangi tanpa ada rasa tabarruj mempertontonkan dan memperlihatkan untuk itu tidak dianjurkan bagi wanita mengangkat suara di dalam adzan membaca talbiyah berdzikir ketika naik ke bukit shafa dan marwa dan tidaklah telanjang di dalam ihram seperti laki laki karena laki laki diperintahkan untuk membuka kepalanya dan tidak memakai pakaian yang melampaui batas dilarang yakni yang dibuat sesuai anggota badannya tidak memakai baju celana panjang dan kaos kaki
1578187 dan adapun wanita sesungguhnya tidak dilarang sesuatupun dari pakaian karena ia diperintahkan untuk menutupi dan menghijabi membalut dan tidak dianjurkan kebalikannya akan tetapi dilarang memakai kerudung dan memakai sarung tangan karena keduanya merupakan pakaian yang terbuat sesuai dengan bentuk tubuh dan tidak ada kebutuhan bagi wanita padanya
1578188 maka jelas antara pakaian laki laki dan perempuan itu sudah seharusnya berbeda

1578200 im comfortable playing an indian woman and in that sense malayalam films suited me the roles were not glamorous and there was no exposure involved it was not by design that i went to that industry to start with i guess i looked like a malayali but im a 100 per cent kannadiga though in kerala they will argue that im a palghat iyer i didnt want to do kannada films because i didnt want to be recognised in my city i wanted my space
1578201 i thought kerala was tucked away somewhere so no one will know if i act in those films i didnt know they were so accessible and reputed
1578202 since id already modelled and played mom i was comfortable but i was considered brave to do an amma role as my first but i thought it would be safe to do such a role because there wouldnt be any intimate scenes
1578203 i was scared to do films because i didnt want to be talked of cheaply now in hindsight i feel that was stupid you should be able to face what people say because people are going to talk anyway
1578204 if its a good director in any language the woman wont be reduced to a prop or bimbette maybe ive met more such directors there kerala tamil cinema doesnt have many roles for women its mostly of all young silly girls in love
1578205 i dont really like the small screen because the market is trp driven you need to add masala every friday to up ratings after a point my role became silly and negative
1578206 i wont do regressive roles and sometimes i mock myself for accepting the role of netra
1578207 housework is done by 8amish so that i can spend the rest of the day making memories
1578208 no you can not have the lunchbox you never even take your lunch to school so why would i spend ten bucks on a hannah lunchbox
1578209 awww mom i could put my pencils and stuff in it or my makeup if you let me buy some all the other fifth grade girls are wearing it ya know
1578210 isnt it crazy that we wouldnt even look at 95 percent of this stuff if it wasnt on clearance
1578211 like water which acquires the shape of the container its poured into i too effortlessly slip into any role and enjoy every bit of it
1578212 i always do my homework i study the background of a particular character nature behaviour relation to society and mannerisms before i act it out
1578213 a lot of these characters stay with me long after ive enacted them
1578214 when i am feeling low i watch a movie and soon i am back on track feeling as high as ever
1578215 no matter how hard one tries its the people who eventually decide the fate of every movie they are the best judges

1578245 i know i am not alone in this nagging sense of failing to measure up a feeling of not being good enough as a woman every woman ive ever met feels it something deeper than just the sense of failing at what she does an underlying gut feeling of failing at who she is i am not enough and i am too much at the same time not pretty enough not thin enough not kind enough not gracious enough not disciplined enough but too emotional too needy too sensitive too strong too opinionated too messy the result is shame the universal companion of women it haunts us nipping at our heels feeding on our deepest fear that we will end up abandoned and alone after all if we were better women whatever that means life wouldnt be so hard right we wouldnt have so many struggles there would be less sorrow in our hearts why is it so hard to create meaningful friendships and sustain them why do our days seem so unimportant filled not with romance and adventure but with duties and demands we feel unseen even by those who are closest to us we feel unsought that no one has the passion or the courage to pursue us to get past our messiness to find the woman deep inside and we feel uncertain uncertain what it even means to be a woman uncertain what it truly means to be feminine uncertain of whether we are or ever will be aware of our deep failings we pour contempt on our own hearts for wanting more oh we long for intimacy and for adventure we long to be the beauty of some great story but the desires set deep in our hearts seem like a luxury granted only to those women who get their acts together the message to the rest of us whether from a driven culture or a driven church is try harder

1578299 if we were not so bored and empty we would not have to stimulate ourselves with increasing dosages of sex and violence or just constant busyness here we are in the most fantastic fun and games factory ever invented modern technological society and we are bored like a spoiled rich kid in a mansion surrounded by a thousand expensive toys

1578302 signs and miracles are nothing of god without the faith and lifestyle of god
1578303 we are all like the clay buddha covered with a shell of hardness created out of fear and yet underneath each of us is a golden buddha a golden christ or a golden essence which is our real self somewhere along the way between the ages of two and nine we begin to cover up our golden essence our natural self much like the monk with the hammer and the chisel our task now is to discover our true essence once again
1578304 weve got a lot of people to give credit to
1578305 free agency to me is very new so im going to take it step by step but ive never hid the fact that i enjoy playing here in boston
1578306 i have great teammates a great manager great coaches so well see what happens but im more focused on celebrating right now
1578307 i was the throw in in the deal they needed josh beckett
1578308 they needed to get a top right handed pitcher and i dont think the red sox after the 05 season were like lowell has to be in that deal for us to take beckett im sure thats not the way they were going
1578309 model workers outstanding scientists technicians model teachers as well as entrepreneurs
1578310 youre kind of in the moment and youre playing and you have to concentrate on doing your job and make some plays
1578311 but now that its over yeah it was a great game one that would have been fun to watch but was even funner to play in
1578312 after the game we can appreciate a lot of the big plays that were out there
1578313 when we look at the highlights and look at the film well absorb it more well embrace it even more
1578314 and a couple of their guys have a lot of things they like to say chippy stuff
1578315 but it felt good for the tide to turn in our direction you get the w and you walk out of here with your head held high
1578316 it was probably the first game all year that we really had to play the entire game
1578317 youve got to credit the colts for that theyre a good football team for the guys to continue to make plays in the situation we were in builds character and the next time were in that situation it will be a little easier
1578318 if the colts are able to get after tom brady with their front four its going to be a difficult day for him
1578319 that will let them keep extra guys in coverage but if the patriots are able to pick up that pressure and the colts have to blitz brady will eat them alive
1578320 what they can do is truly unique a lot of those guys have been troublemakers for us up front but you have to concede a little bit of that they get paid too
1578321 i just felt in the second half we adjusted a little better to the speed of the game and we finished i felt as though they were getting tired there at the end i felt we were in better condition the line we showed up in the second half
1578322 the stress on that defense is over the middle and deep outside
1578323 we were picking our spots randy had a great release he got up on the safety alone on the guy and i just tried to throw it up to him
1578324 i thought it was very appropriate that he got the win its hard to come up with the right words
1578325 for us to come through and do what we thought we were capable of doing is unbelievable
1578326 our manager didnt panic the players didnt panic the coaches didnt panic we knew if we just kept playing the baseball that we know we can play well be all right
1578327 but this is 07 and we said that from day 1 and we accomplished our goal and its not easy to do
1578328 our goal is to get into the postseason as often as possible and win multiple world series
1578329 we used to say well anyone can win one a lot of people worked hard to make this happen
1578330 i know he doesnt hit or pitch or do any of those things anymore but i think he provides an atmosphere for our clubhouse and for our guys to be able to use our talents to the best of our abilities
1578331 a lot of things are being scrutinized a lot of things are being second guessed and he sticks with his guys all the time thats a very comforting feeling for a player and you want to win for him
1578332 i played for him before and after he was a genius
1578333 damn i wish there was somethin i could do to make you feel better
1578334 there were a bunch of things that didnt go the way we planned and a lot of thats great defense and some of its bad play by our best offense
1578335 youve got to pick a guy and let it fly
1578336 it was probably one of the most satisfying wins since ive been here
1578337 just the way it happened playing against a colts team who were undefeated themselves with you guys media hyping it up all week long it was fun to be a part of it we put our hard hats on today we didnt worry about the score at halftime we just said we were going to leave it all out on the football field
1578338 we answered the call and there was a lot of questions going into the game about our defense and everything else
1578339 but when you look at the whole picture of this game it was basically resilience and perserverance it was a gut check for all of us to see what we were going to do and the character of this team really stood out
1578340 we thought we were going to be in this ballgame until the clock stopped so we just pulled together we needed to and it showed
1578341 he gassed us and got to us hes a hard runner you got to give him credit
1578342 he keeps his feet moving he did a great job but we pulled together when we needed to pull together
1578343 out of 52 apartments every one of them has some damage

1578371 congratulations ross im not sure you realize the debt the seo industry owes you and the amazing seo shop youve built stepforth has consistently provided reliable and honest information to a sector that is in constant evolution one thousand posts later youre still at it i wish you several thousand more
1578372 of the posts you have contributed what post comes to mind as your fondest
1578373 over the last several years i have enjoyed contributing to the stepforth blog
1578374 what would you like to say about this auspicious milestone
1578375 its great to see that we have reached the 1000 mark for blog posts lately we have been putting much more effort into our news blog and its really starting to show having our resource reach this point with such a solid reader base is definitely make it an exciting milestone
1578376 in a year from now what do you think the stepforth blog will be writing about
1578377 as we move forward into 2009 and beyond i think the stepforth blog will only change in a minor way we will likely still have all the same tutorial type articles and latest search engine news but we will probably have more content on areas such as social media and analytics while we touch on these topics now they will likely take up more of the spotlight into the future

1578383 were doing reconnaissance and close air support work and operating 24 hours a day to look after the troops
1578384 weve done a lot since weve been here its been a pretty heavy task for the squadron to support
1578385 its a very quick way for the jtac to assess the situation to see whether somebody is going to attack them or for what we may think is an ied or a road block
1578386 we can also record that imagery and bring it back
1578387 yesterday i arrived in theater and was immediately re tasked so everything must be flexible and thats what makes the mission interesting
1578388 we were launched to do a planned close air support tasking in support of troops who were doing a search and within minutes we were off to another area
1578389 its a 12 hour day at a minimum for us
1578390 were sending up guys during the night as well as during the day so its a constant workload for the squadron here and our engineers to maintain these aircraft
1578391 that way we dont have one crew working 12 hours in the hot sun
1578392 we changed 14 engines in the first five weeks of us being here
1578393 we constantly have to do preventive maintenance on these aircraft
1578394 when we get caught up with our work it gives us an opportunity to train maintainers in other aspects of the plane
1578395 we are continually making improvements in the way we do things the added skills will prove extremely useful when the raf begins supporting the afghanistan theater next year the challenges will be different but we have a great group of guys

1578410 show how it is possible to determine the height of a tall building with the aid of a barometer
1578411 take the barometer to the top of the building attach a long rope to it lower it to the street and then bring it up measuring the length of the rope the length of the rope is the height of the building
1578412 take the barometer to the top of the building and lean over the edge of the roof drop the barometer timing its fall with a stopwatch then using the formula x 0 5 a t 2 calculate the height of the building
1578413 there are many ways of getting the height of a tall building with the aid of a barometer for example you could take the barometer out on a sunny day and measure the height of the barometer the length of its shadow and the length of the shadow of the building and by the use of simple proportion determine the height of the building
1578414 there is a very basic measurement method you will like in this method you take the barometer and begin to walk up the stairs as you climb the stairs you mark off the length of the barometer along the wall you then count the number of marks and his will give you the height of the building in barometer units
1578415 of course if you want a more sophisticated method you can tie the barometer to the end of a string swing it as a pendulum and determine the value of g gravity at the street level and at the top of the building from the difference between the two values of g the height of the building in principle can be calculated
1578416 on this same tack you could take the barometer to the top of the building attach a long rope to it lower it to just above the street and then swing it as a pendulum you could then calculate the height of the building by the period of the precession
1578417 is to take the barometer to the basement and knock on the superintendents door when the superintendent answers you speak to him as follows mr superintendent here is a fine barometer if you will tell me the height of the building i will give you this barometer

1578429 do you think that the filmmakers achieved a balance between their effort to make a convincing argument and their effort to offer multiple points of view

1578433 the sheer gluttony of information hurled in our direction during the less than two hour duration of the film is dizzying even upon multiple viewings these are complex questions with complex answers
1578434 we must help make this heaven even if it is not
1578435 no matter what side youre on look these people are very real americans
1578436 gosh those people are american what was i thinking from now on im not going to be tempted to shoot anymore sikhs
1578437 the film makes no judgement on political grounds only moral grounds
1578438 craig fought his utmost like he always has done but this was one battle he just couldnt win

1578441 we keep thinking hes going to walk through the door or there will be a phone call saying its a mistake but it isnt
1578442 for his mum she always worried about the dark side of the sport i never did you think it will never happen to you
1578443 at three his mum bought him a pw50 yamaha motorcross bike and we played around the fields that backed onto the house
1578444 i took him to race meetings because i used to do grass track racing myself but it wasnt for him and i never pushed him
1578445 then in 1995 he went on to race mini motos and that was it he was hooked
1578446 at seven years old he could ride the yamaha like a speedway rider

1578452 if i stopped my website id probably sleep for three weeks theres a lot of stress that goes into maintaining a website every day if i miss a day of blogging people email me or post comments as if how dare you for missing a day sometimes it makes me think walk away woman walk away
1578453 i write for tv have written memories and books but its not the same feedback as getting feedback right away from your community i need to get it out there particularly to people who dont know you personally its great to get feedback from people other than your close friends or your husband
1578454 why not delete comments that are hateful most of them are made up and not true why give them that kind of power
1578455 people want to report me to child services because i did x or y with my daughter this is what goes on behind the scenes everyone thinks its glamorous they think oh she gets up blogs every day in her pajamas and gets to stay at home with her husband behind the scenes people are threatening to take my child away theyre threatening bodily harm to me i have to deal with hate mail and hate comments
1578456 i do have the power i just delete it or if i think a comment could bring about an interesting discussion ill leave it up
1578457 how often is there a correlation between when you express yourself really well and negative comments are you surprised which posts generate more commentary
1578458 dont give too much authority to the amount of comments on your blog you never know how one thing you write will affect a person you shouldnt let one or two negative comments impact you one way or the other some people dont comment at all and email you instead or simply dont engage
1578459 what makes people go back to your blog again and again your interests
1578460 what i write about depends on what im interested in on a particular day
1578461 when i go back to a tv show or blog its about the characters i go back again if theres a tug at me around a particular character i read about or see
1578462 when you write about women and care about women it can be threatening to our culture were pushing the envelope and as a result were going to get hate mail death threats etc so we really need to support each other
1578463 blogging gives us a voice and sometimes its a voice we dont particularly dont want to hear if someone is writing about a child and making money off writing about her child shell likely get hate mail and make people upset if someone is doing the same thing on a tv show book etc youre not going to hear as much backlash about it there as you would on a blog blogging is more accessible and available to people

1578470 ahhhhh yes i remember you you were not sick i was the one who was sick
1578471 i had to stop to throw up and you brought me back to my family you were with friends from near auckland
1578472 i drove them around on and off for a few days before i dropped you off he gave me some homemade something and vodka it was a hot day no wonder poor gopen got sick gopen who i later learn also is a manager of the yacht club
1578473 when we got to the airport we ate them before you got on the plane
1578474 you sent me a bag of stuffed animals for the children
1578475 after 30 years in government serving under five presidents of both parties and chairing two non partisan commissions on the public service i have been reluctant to engage in political campaigns the time has come to overcome that reluctance however it is not the current turmoil in markets or the economic uncertainties that have impelled my decision rather it is the breadth and depth of challenges that face our nation at home and abroad those challenges demand a new leadership and a fresh approach it is only barack obama in his person in his ideas in his ability to understand and to articulate both our needs and our hopes that provide the potential for strong and fresh leadership that leadership must begin here in america but it can also restore needed confidence in our vision our strength and our purposes right around the world
1578476 weve all been walking the train tracks just like they did all our lives
1578477 this was part of the impetus for the anti gang programs in houston
1578478 i think the focus should stay on whether or not the current policy does anything to any way compromise or diminish the level of service we provide for all harris county
1578479 this is not something i wish to war over its really just she wishes to do something and i think she can do it without stopping the whole program
1578480 its really just she wishes to do something and i think she can do it without stopping the whole program
1578481 i think the focus should stay on whether or not the current policy does anything to any way compromise or diminish the level of service we provide for all harris county
1578482 just because were having a study i dont think it means we have to say were going to totally shut down the expansion of the program
1578483 urs used that knowledge in a competitive bidding process to provide the best value for wcs
1578484 we think the underlying geology has not been adequately studied and therefore confirmed as being safe for the disposal of this type of waste
1578485 the landfills will have similar designs with disposal in the sites almost impenetrable red bed claystones
1578486 we will be pleased to work with the harris county sports and convention corp astrodome redevelopment co and the rodeo in an effort to finalize agreements that protect the rights of all parties and allow for the successful redevelopment of the reliant astrodome
1578487 last time we were looking at a business proposal that violated our rights all over the place now a lease is being developed to protect our rights
1578488 the commercial lending market is much tougher now quite frankly we have been waiting on getting an approved lease before we go back out into the marketplace
1578489 were glad and pleased that the comments have been forthcoming on the lease we are trying to work things out with the rodeo and texans and the county
1578490 it really looks like the track of edouard is heading right to that section
1578491 as long as we could have some good consistent rain that would really help us out this could be a wonderful thing if we do not receive high winds or flooding in the area
1578492 they couldnt push vouchers through the legislature in an above board way so they went through the back door to divert public dollars to private school programs even though lawmakers warned them not to do so
1578493 we need to be marshalling all our forces to respond to it
1578494 its incredible that tsta thinks that nonprofit organizations dont have a role to play in reducing the dropout problem and increasing the graduation rate
1578495 the reason vouchers are objectionable is not because they give money to parents rather because they are using public money to fund private organizations who can pick and choose who they want to serve on any basis or on no basis whatsoever
1578496 ive never seen a hurricane so if this is it im really disappointed
1578497 for us it was just a chance to spend more time in a coffee shop
1578498 i guess they need to give you a welcome to houston hurricane packet
1578499 my goal today was to get as wet as possible
1578500 we might go to 11th street cafe and then probably just go jump in my pool afterwards just for icing on the cake
1578501 you can go running around in the rain as long as you want
1578502 and then we can go driving around in the rain
1578503 shes pregnant so as much extra sleep as she can get she takes

1578507 it all depends on whether you can raise the money and the cost of steel tomorrow or a year from now
1578508 when your offices are not on site and you have specific details to take care of its tough operationally
1578509 the companies with the largest budgets either have them or are well on the way
1578510 it makes the relationship between administration and production a lot easier
1578511 one thing led to another and thats when mrs osteen assaulted continental flight attendant sharon brown
1578512 she threw her against the lavatory door and she elbowed her in her breast
1578513 the flight attendant went bonkers she flipped out acted rashly and now wants to be paid for it
1578514 and they left on their own law enforcement was never involved
1578515 a blob is a binary large object that can hold a variable amount of data the four blob types tinyblob blob mediumblob and longblob differ only in the maximum length of the values they can hold
1578516 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1578517 under the circumstances its hard to talk about what comes next
1578518 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1578519 irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises

1578526 we will put him into the mix with everybody else i am not sure how much he will be ready for on thursday we will just have to see
1578527 i like to think i write self documenting code so i tend to not have any comments in my code
1578528 in order to provide congress with the time needed to consider this situation
1578529 establish binding rules of decision that pre empt contrary state law
1578530 the executives narrow and strictly limited authority to settle international claims disputes pursuant to an executive agreement cannot stretch so far as to support the current presidential memorandum
1578531 the united states will discharge its international obligations by having state courts give effect to the decision in accordance with general principles of comity in cases filed by the 51 mexican nationals addressed in that decision
1578532 our relationship is important vital and i believe it is strong
1578533 the north koreans have 11 000 artillery tubes and rockets aimed at the south korean capital so any little thing that we do with north korea makes the south koreans very jittery
1578534 on the other hand the u s has to worry a great deal about where terrorists might get nuclear weapons or nuclear material

1578547 kelly is in the business of taking care of people and now she is in a spot where she needs people
1578548 i thought it was absolutely wonderful and delicious that the dnc would use more suvs than i would
1578549 this is terrific seeing as how this is supposed to be the greenest convention around its just wonderful to see that theyre driving yukons around
1578550 as long as theyre carrying on the spirit of ruining the environment thats good enough for me
1578551 now that i know theyre driving around in avalanches i might actually consider voting democrat
1578552 when i step on the line in beijing dont worry ill be ready to go
1578553 quatre trangers se sont rassembl s ill galement nous condamnons vigoureusement cette action
1578554 we cannot be fooled by a government that is pushing through a contraband reform
1578555 when the government acts as it has now without respecting the constitution and the word of the president is the law then an act of tyranny is being committed
1578556 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1578557 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1578558 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1578559 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
1578560 the overwhelming majority of studies that have been published in scientific journals around the globe show that wireless phones do not pose a health risk
1578561 the most difficult thing to resolve is whether there is an effect with long term mobile phone use
1578562 its time for the interphone to come out its a public health issue
1578563 were telling our employees that using videoconferencing is beneficial not just for the environment but also for life balance
1578564 top management who fly a lot recognize that spending your life in airports can be really horrible

1578573 mickey was very close to all members of his family and will be greatly missed by his mum and dad brothers and sisters aunties and uncles cousins nephews and nieces and his grandparents
1578574 mickey loved life and had many friends he was popular and well liked mickey was the life and soul of the party a happy and outgoing 18 year old man mickey was definitely a peoples person our world will never been the same without him
1578575 people are angry and upset obviously we want to talk about this case because we want people to know that it has happened
1578576 theres a pent up demand from people on the right side of the aisle who feel that the mainstream media is effusively covering barack obama and not critically covering him
1578577 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
1578578 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
1578579 fleeced how barack obama media mockery of terrorist threats liberals who want to kill talk radio the do nothing congress companies that help iran and washington lobbyists for foreign governments are scamming us and what to do about it
1578580 with books like these the minute some people know theyre out there they must have them
1578581 the anti obama readership is largely one that has already made up its mind and is looking for validation while the obama readership comprises both those who have already made up their minds and those who are curious about him
1578582 a fake twitter profile w malicious payload has been spotted by security firm kaspersky
1578583 zus tzlich zu dem verkauf von tankstellen in verschiedenen l ndern hatte omv ein gemeinschaftsraffinerie cost center modell vorgeschlagen um die zentralen bedenken der kommission in bezug auf eine konzentration von raffineriekapazit ten in der region zu ber cksichtigen
1578584 omv hat einen raffinerieverbund vorgeschlagen in dem einem unabh ngigen dritten ein teil der kapazit t zur verf gung gestellt worden w re verbunden mit corporate governance rechten die denjenigen von omv gleichwertig gewesen w ren
1578585 die eu hat die notwendigkeit einer gemeinsamen europ ischen energiepolitik betont und ihre unterst tzung f r die schaffung st rkerer europ ischer energieunternehmen zum ausdruck gebracht um so die versorgungssicherheit in der region zu gew hrleisten wesentliche ziele die wir mit dem vorgeschlagenen zusammenschluss mit mol verfolgt haben
1578586 wir sind von der sinnhaftigkeit einer strategischen allianz mit mol berzeugt ein zusammenschluss der beiden unternehmen h tte die energieversorgungssicherheit in der gesamten region deutlich verbessert und zwar sowohl durch eine breitere diversifikation in der roh lbeschaffung als auch durch den gr eren umfang des upstream bereichs der ein zus tzliches wachstum der gemeinsamen ressourcenbasis mit sich gebracht h tte
1578587 es ist ein grundprinzip von omv nur wertsteigernde transaktionen zu verfolgen und zu verwirklichen solange vern nftigerweise eine aussicht darauf bestand dass die transaktion unseren strengen kriterien f r eine wertsteigerung gerecht wird haben wir unser ziel weiter verfolgt nachdem die europ ische kommission angedeutet hat die von uns vorgeschlagenen abhilfema nahmen nicht zu akzeptieren ist der vorstand von omv zu dem ergebnis gelangt dass ein zusammenschluss die von uns angelegten ma st be nicht erf llt
1578588 we achieved highly encouraging second quarter organic sales growth despite a difficult economic environment still characterized by significantly increasing raw material costs and a weak us dollar
1578589 our organic growth was supported by all our business sectors the improvements were primarily from our growth regions while development in western europe was restrained we were able to further increase adjusted operating profit the integration of the national starch businesses which brought us a significant boost in sales and the implementation of our efficiency enhancement program aligned to achieving a sustainable improvement in our competitiveness continue on track with good progress being achieved despite the challenging environment we are confident regarding the development in the further course of the year
1578590 in einem schwierigen wirtschaftlichen umfeld das weiterhin durch stark steigende rohstoffpreise und einen schwachen us dollar gekennzeichnet war erreichten wir ein sehr erfreuliches organisches umsatzwachstum
1578591 das organische wachstum wurde von allen unternehmensbereichen getragen es stammt insbesondere aus unseren wachstumsregionen w hrend die entwicklung in westeuropa verhalten war das bereinigte betriebliche ergebnis konnten wir weiter steigern die integration der national starch gesch fte die uns einen deutlichen umsatzschub brachten und die umsetzung des effizienzsteigerungsprogramms zur nachhaltigen verbesserung unserer wettbewerbsf higkeit verliefen planm ig trotz der schwierigen rahmenbedingungen sehen wir der entwicklung im weiteren jahresverlauf zuversichtlich entgegen
1578592 in addition to the sale of retail stations in various countries omv had proposed a shared refinery cost center model to address the commission s principal concerns regarding the concentration of refining capacity across the region
1578593 omv proposed the creation of a refinery centre in which an independent third party could have held a capacity share with a share in corporate governance equal to omv
1578594 the eu has stated the need for a common european energy policy and to support a policy of creating stronger european energy companies to ensure the security of supply for the region fundamental objectives for our proposed combination with mol
1578595 we strongly believe in our original rationale for a strategic alliance with mol the combination of both companies would have significantly enhanced the security of energy supply throughout the region through both greater diversification of crude oil supply as well as the greater scale in upstream to generate additional growth of the combined resource base
1578596 omv has a core principle to only follow and implement value accretive deals we pursued our goal as long as there was a reasonable chance that such a transaction would meet our disciplined criteria for value generation given the indication from the european commission that it would not accept our remedy proposal omv s board has concluded that such a merger would not fulfil our standards
1578597 i think that voters have said that thats not what theyre interested in anymore
1578598 i think we went straight to the voters and had a lot of voter contact
1578599 im looking forward to having everybody pull together around judy
1578600 we just worked really hard now well continue to work really hard and continue to take nothing for granted just like we have been doing
1578601 this job does mean a lot to me and the clients of connie hendren are really important to me
1578602 i ran an honest race and i think im the best candidate
1578603 f r tibeter ist es usserst schwierig nach peking zu gehen und dort ihre meinung zu vertreten deshalb haben wir uns dazu entschlossen mithilfe dieses films den wahren gef hle der tibeter die noch in tibet leben nachzugehen
1578604 wir w ren eigentlich ziemlich gl cklich ber die olympischen spiele aber so vieles wird falsch dargestellt china hat die zusage f r die spiele unter der bedingung bekommen dass sich die situation in china und tibet verbessern w rde
1578605 aussenstehende denken vielleicht dass die tibeter gut behandelt werden und dass sie gl cklich sind in wirklichkeit aber ist es tibetern einfach nicht erlaubt von ihrer not zu erz hlen
1578606 auf jeden tibeter kommen hier zehn bis f nfzehn chinesen die chinesen sind berall in tibet
1578607 auch wenn ich mein leben opfern m sste damit der dalai lama diese botschaft sehen kann ergreife ich diese chance von ganzem herzen
1578608 sagten dass wir ihre gesichter unbedingt zeigen m ssten da es sonst nicht der m he wert w re mit ihnen zu sprechen
1578609 all my supporters and all and the people who went out there and voted today
1578610 weve gotten people to realize what the assessors role is how to do appeals how to check out on the web site i really think weve done a good thing
1578611 i think theres been more hits on the assessors web site than ever before
1578612 i want to thank the people of boone county who voted for me
1578613 and to the people who didnt im interested to hear their ideas for what they think the commission should work on
1578614 my door is always open my cell phone is on my voicemail and my e mail is on the web site i am interested
1578615 i look forward to working on the economic effort i made my platform
1578616 that was my goal hopefully people will be able to measure me by it
1578617 when youre kind of new you dont have the credibility with voters that comes with a well known name
1578618 im ready to take this campaign to all four corners of this state
1578619 im just excited to get back out on the streets to continue campaigning
1578620 i dont have scores to settle or axes to grind
1578621 when this race started there werent two people that thought it could be done there was one person who thought it could be done and it wasnt me
1578622 if he werent working on this race i wouldnt be representing the 23rd district its as simple as that
1578623 i think we ran a great campaign and i am very happy with what we did
1578624 i thought it was a great race and well just have to look ahead to november now
1578625 this is going to be a big couple of years for missouri
1578626 thank you all for your support im going to work hard to represent you and this district
1578627 people remembered i came to their house and thats what they said over and over at the polls
1578628 we ran a great race i really cant stress enough how great the process was going door to door meeting people and getting groups to sign on in a district of this size you see how important that is
1578629 ive spent every day for the last seven months talking with people about important issues what could be better than that
1578630 im very disappointed but at the same time it was an opportunity
1578631 i spoke with mary she was conciliatory and gracious and maybe we can work together in some way in the future i met a lot of people i wouldnt have if i hadnt run
1578632 all persons shall have full and free liberty of religious opinion nor shall any be compelled to frequent or maintain any religious institution
1578633 no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship
1578634 shall be free to profess their opinion in matters of religion
1578635 for my neighbor to say that there are twenty gods or no god it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg
1578636 if things dont turn out the way we want life goes on
1578637 i have no regrets we worked as hard as we possibly could have and im proud of our effort for my immediate plan i have an 11 month old little girl and ive missed out on a lot of her first year ive got a lot of making up to do
1578638 the product weve put on the field for the last 30 years has been pretty good what ive liked is the execution by our young men and the way they conduct themselves on the field and after the games
1578639 thats my goal that people will say its the same ol dayton team

1578714 however the main impact on the market is in the volume of transactions which have been more than halved over the year
1578715 while a correction in the market is taking place it is important to stress that price levels have not collapsed and the marking down of prices appears to be incremental rather than a one off correction
1578716 for instance there are different factors affecting both the resale and the new build markets
1578717 with a very quiet resale market i believe there is a high probability of the average price dropping closer to the 200 000 level before the end of year with a period of adjustment stretching into 2009
1578718 anyone looking for the green shoots of recovery should keep an eye on transaction levels which are likely to turn before prices do but it might be a while

1578730 between 50 and 100 people from the camp will carry out direct action against an agro fuels firm somewhere in kent on wednesday
1578731 i cant tell you any times but i would advise you to get up early and listen to the news on the radio
1578732 we have found in recent years that agro fuels have been pushed by the government and corporations as a green solution to climate change
1578733 in fact they greatly worsen climate change studies have shown that carbon emissions from agro fuels will take decades to repay the carbon debt they create
1578734 cargill is using the boom in agro fuels to expand soya palm oil and sugar plantations displacing communities food crops and destroying ecosystems
1578735 destroying rainforests and other biodiverse ecosystems including healthy soils is one of the quickest ways of heating the planet
1578736 you know how sometimes you want to hate something but just cant
1578737 i wish i could eat there every night all so simple and so perfect like eating in europe where everything tastes like what it is have pics but we devoured the crostini with house cured pancetta and herb butter before i got a shot
1578738 dense and i learnt a lot because it was earthed in real experience and very hands on
1578739 very practical and valuable advice for dealing with the media
1578740 lots of information relaxed environment interactive scary but fun and great learning environment
1578741 very relevant although challenging it was really valuable to do the radio and then the tv it showed the benefits of being prepared
1578742 refreshing to move away from the lecture style presentation the more practical the better very good relevant information
1578743 openness the ease of style depth of obvious knowledge correctness absolute professionalism thankyou tom i really enjoyed learning with you
1578744 the radio interviews i think they were very helpful the feedback throughout the day was also helpful
1578745 keeping it real relevant and relaxed and the power of 3
1578746 relaxed encouraging insightful build up a great base on how the media is run
1578747 clear and easy to understand good practical examples from toms own experiences
1578748 it was a joy to read this excellent and useful book it presents us with the basics of the history of calvinism and confessionalism as well as the mainstream calvinistic teaching on salvation piety growth the church preaching evangelism marriage family work politics ethics doxology and more
1578749 there seems to be a popular misconception afoot that calvinism is an impressive intellectual structure but that reformed people must find resources elsewhere for practical piety at the heart of joel beekes ministry has been a burden to show the opposite conclusion the book is written in a warm pastoral and engaging way
1578750 living for gods glory is a very helpful and insightful introduction to reformed christianity it demonstrates that calvinism is not narrowly doctrinal but broad and profound speaking to every aspect of christian life
1578751 living for gods glory is solid christian truth in its all its fullness beauty and strength i wish i had had such a book in my hands when i was a young believer starting out on the journey to learn theology
1578752 this book is rooted in the conviction that calvinism is a gospel centered biblical theology for all of life joel beeke shows how gods grace is glorified in the believers mind and heart not only in the church but also in the world

1578772 theres not as much competition as there was a year ago for the last spots and depth chart movement were in a different place than last year
1578773 ricky being banged up and not out here is a big reason for that

1578789 back in the beginning in the self storage industry hardly anybody was doing anything on the internet as far as seo at least in my markets it was pretty much non existent so i had my run of the field for several years before i had any serious competition
1578790 one of the first search engines on which i saw bad data was when yahoo launched its local search
1578791 they apparently went out looking for names and addresses of storage facilities and they must have been pulling them from a lot of different sources
1578792 i would routinely search on my phone number for one of my facilities or search with my url
1578793 it was amazing how much bad data would come up id then try to contact whatever directory it was in to ask them if i could clean up my data
1578794 i would spend until one or two in the morning fixing this stuff
1578795 when i met localeze in san jose a few years ago i immediately saw that with these guys i wouldnt have to work quite as hard
1578796 they type what comes to mind and localeze drives those words into the listing to make the brand come out on the top of the page
1578797 in addition seven out of 10 of these search strings appear in the top position

1578808 out of unity comes security i dont think you can impose security from on top just look at yugoslavia for years it seemed as if everything was quiescent so i think we want to put unity first out of real unity which can only be based on understanding and mutual respect will come the kind of security that we really want and the people really want

1578815 we typically meet with the kandak commander after formation to discuss any issues or problems throughout the day the trainers are meeting and working with their companies
1578816 no day is a typical day with the ana it can change dramatically from day to day
1578817 this fob will help bring stability to the entire region weve merely shown them the way they are the ones doing the work
1578818 every mission that we go on is augmented by the ana
1578819 this allows the citizens of afghanistan to see members of their army working professionally with coalition forces it contributes to a sense of overwhelming pride in their government and they see their army progressing and succeeding in stamping out the taliban
1578820 many of the soldiers in 4th kandak learn combat skills fast training them and letting them handle explosives and teaching them to respect it will help strengthen their ability and national perception
1578821 obviously economic policy is an area where we need to improve our stance and credentials

1578830 for me the greatest joy is knowing that the book is being read it is an extraordinary feeling to have brought my mother back to life it shows that the nazis did not truly succeed in killing her it is not vengeance but it is a victory

1578861 this is quite the best time of the year to get inspired by summer fruits in food this summer is special for me the is constantly churning out eye catching amp delicious fruity delights a dime a dollar its difficult to catch up amp make each of them but im getting on slowly amp steadily a real feast for the eyes heres a stone fruit crisp i made inspired largely by this a single type of berry is hard enough to come by here where we live so peaches plums cherries and apricots are a few of summers sweetest treasures few culinary pleasures compare with biting into a ripe sweet peach bursting with juice or enjoying a sugary sweet plum at the peak of its season most of the luscious fruits of summer are known as stone fruits because of the stone like pit at the core of the fruit when fully ripe and at the peak of their season theres no better way to enjoy stone fruits than simply eating them just as they are fresh sweet and full of juice however the exquisite flavors of ripe stone fruits lend themselves to many creative uses be it fruit salads cobblers or compotes the crisp was to be done for the following day but i decided to do the fruit on day 1 not too sure if peaches amp plums were a hot combination i muddled ahead anyway trying to make the best of what i had by the time the fruit was done there was no ambiguity left the combination was finger licking good amp spoonfuls were doing the disappearing act so the bowl was hurriedly bundled into the fridge baked the crisp the next day must say that the flavours that overtook the house were fruity wafts filled the air amp the plummy peach or peachy plum syrup started bubbling over the edges they have been and are still called by various names such as croustade birds nest pudding or crows nest pudding they are all simple variations of cobblers and they are all based on seasonal fruits and berries in other words whatever fresh ingredients are readily at hand they are all homemade and simple to make and rely more on taste than fancy pastry preparation early settlers of america were very good at improvising when they first arrived they bought their favorite recipes with them such as english steamed puddings not finding their favorite ingredients they used whatever was available thats how all these traditional american dishes came about with such unusual names early colonist were so fond of these juicy dishes that they often served them as the main course for breakfast or even as a first course it was not until the late 19 century that they became primarily desserts recipe for peach amp plum crisp as adapted from brown sugar 1 2 cup flour 1 4 cup rolled oats 1 2 cup almonds 1 4 cup chopped ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground ginger 1 4 teaspoon butter 4 tablespoons melted method to make the topping combine the oats flour sugar ginger almonds and cinnamon together in a medium bowl stir in the butter amp mix until everything comes together in a dough like texture sprinkle the crumble evenly over the plum and peach mixture chopped peaches 2 cups chopped about 3 4 large peaches plums 12 14 pitted amp chopped granulated sugar 1 4 cup light brown sugar 1 4 cup cinnamon powder 1 tsp ginger powder 1 2 tsp cut the peaches and plums into bite sized 1 inch pieces gently simmer for 2 3 minutes with the ginger amp cinnamon dont overcook the fruit should retain its shape in a separate small bowl whisk together the cup sugar and the arrowroot sprinkle over the fruit toss gently but well allow to cool slightly put the fruit into an 8

1579150 given the centrality of work teams it is more than a bit remarkable how much our societys perspective is focused on the individual we school our children as individuals we hire train and reward employees as individuals yet we have great faith that individuals thrown into a team that has been put together with little thought devoted to its composition training development and leadership will be effective and successful science strongly suggests otherwise
1579151 identifying training needs can be seen in a much broader concept than traditionally thought
1579152 this inability of any manager to simply step outside the responsibilities of their managerial role as compared with an externally sourced coach whose primary responsibility is to the coachee precludes the ability of the coachee to be completely open on any topic
1579153 the whole idea of a coach is that everyone is part of the same team therefore the role of the coach is to develop their people so that they can reach the goal and win its that simple reaching the goal is a win win win that is it is a win for the player the coach and the organization

1579174 i ordered the muscle balm from you a few months ago and meant to tell you how wonderful it is omg its like a twist up tube of miracle that i can take with me anywhere id been under the treatment of 3 doctors for my neck injury was having to sleep elevated with a heating pad every night just to take the edge off the extreme pain when i put your balm on it seemed to penetrate straight into the tissue and the results were incredible im skeptical of almost anything even my own products but this worked it gave me just enough freedom of movement to where i could exercise my neck a little each day i truly think this is what allowed me to get over that injury there was just no way i couldve moved my head at all before thank you so much for taking the time to research and create such a potently effective product
1579175 having run several ultra marathons from 50k to 90 miles i have never felt as quickly recovered as when i used faerie made arnica muscle rub i could feel it working as i massaged it into my legs and was thrilled about how much better my legs felt afterwards i will continue to use this product after every ultra that i run
1579176 i have been using this on my feet at night and it feels so good i have arthritis and i really think this helps
1579177 one of my customers bought six arnica rubs she bought them for her husband anyhow she was with her daughter when her daughter gave birth and used the arnica rub on her daughters back during labor she said it did the trick
1579178 my husband swears your arnica muscle rub is the only thing that helps his back after working construction all day
1579179 this is the best i use it on all my clients
1579180 my daughter woke one morning with a vicious stiff neck and i swear if it werent for the arnica balm muscle rub shed probably still be walking around the house looking like quasimodo and crying fat pain filled tears it took exactly one day for the arnica balm to perform its magic we rubbed and massaged it in all day and the next morning no stiff neck no residual pain and no indication she had a problem to begin with
1579181 i got some stuff from your site for my moms bd she works out a lot and always complains about being all sore so i got her the muscle rub she had a sore place in her back and had been talking about going to get a massage to help but after putting your wonder rub on her back it was gone she had been sore there for months sounds like one of those stories people make up but its true lol she says thanks
1579182 the arnica rub is wonderful used it after my shower last night and slept well without the sore shoulder every time i turned
1579183 the random number generation starts from a seed value if the same seed is used repeatedly the same series of numbers is generated
1579184 one way to produce different sequences is to make the seed value time dependent

1579186 after much deliberation and having taken a good long hard look at what our customers want and what we want and what is good for us all along with our wonderful suppliers my business partner trish and i have decided on a return to the rockpool of old rockpool classic
1579187 i obviously have nothing to fear as long as i dont leave the area
1579188 i am not ashamed to confess that i am ignorant of what i do not know
1579189 the greatest handicap is to have sight and no vision
1579190 no me averg enzo de confesar que soy ignorante de lo que no tengo conocimiento
1579191 la descapacidad mas grande es tener vista pero no visi n
1579192 if we take the risk of personally touching and being touched by a suffering person the miracle of sight can break into our own darkness
1579193 si nos arriesgamos a tocar y ser tocados por una persona que sufre el milagro de la vista ser posible en nuestra propia oscuridad
1579194 el gobierno sabe perfectamente que es lo que nosotros pedimos y que es lo que nos molesta nosotros pedimos que se mejore la calidad del transantiago que se reduzca el d ficit del transantiago que se termine con esta odiosa discriminaci n entre comunas que tiene m s de 50 mil habitantes y las que tienen menos si el gobierno es capaz de arreglar esos problemas nosotros estamos dispuestos a sentarnos a la mesa
1579195 el compromiso del gobierno ha sido mantener las tarifas congeladas hasta diciembre por lo tanto los santiaguinos debemos saber que con o sin subsidio las tarifas van a subir el pr ximo a o y esa es una realidad que el ministro debe aclarar porque se apruebe o no este proyecto de ley las tarifas comenzar n a subir en enero 20 por mes por contrato
1579196 la tarifa permanecer congelada hasta fin de 2008 y que cualquier incremento el 2009 va a ser moderado y gradual los 20 pesos mensuales es lo que contemplan las bases de licitaci n no es que la tarifa tenga que comenzar a subir todos los meses en 20 pesos
1579197 los beneficios de este proyecto son para el conjunto del pa s para todas las comunas del pa s hay beneficios que tienen relaci n con baja de tarifas y que en una primera etapa se aplica a las ciudades de m s de 50 mil habitantes hay beneficios directamente para ciudades de menos de 50 mil habitantes como los subsidios de zonas aisladas como la imposibilidad de que los sostenedores que los municipios puedan tener para sus escuelas mecanismos de transporte escolar como la renovaci n de los buses viejos que es un problema muy serio en sectores rurales
1579198 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do

1579214 as our season progressed and it became obvious we were not going to reach the goals we had entering this year we began internal discussions on the best time to convert brandon back to a starting role
1579215 we believe that giving him time to stretch out in tacoma and then hopefully make some starts for the big league club before spending the 2008 offseason preparing to come to camp as a starting pitcher for 2009 is the best route for his development
1579216 in our minicamps he was good and then it was just a matter of him being able to hold up in pass protection
1579217 a lot of people dont think ill be able to do it because of my size but i tell them all the time low pad wins
1579218 theres not too many linebackers in the nfl my size so ive got a little advantage on that point i was prepared in college to block first and run second so thats the kind of mentality i bring
1579219 at first you do kind of question his size but that kid has a big heart and thats all that matters in this league

1579234 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1579235 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1579236 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1579237 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1579238 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1579239 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs

1579394 its obviously an amazing feat while it is not very nice being a victim

1579494 to me politics arent a choice you make theyre just a way of life in that sense i am trying to be more positive than political because im already political to begin with i think that at the same time as theres a lot of money being put into hip hop that could be deemed negative or misogynistic or self destructive by the same token theres a lot of guys who are coming up trying to be positive and rebel against that putting their careers on the line
1579495 of course we have a lot of expectations but our supreme concern is the peaceful environment for the voters we also want to see the armm voters really understand and trust the machines that will be used in the elections

1579564 look gab is 4 years old he eats what we choose for him he doesnt really know what he wants and he can find something that he likes where we were quentin and etienne were not aware that hamburgers were not an option thats why they wanted them because they dont know any better but they would have been perfectly happy with another choice on the menu they are not picky we are not going to change restaurants like this i am choosing the place we were at and you can either follow me with gab and the rest of my family or go somewhere else but this is ridiculous to just walk out of a restaurant and make a scene in front of a 4 year old who would have been perfectly content ordering a pizza sandwich

1579590 my dear friend who has done a lot for the torah for the sake of heaven who will still do more
1579591 for the first time in the history of our nation we come upon a development that we are unfamiliar with and that we cannot remember whereby the ruling party in our midst will come and offer up jerusalem even to the worst of our enemies
1579592 israel does not need general elections now in light of the existential challenges facing us
1579593 i wouldnt advise anyone to base the future on polls
1579594 the polls are a mood and this will change im sure that i will win the primaries
1579595 it is very strange that livni who prides herself on being among the partys founders is unwilling to state explicitly that this is her home it raises questions and looks really bad from a public standpoint
1579596 she intends to win and isnt dealing with other things
1579597 we dont need general elections at a time like this when such complex matters are on the agenda we must form a national unity government and contend with these challenges
1579598 i doubt that netanyahu can reverse his stand on welfare cuts

1579659 they told me that there were serious problems of human relations
1579660 but only a few days ago you told me that you had also heard unpleasant things about her
1579661 im not the only one who believed that nili cohen was not the person who would save this court
1579662 that was the general opinion and that was the main reason for our opposition to her appointment the discussion during the meeting of the justices was much more practical than people think they wanted to bring nili cohen here as a reinforcement candidate and thats very complicated in order to bring someone from the academic world here it has to be a very specific type of academic world a person who has never seen a courtroom who has never even crossed the threshold is not a person that this court needs i am trying to strengthen the constitutional aspect of the court the public aspect of the work here
1579663 it was clear that most of the justices were siding with beinisch the president designate and turning their backs on the incumbent president this was a situation the likes of which had never been seen before in the supreme court over three years before the end of the presidents candidacy it was clear to everyone that the center of power had been transferred from the president himself to the person designated to be the next president
1579664 i simply went from one to the other and spoke with everyone from whom i thought there was a chance of getting information until i got the whole picture
1579665 i knew there had been a major drama in the nili cohen affair and i wanted to investigate it thoroughly the matter of nili cohen was less interesting to me that the transfer of power three and a half years before the changing of the presidents there was an exchange of power and that is something that fascinates me
1579666 these are simply things that happen when someone loses power when his locks have been shorn the power is naturally transferred thats the nature of man and the nature of every organization in my opinion the nili cohen affair forced beinisch to float to the top much earlier than she had planned she had been a quiet and invisible justice largely unheard except in limited forums
1579667 i assume she did she herself understood that it didnt help her publicly but she was very determined on this matter she did not regret that the appointment did not go through beinisch is a strong and determined woman when she takes on a challenge she takes on a challenge weve seen that in her personal history shes willing to take risks and its impossible not to respect her for that she has a strong character im not even talking about her beauty when i saw her for the first time about 20 years ago she took my breath away
1579668 he told me that i was not yet the president and it was not certain that i would be president and what was i thinking when i opposed the viewpoint of the president like that
1579669 i came in and told her that i understood that she had serious complaints against nili personal complaints beinisch stopped me immediately and said that her opposition was not personal and that she was opposed to the appointment because she didnt think that someone from the academic world should be appointed now and that was the end of the conversation
1579670 i cant answer that in his place but i would guess that he understood at the time he was very hurt anyone who met him then could see that he had changed completely he wasnt the same person he had lost some of his vitality
1579671 the justices pass along a large number of drafts to one another
1579672 one tells the other i can agree with you on condition that you omit this and that sentence there are entire negotiations between them in order to consolidate a majority on a certain issue sometimes justices have to relinquish one sentence or another they sit at meetings speak among themselves and deliberate sometimes they also consider how the ruling will affect the court
1579673 our hope was that the government would understand and do something
1579674 misha if you yourself dont care think about your father what would your father say about the things youve written here
1579675 the justices would certainly prefer to continue conducting the entire business under a mantle of secrecy
1579676 but as u s supreme court justice louis brandeis once said sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants barak adopted this saying but he of course is referring to everything but the court
1579677 i think that one should expose as much as possible the court is today perhaps the strongest organization in the country its an aggressive institutionalized organization and there are power struggles and power hierarchies there the justices determine every step in our lives without our even noticing in everyday life how much of it they have determined
1579678 in the long run i think that if we treat the justices more like human beings and less like the sons of gods and understand them better we will be able to accept their decisions more easily even if we dont agree with them
1579679 i am among the members of the public who believe that the role of the supreme court is to set norms to move processes of social evolution to deal with human rights that is what i expect from it from my point of view that is its job barak always told me you are dealing with 2 percent of the things we do and i replied that those are the 2 percent that give you the title supreme otherwise youre just another appeals court and that doesnt interest me
1579680 i dont want to commit myself but the work was so hard exhausting and pressured that the way i feel now this is the last project in that area
1579681 because they have been in the supreme court for only six years its impossible to go all the way with them in this book but these are justices with very complex personalities they are unpredictable and they look at things differently its interesting that they were appointed together as though representing two sides of the divide one liberal and the other conservative and sometimes they can be found on the same side of the divide

1579685 beinisch made the statement during a high court discussion of petitions against a plea bargain signed by attorney general menahem mazuz
1579686 it is clear that the proposals you are disseminating are another in a series of steps that sow strife and disharmony and are intended to crush the existing structure of the judicial system and demolish the institution of the supreme court president
1579687 we view the supreme court presidents letter as unfortunate as she chose to respond to the justice ministers consultative letter by issuing a statement to the media since the day he took office minister friedmann has worked to strengthen and improve the justice system and increase the publics faith in it
1579688 proud of the supreme court headed by president dorit beinisch and see my job as prime minister as protecting it its independence and its ability to continue being the bastion of democracy and the keeper of its seal
1579689 acting to strengthen and improve the judicial system and to increase the publics faith in it
1579690 we are sorry to read the letter by the supreme court president who chose to answer a topical letter of consultation by the justice minister with a press release
1579691 must not be solved by arm twisting but through a public hearing
1579692 i dont know if the level of corruption in government institutions has risen
1579693 however it is bad enough that governmental institutions are seen as corrupt by the public one must bear in mind that not all inappropriate behavior constitutes a criminal offense
1579694 the girls are in much more serious trouble due mostly to their naivete and their education from home thus they get into trouble more easily and their problems are very serious
1579695 we are talking about girls aged 17 25 who because they have nowhere to sleep will go home with a man just so they have a roof over their heads
1579696 there is a real problem in locating homeless teenage girls
1579697 many of them are picked up by men who take advantage of them making them sell their bodies in order to survive that means that in many cases the girls cannot be found out on the streets at night but often find shelter in the outlets of the sex industry
1579698 people are increasingly alienated from the political system i want to consider the winograd committee in that context i want to consider the legalization of the political process wherein the only thing the people want to know is whether a politician is innocent or guilty the knesset is not fulfilling its task of supervising and criticizing the government the establishment of a judicial committee of inquiry is meant to let someone else decide whos right the culture of these committees is anti politics
1579699 from a new supreme court the cause is the same old government
1579700 the ombudsmans decision in this matter was tendentious and was intended from the start to satisfy president beinisch my letter to beinisch was not given to the press by me in contrast an announcement was sent to the press about the president having filed a complaint against me a proceeding that is internal confidential and personal and that is without even mentioning the ombudsmans decision which was forwarded in a personal confidential for the addressee only letter but is today circulating in the media
1579701 the court brought the politicization upon itself because it deals with matters pertaining to social values politics and security
1579702 its a scandal that lawyers are represented on the committee when they must appear before the judges they appoint
1579703 i have to debate with myself whether i deserve to put out the flames and whether they may disturb the rights of the water pail
1579704 public slander to raise incitement against them quite a few tendentious attempts dont listen to these claims they are based on misinformation and deception the reality is very far from what is described

1579740 god pronounced of his creation that it was very good
1579741 young earth creationists will agree with me that the laws of nature have been instituted by god according to these laws god put in place a system of renewal including death and decay he created this specifically so that the world would last if he created a world without death and decay it would soon be overrun by the organisms that he created the beauty of the system he created awes scientists and lay people alike each day based on the multiplication rate of some bacterial organism this would only take a few days unless there was some method of curbing that growth
1579742 well if god did it this way he must be a monster
1579743 many claim that genesis is only symbolic a kind of analogy however if applying this idea that genesis is only symbolic then one has to ask the question where do we learn that god is creator we can of course go to genesis 1 1 which says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth but if genesis is only symbolic to be consistent we would have to question whether the words god created are also symbolic we would have to ask what this really means
1579744 christ died on a cross because of sin and death and the necessary shedding of blood for the remission of sins the origin and basis of this is in the book of genesis we wear clothing because god gave clothes because of sin we read this in the book of genesis to understand christian doctrine we must understand the foundations of doctrine given in the book of genesis if genesis cannot be taken literally there is no foundation for christian doctrine therefore christian doctrine no longer has meaning
1579745 there are other instances where jesus quoted from or referred to and thus accepted genesis

1579771 it made me feel very bad i felt that im not going to do it over my dead body
1579772 he made me know that if i dont cooperate with him something bad will happen to me that if i made an attempt to run away it would end in taking my life so i was really scared about that
1579773 grabbed her tank top and bra and pulled them down and exposed her breasts
1579774 do you have the strength to hate maybe maybe not this is why hate gets a bad rap those who say its bad are the ones who arent strong enough to carry the weight of hate in their minds they wish they could hate out loud they secretly hate but what good is that its not real hate its just cowardice there it is concealed hatred is cowardice
1579775 hate is good hate is strong hate takes passion hate is not empty hate is not the end hate keeps the mind focused and the blood thin

1579786 part of an overhaul of the states sex offender registry which includes real time updates for newly registered offenders
1579787 at least from the time of the courts decision in
1579788 managed to reach the correct result of saving the state and the country from a major and almost certainly harmful expansion in the use of capital punishment
1579789 im sympathetic to the mobile bid because i would like to see it come here
1579790 but im not going to push for one or the other its too important to become a provincial issue of where jobs go
1579791 youve got to get this tanker deal right for the right price and the right product for the american people and for our security for the next 50 years
1579792 thats a lot more important than if mobile gets more jobs or some other part of the country gets more jobs
1579793 they need to understand what this means for the panhandle i am quite shocked of the rhetoric that were getting
1579794 the familys goal is to add to the bayou chico business community which is already known as a large economic engine for the city and county
1579795 this is why pelicans perch marina amp boatyard is considered to be such a treasure
1579796 its convenient to traffic and therefore boat owners its sheltered by the barrancas avenue bridge and a peninsula of land and its floating docks provide for easier access to the boats moored there
1579797 the transformation of the facility has come a long way since we first arrived there in september 2007
1579798 the yard is cleaned up and secured at night this year was the best experience i have had over the many years of bringing my boat here to pelicans perch
1579799 the exhibits are all new the visitor center itself is not but all of the models are new and we have a new 11 minute video tour as well
1579800 foods from different countries are the same as the culture
1579801 when you eat the different foods you learn the culture
1579802 the south african peppadew is a sweet hot pepper that is particularly good with the french soft cheese
1579803 we have one of largest collections of day lilies in the area
1579804 we have various tropical vines and tropical perennials ornamental grass numerous brightly colored annuals trees and shrubs our old antique roses are very pretty when in bloom
1579805 if they want a tour guide one will be provided tour guides discuss the plants their uses in the landscape and some of the animals and insects commonly found in the gardens
1579806 but if you want to learn about the plants and want to know the history of the gardens the tour guide is there for you
1579807 some students work in the gardens in connection with their classes
1579808 the memorial gardens acts as a living classroom where students and visitors can identify the flowers and shrubs that help make up the northwest florida landscape
1579809 the plants we have growing here are plants that are native to northwest florida the hibiscus is popular in this area we also have a wide variety of ornamental grass one popular type is little kitten which is also associated with this area
1579810 we decided to see how the cactus would do growing here
1579811 since traditionally cactus enjoys dry soil and extreme heat we werent sure how they would grow in this climate since we have quite a bit of rain so far they are doing very well we also decided to try growing pineapple plants they too are doing well when the plant matures it has edible fruit a pineapple this is of course where the plant gets its name
1579812 its upsetting to me because i really didnt know that
1579813 i see people on boats and jet skis so it makes you think that its alright
1579814 some families cant enjoy their local beaches because they are polluted and kids are getting sick largely because of human and animal waste in the water
1579815 youve got fecal matter in the woods that impacts the body of water
1579816 the gulfside waters along this coast are as pretty as anywhere ive ever seen
1579817 this is a war not only against the us but against our way of freedom
1579818 we have been fighting for over 16 years against islamic extremism it is also my war
1579819 weve received numerous reports from combatant commanders on the effectiveness of the 09 limas versus the private contract linguists and demand is extremely high
1579820 we have to make some breakthroughs on how we assign trust assess and utilize those who have direct contact with foreign entities
1579821 that unfolding story carries a lot of implications with it and its a huge cultural shift for the entire nation
1579822 they hear things that are said around them they are able to see things that others cant see
1579823 he was pretty much giving an order to have the commander killed
1579824 right there a life was saved you can see just by knowing a bit of slang being a native speaker it can make a difference
1579825 there is a thirst to get this knowledge in any way
1579826 it seems the farther inland you go the less rain there is
1579827 the past 10 years the majority of years have been drought years we really can no longer take our water resources for granted
1579828 weve seen a couple of bad stings where you can see the welts and you could actually see the tentacle drag marks
1579829 no infantry in modern warfare has been on the lines longer than the 34th infantry and they are doing it again
1579830 he told me we really wanted the earth to open up and swallow us
1579831 he wrote to me whos this civilian pyle youre always talking about
1579832 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1579833 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1579834 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1579835 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1579836 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1579837 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1579838 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1579839 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1579840 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1579841 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1579842 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1579843 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1579844 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1579845 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1579846 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1579847 in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1579848 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1579849 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1579850 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1579851 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1579852 did not want to hear the word in the first days of his presidency bush rejected advice from the cia to wiretap russian president vladimir putin in february 2001 in vienna where he was staying in a hotel where the cia had a listening device planted in the wall of the presidential suite in need only of a battery change
1579853 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1579854 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1579855 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1579856 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1579857 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1579858 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1579859 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1579860 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
1579861 because of the lack of coordination and oversight its hit or miss in terms of who gets help
1579862 we still have a child poverty rate that is extremely high per the report
1579863 its always best to quickly solve a short term problem to keep it from becoming a long term one
1579864 so do all the other splendid buildings in washington d c for you are a citizen of the united states
1579865 engaged in bizarre antics that your average zegna clad washington lobbyist would never have dreamed of
1579866 sees that banks are safe places for people to keep their money
1579867 im a strong advocate that the economy is playing a huge part in our owner surrenders
1579868 theres a point we have to decide how far can we go how much can we do an animal is sick and suffering thats our reality
1579869 all the adults had stage 2 heartworm disease that pretty much tells us he never wormed those dogs ever
1579870 this march tonight is to tell those undesirable elements of the neighborhood that we dont want them here
1579871 this shows the partnership between the police and the community
1579872 were going to have 40 to 50 officers swinging by still taking calls but swinging by when they get a chance
1579873 you are all wet and will damage my beautiful boat
1579874 love im sorry but i just need to be alone now
1579875 but why did time help me when no one else would
1579876 weve been able to dispel the myth that children of the poverty level of a housing authority community cant learn the state standards and make the expected annual gains
1579877 we worked to do it in five years and did it in four
1579878 were bursting at the seams and we think we can attribute that to our success
1579879 were trying to capture the school in its true essence
1579880 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1579881 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1579882 the era of u s funded major infrastructure projects is over
1579883 accurately highlights that iraqs revenues have grown substantially in recent years
1579884 still needs to improve the speed and effectiveness of its budget execution and the transparency of its budgeting and accounting practices
1579885 we estimate that the iraqi government could spend between 35 3 billion and 35 9 billion of its overall 49 9 billion budget
1579886 it would be unwise to use the reports to compare hospitals because of the small numbers and lack of verification
1579887 were still early in this even though its the second six months
1579888 over time we will get enough data to look at trends
1579889 we have not made the progress id like to see
1579890 its not like a car where you do a little bit of maintenance you check the oil the air filter the oil filter and off you go and then in four years you buy a new one
1579891 south carolinas estimate of 900 is not significantly higher than our prior estimate of approximately 800 this information could suggest that prevention and outreach efforts in the state are working
1579892 it is our basic belief the number will not be significantly different
1579893 people get very excited about their causes and lack the sense to see if the information backs them up
1579894 you dont see their bodies going blotchily red and hear them howling like a banshee
