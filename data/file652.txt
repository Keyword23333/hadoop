6520010 s lo la gesti n de tarek willian saab ha solucionado los problemas de las comunidades en la entidad
6520011 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6520012 the only amish community outside the united states in the americas
6520013 basically they feel sense of insecurity and some of the heads of families had come to meet their representatives here in jalalabad batandi
6520014 we want that they should live with the neighbours of majority community to further strengthen the age old bonds
6520015 some miscreants who are hell bent upon to create communal tension in the region should be defeated with tough stand
6520016 he ajaz was on way to jammu and near nowshera some miscreants stopped his vehicle and thrashed him
6520017 i left jammu at 1 30 and had a narrow escape when miscreants attacked near kellard
6520018 kashmiri muslims are not against hindus or the yatra but the agitation began because kashmiri land had been transferred to non state subjects which negated the disputed status of the state
6520019 we have no quarrel with the people of jammu on the contrary the hurriyat conference is in favour of maintaining the geographical unity of the state and its tradition harmony
6520020 but the real issue is that the state has been fighting for the right of self determination for sixty years and the impression that people remembered it after the shrine board matter is totally incorrect
6520021 in reality no one has asked non locals to leave the valley
6520022 gluing room and that is where the worlds best table tennis players can be found juicing their paddles and sniffing glue between matches
6520023 volatile compounds and allow only water based glues paddles will be tested in a special glue sniffing contraption before matches essentially going through doping control just like olympic athletes
6520024 short pips paddles with short rubber nubs rather than the
6520025 the new rule will make the rackets slower so players dont like it u
6520026 they like it as fast as possible but for spectators it will be better i think the players will adjust and do whatever they have to do to add speed to the racket theyll start using carbon blades find new glues they will find ways
6520027 they want the game to look better on tv for the spectators said wang who lost her quarterfinal match to li jia wei of singapore 4 1
6520028 the ball can be hard to see especially for people who dont watch the sport a lot so they want to try to do something to make it easier but the players will feel less power off the racket so it will be a little different
6520029 i was famous here 10 years ago but no so many people remember me anymore
6520030 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6520031 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6520032 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6520033 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6520034 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6520035 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6520036 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6520037 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6520038 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6520039 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6520040 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
6520041 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
6520042 the market is the best mechanism ever invented for efficiently allocating resources to maximize production and i also think that there is a connection between the freedom of the marketplace and freedom more generally
6520043 she had to think very practically about how do you make money
6520044 how does the system work that led me to have an orientation to ask hardheaded questions during my formative years there was still ideological competition between a social democratic or even socialist agenda and a free market milton friedman agenda i think it was natural for me to ask questions of both sides and maybe try to synthesize approaches
6520045 doesnt have the slightest sense of where folks like me are coming from
6520046 the animal services portion of the bond 154 1 million will be used to replace three existing animal shelters build two new shelters and expand and renovate three others provide more kennel space to reduce pet overcrowding in shelters create more spay and neuter clinics to help reduce overpopulation on the streets and increase adoption opportunities
6520047 do you have enough employees and money to enforce this program
6520048 400 000 animals need surgery in the city to comply with the ordinance do you have enough employees and money to do all these surgeries
6520049 good because i dont want you asking for resources later
6520050 i have the mayor wrapped around my little finger in city hall the mayor gave me a big bear hug and said hell give me anything i want i just have to ask this bad press should do it
6520051 i have a lot of problems with the way this loan was written

6520066 sometimes when people are walking they come across it marijuana and visitors to the park should always report it when they see it
6520067 my family and i are experiencing grief that is indescribable and at times unbearable every time i close my eyes the images in my head are of my dad in flames screaming hollering and running for his life while on fire in excruciating and traumatizing pain
6520068 im innocent im going to walk out of this place with my head held high
6520069 right now the family is in there hugging and enjoying time as a family together
6520070 the most important thing is that casey is home and her parents are very grateful
6520071 now we are asking the public to please help us find caylee now more than ever we are convinced that she was kidnapped
6520072 i believe she made a mistake handed her daughter off and she is alive
6520073 the fact that casey anthony has bonded out of jail changes nothing in our investigation and our determination to resolve this case
6520074 the simple fact of the matter is people charged with crimes bond out of detention facilities every day
6520075 five vehicles including one sumo 2 maruti 1 gypsy were first attacked with rods and lathis and then set on fire
6520076 congress leader is safe as security guards managed to rescue him along with other members of family
6520077 the supply was meant for public distribution but the vehicle was stopped and looted by protesters on its way
6520078 they supposedly fixed the problem which the pilot later said was with the air conditioning and then we took off
6520079 the plane was wobbling from one side to another then i began to suspect we would crash i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions which i think woke me up
6520080 i took a child into the truck and he thought he was in a film but he asked when will this film end and where is my dad he asked if it was real if he was in a film but he wanted the film to end
6520081 those responsible say that it will take two days at the most to finish identifying people by their fingerprints dna identification will take a bit more
6520082 we have to closely monitor the records but we see no reason to take such measures he told a news conference
6520083 its been years since engine failure on take off or a fire has prevented a flight from continuing
6520084 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of aug 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6520085 a defeat at that end of the world would be a defeat for french troops
6520086 everyone knows that terrorism is particularly fed by what is happening in afghanistan
6520087 i want the families to know everything they have that right
6520088 no french soldier during the incident came on the radio to complain that they were taking friendly fire
6520089 no french soldier after the incident has reported through the chain of command that might have been the case none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordinance
6520090 because the forces were very interlocked the taliban insurgents and the french forces there would have of course been collateral damage if the bombs had been deployed
6520091 id say this is the most fundamental change weve made ever to the marketplace
6520092 consumers are voting with their wallets and saying auctions arent really the way i want to buy cosmetics or something like that
6520093 very opportunistic but also in line with what their customers are telling them they want
6520094 this will be viewed as ebay continues to push paypal down everyones throat
6520095 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6520096 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians
6520097 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6520098 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6520099 leading alliance members came to us and whispered in our ears hoping that we do not halt cooperation with nato on afghanistan
6520100 it closes the book on a very very sad tragedy

6520104 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin its looking bleak but every effort is being made
6520105 when i first spoke with ralph on the phone i had never had a conversation with him in my life the one thing i got from this first conversation was that he wanted to do something else i didnt know exactly what it was and i dont think he knew what it was either there was a mix of restlessness excitement and fear all rolled into one the record evolved after the production began i think that we all got more and more excited as the process went along because things were turning out better than we had anticipated
6520106 it started out as a record that would be half acoustic country and half stanley sounding the more we got into it the more we realized we were making two separate records rather than two halves of one record we continued in the acoustic country direction
6520107 mike started out as the engineer only and became a defacto producer as the album evolved i was introduced to mike by randall deaton mike had worked on several previous lonesome day releases as well as records by rhonda vincent randy kohrs and jim lauderdale he was also an intern for bill vorndick when we recorded the clinch mountain country cd he also had quite a bit to do with the musical arrangements mike was there for every note so he got what he wanted from the musicians
6520108 the decision was made in part by the graphics designer jami anderson we wanted the packaging to be bright and vivid but fairly simple we wanted more visual images in the packaging rather than a lot of words all the essential information credits track listing is hidden behind the cd this record is such a departure for ralph that we knew he would be talking about the songs quite a bit so it didnt seem nesassary to include a bunch of words in the design
6520109 we think this is good music that is appealing to a lot of different people it is very hard to label this cd played with the traditional bluegrass instruments but sounding a lot like an old country record we are pushing this album to the country and americana audience as well as bluegrass it has been added to over 50 secondary country stations in the last three weeks those are just the ones that our radio promoter is working we are confident that there are several other stations playing the song but are not on the promoters list
6520110 i am putting together a new band as we speak a very talented musician from nashville named todd livingston is the band leader and he is filling out the remaining members right now we have played a couple shows already i have two more shows to do with the clinch mountain boys and then i am on my own

6520140 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
6520141 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
6520142 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
6520143 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
6520144 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
6520145 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
6520146 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine
6520147 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6520148 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom

6520170 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6520171 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6520172 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6520173 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6520174 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

6520177 every so often we see reports of this kind in the saudi media i believe its part of the saudi demonization of relations with israel
6520178 the problem was that the article was compellingly written in the present tense without any reference to the fact that it was a preview
6520179 the truth is whether you are quick to decide like me or you need a lot of time to pick the perfect dress there is one out there for you dont give up until you find it its very important that you feel like a fairy tale princess on your big day and you need to feel confident and beautiful dress shop workers are very helpful and knowledgeable and the dress you have been dreaming of is sure to come along your way youll know when it does
6520180 my mom told me that i should put as much money as possible into the catering and reception i disagreed i would rather have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches served at my wedding than have less than beautiful pictures to look at i also argued that no one would remember what we had to eat at our wedding in a year but that i would still have my pictures as you can see i had made up my mind and was a bit overzealous about the issue

6520182 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6520183 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6520184 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6520185 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6520186 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6520187 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6520188 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6520189 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6520190 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6520191 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6520192 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6520193 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6520194 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6520195 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6520196 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6520197 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6520198 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6520199 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6520200 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6520201 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6520202 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6520203 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6520204 we studied the properties of disease causing viruses that evolved to infect mucosal surfaces to engineer a coating that enables our drug delivery particles to penetrate mucus layers in minutes in our new work we have improved the coatings considerably to allow faster penetration for a wider array of particle sizes
6520205 we looked at what we could do to address them and the whole area of air quality as it relates to the emission of ammonia from poultry houses
6520206 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like
6520207 and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient
6520208 by understanding how calcium is detected in the mouth we can either make it easier to consume by reducing its bad taste or even make pharmacological agents that make it taste better
6520209 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on
6520210 also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods
6520211 the product is safe to humans animals and the environment
6520212 childrens rejection of unpalatable medications and bitter tasting foods is a complex product of maturing sensory systems genetic variation experiences and culture
6520213 a better understanding of the sensory world of the child and the scientific basis for distaste and how to ameliorate it is a public health priority
6520214 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6520215 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6520216 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6520217 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6520218 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6520219 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6520220 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6520221 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6520222 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6520223 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6520224 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6520225 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6520226 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6520227 it closes the book on a very very sad tragedy
6520228 unfortunately those who are still alive will always suffer from his actions
6520229 youre probably thinking a normal teenager doesnt do this well ask dick
6520230 at the end of the day there was no way i was not going to put this girl first before whatever
6520231 michael guglielmucci has informed us that he does not suffer from cancer was never diagnosed with cancer and has never suffered from the disease this admission has come as a great shock to everyone including his wife and family who had no knowledge of the matter
6520232 it is not because other people are dead that our affection for them grows faint it is because we ourselves are dying
6520233 he was a nice kid a friendly guy he didnt get into trouble he was at home most of the time he always helped people out if he could

6520235 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands squad for the natwest series after careful consideration
6520236 were delighted with the new faces weve brought in weve been working hard all summer to significantly improve the squad
6520237 find your own space we were all here at five
6520238 this guys my idol youre about even with me in quality but youre way up on me in quantity
6520239 with summer gas prices reaching an all time high the last thing long island drivers need are gas stations hitting them with exorbitant prices for paying with a credit card
6520240 our investigation revealed that long island is a hotbed for gas stations that engage in deceptive practices where they display one price as a way to lure customers and then charge them more at the pump
6520241 y ou may not impose any surcharge on a visa transaction you may however offer a discount for cash transactions provided that the offer is clearly disclosed to customers and the cash price is presented as a discount from the standard price charged for all other forms of payment
6520242 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6520243 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6520244 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6520245 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6520246 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6520247 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6520248 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6520249 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6520250 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6520251 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6520252 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6520253 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6520254 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6520255 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6520256 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6520257 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6520258 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6520259 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6520260 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6520261 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6520262 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6520263 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6520264 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6520265 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6520266 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6520267 the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer
6520268 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6520269 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6520270 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6520271 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6520272 i have four titanium plates in my neck ive had 14 surgeries over the years
6520273 we dont know if its a boy or a girl plus we are going to put him in a black room itll be a goth baby so it doesnt matter if it is a boy or a girl
6520274 ive suffered from episodes of cardiogenic syncope for the last 17 years or so but doctors ran a series of tests that came up inconclusive

6520363 the average child misses nearly five days of school each year due to illness the common cold alone causes 22 million missed school days nationwide
6520364 by taking just a few minutes to teach children how and when to wash their hands parents can help make sure their children will miss fewer days of school and will be less likely to go to school with a cold or other mild ailment that makes learning difficult as an added bonus parents may also miss fewer work days while caring for a sick child
6520365 start by having your children wet their hands and apply liquid or bar soap
6520366 then tell them to sing the abc song while rubbing their hands vigorously front back and between the fingers that should take about 15 or 20 seconds next rinse and thoroughly dry the hands
6520367 remind your children to wash their hands before eating after going to the bathroom playing outside or sneezing or blowing their nose

6520392 things are still unclear because the politicians have failed they should give way to civil society and a truce to get the country out of this crisis

6520394 that should be expected especially since in the government the resolution will create a split at the highest levels
6520395 we think that its a precise resolution that should not raise any objections

6520397 for a number of reasons individuals make claims or commit acts that weaken national unity and cohesion due to their racist tribal ethnic or xenophobic character
6520398 by enacting these measures the state will heal open wounds between ivory coast communities and create an environment that fosters social harmony
6520399 what kinds of actions would be covered at what point would they be considered criminal
6520400 we should proceed carefully because such a law could become a barrier to freedom of expression
6520401 over the last decade ivory coast has gained a reputation for being xenophobic adopting such a law counts as both a partial acknowledgment of this fact and a solution to the problem
6520402 applied properly it will address the problem at its root by making it impossible for ivorians to think of immigrants racial ethnic or religious differences in negative terms as with the elimination of the residency card last november the goal is to restore a sense of justice for those who have been mistreated
6520403 what disturbs us about this law is that we havent completed the studies
6520404 there are some gaps where the law fails to take into account current circumstances especially with regards to political parties and tribal issues
6520405 politicians rely on tribalism for political mobilisation when ethnic groups honor the head of state they do so according to tribal customs we in civil society are waiting to see how this law will be applied
6520406 whats most important is a peaceful living environment that allows us to contribute to the development of our host country and as a consequence that of our mother country also one must always respect the law and by the same token well fulfill our duties
6520407 its a step towards better relations between ivory coast and neighboring countries since the ouagadougou accord was signed in burkina faso march 2007 weve been working tirelessly for peace this law and the abolition of residency cards are signs that things are back to normal
6520408 we must strengthen ties of friendship brotherhood and cooperation between ivory coast and all neighboring countries and extending beyond that to all of west africa the continent and our friends throughout the world

6520417 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6520418 that blowhard needs to close his yap or lose his job
6520419 we feel like weve been led down the garden path and our interest in working in partnership and leading our mission as educators is now being used against us
6520420 morehead has responded without objection to virtually identical requests in other similar litigation
6520421 oh no you dont because you are related to each other
6520422 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6520423 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6520424 there are a lot of republicans in new mexico who are not as excited about their senate candidate as the democrats are about theirs
6520425 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office
6520426 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6520427 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6520428 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6520429 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6520430 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods

6520437 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6520438 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6520439 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6520440 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6520441 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6520442 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6520443 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree

6520452 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
6520453 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
6520454 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6520455 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6520456 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6520457 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6520458 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6520459 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants

6520476 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6520477 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

6520483 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6520484 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6520485 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6520486 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again

6520497 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6520498 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6520499 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified

6520555 indian jewellers for example are paying far bigger premiums to gold importers in order to meet the rise in demand
6520556 indian demand should rise rapidly over the next few months especially with the countrys main religious holidays approaching which should provide an additional boost

6520573 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car

6520583 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6520584 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6520585 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6520586 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming

6520612 sole goal is to safely and rapidly deliver humanitarian aid to alleviate human suffering and save lives
6520613 to show russia that we can come to the aid of a european ally and that we can do it at will whenever and wherever we want
6520614 we live in fear our minds houses and cities became our prisons evil done to others turns against us
6520615 there can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator
6520616 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6520617 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6520618 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6520619 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6520620 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6520621 poudarja pahor po njegovih besedah bo za to potrebna splo na mobilizacija vseh razpolo ljivih sredstev

6520624 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6520625 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6520626 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6520627 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6520628 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6520629 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6520630 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6520631 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
6520632 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6520633 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6520634 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late

6520663 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6520664 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6520665 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6520666 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6520667 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6520668 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6520669 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6520670 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6520671 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6520672 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6520673 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6520674 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6520675 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6520676 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6520677 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6520678 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6520679 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6520680 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6520681 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6520682 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6520683 todo es mentira ya no lo volvere a hacer te prometo ke voy a cambiar dame una 2da oportunidad

6520688 este acordo determina as condi es principais requeridas para a presen a tempor ria das tropas americanas
6520689 isto um sinal de confian a no esquema do aparato militar e de seguran a do iraque que est tomando cada vez mais responsabilidades
6520690 como o acordo n o est terminado n o podem haver datas
6520691 sempre dissemos que o papel a miss o e o tamanho das tropas da coaliz o devem estar baseados nas condi es do terreno e do que se necessita
6520692 as tropas iraquianas demonstraram que est o sendo cada vez mais fortes
6520693 houve avan os muito substanciais at este momento mas isso n o significa que achamos que est terminado
6520694 ainda n o duradoura n o sustent vel por si pr pria
6520695 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6520696 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6520697 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6520698 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6520699 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6520700 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6520701 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6520702 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6520703 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6520704 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6520705 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6520706 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6520707 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6520708 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6520709 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6520710 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6520711 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells

6520719 the basic tenants of the program were strong the notion of developing strong community family professional relationships teacher professional development collegiality among faculty dedication to school and strong student centered learning are all things that are in place at our nations most successful school
6520720 hope change and more and more money for our schools
6520721 there were some successes some failures and mush to be learned from the effort
6520722 as an aside i feel sorry for parents who have children in spartys classroom he is an obvious propagandist and probably does his best to indoctrinate children to his philosophy pathetic
6520723 chris boob has an unbecoming habit of gratuitously attacking peoples spouses and children that is because chris boob is a pos
6520724 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
6520725 if a man has an indispensable skill he has leverage if a man can be easily replaced he unionizes
6520726 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6520727 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6520728 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6520729 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6520730 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6520731 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6520732 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6520733 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6520734 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6520735 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6520736 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6520737 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6520738 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6520739 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6520740 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6520741 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6520742 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6520743 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6520744 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6520745 no trippin we just have to stop dumping raw feces and piss into the ocean simple
6520746 the pain all of us are feeling as we fuel our vehicles is particularly acute in louisville
6520747 research shows fuel prices 30 to 40 cents a gallon higher than in neighboring counties as overall prices climb that gap has widened it is time that we get to the bottom of it
6520748 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6520749 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6520750 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6520751 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6520752 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6520753 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6520754 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6520755 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6520756 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6520757 i do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients
6520758 but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a sixteen year old child
6520759 and history is in fact rich in such anti artists in such starvelings of life who necessarily have to take things to themselves impoverish them make them

6520778 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6520779 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6520780 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6520781 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6520782 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6520783 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6520784 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6520785 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6520786 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6520787 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6520788 newsweek is pulling out all the stops to give readers a 360 degree view of the politics the pageantry and the players
6520789 we have already experienced some amazing firsts with virgin galactic since our appointment last july enabling us to give our clients first hand knowledge of the whole virgin galactic experience including a simulated trip into space in the nastar centers space training centrifugal simulator where we achieved g forces upwards of 3gs a private unveiling of the spacecraft models in new york back in january with richard branson and burt rutan and now the unveiling of eve
6520790 as usual burt and the scaled team have created a beauty and this is a very proud day for us all the rollout of whiteknighttwo takes the virgin galactic vision to the next level and continues to provide tangible evidence that this most ambitious of projects is not only for real but is making tremendous progress towards our goal of safe commercial operation we are naming it eve after my mother eve branson but also because it represents a first and a new beginning the chance for our ever growing group of future astronauts and other scientists and payload specialists to see our world in a completely new light i for one cant wait
6520791 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo
6520792 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6520793 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6520794 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6520795 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6520796 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6520797 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6520798 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6520799 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6520800 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6520801 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6520802 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6520803 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6520804 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6520805 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6520806 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6520807 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6520808 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6520809 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6520810 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6520811 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6520812 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6520813 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6520814 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6520815 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6520816 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6520817 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6520818 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6520819 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6520820 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6520821 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6520822 we are thrilled to partner with sun rich international for our championship firestone indy lights race in september
6520823 having a chicago based company like sun rich make a commitment to chicagoland speedway emphasizes the strong interest our sport has built in the countrys third largest market
6520824 as a chicago based company we couldnt feel there is a better fit for sun rich international than a pivotal local event like the indy lights race

6520837 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6520838 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6520839 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6520840 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6520841 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6520842 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6520843 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off

6520851 two years ago obama bought a mansion on the south side in the kenwood neighborhood from a doctor on the same day antoin tony rezkos wife rita rezko bought the vacant lot next door from the same seller the doctor had listed the properties for sale together he sold the house to obama for 300 000 below the asking price the doctor got his asking price on the lot from rezkos wife
6520852 on the same day obama closed on his house rezkos wife bought the adjacent empty lot meeting the condition of the seller who wanted to sell both properties at the same time
6520853 later the obamas bought a 10 foot by 150 foot piece of the lot for 104 500 an appraisal put the value of the strip at 40 500 a spokesman said but obama considered it fair to pay one sixth of the original price for one sixth of the lot
6520854 a federal jury today convicted developer antoin tony rezko of corruption charges for trading on his clout as a top adviser and fundraiser to gov rod blagojevich rezkos guilty verdict on 16 of 24 corruption counts could have broad repercussions for blagojevich who made rezko a central player in his kitchen cabinet it could also prove a political liability for u s sen barack obama who once counted rezko as a friend and fundraiser as the likely democratic presidential nominee heads into the general election campaign against republican john mccain the jury convicted rezko of wire and mail fraud money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery he was acquitted of attempted extortion
6520855 when obama and his wife michelle a hospital executive decided to move with their two young girls from their hyde park condominium they chose a spacious three story georgian revival home on a tree lined street in the kenwood neighborhood not far from the university of chicago the owner had listed the house nearly 100 years old with four fireplaces and a wine cellar and an adjacent lot as separate parcels
6520856 as a state senator barack obama wrote letters to city and state officials supporting his political patron tony rezkos successful bid to get more than 14 million from taxpayers to build apartments for senior citizens
6520857 obamas letters written nearly nine years ago for the first time show the democratic presidential hopeful did a political favor for rezko a longtime friend campaign fund raiser and client of the law firm where obama worked who was indicted last fall on federal charges that accuse him of demanding kickbacks from companies seeking state business under gov blagojevich
6520858 the letters appear to contradict a statement last december from obama who told the chicago tribune that in all the years hes known rezko ive never done any favors for him
6520859 one of them was sen barack obama d ill who was offered a job by rezko in the early 1990s while a top student at harvard law school obama did not take it but over the years the two men stayed in touch
6520860 for the first time sen barack obama put a figure friday to the amount of campaign contributions that indicted political fund raiser tony rezko raised for the senators campaigns and the number about 250 000 was far more than he previously acknowledged
6520861 wed obama and rezko continue to have lunches or breakfasts wed talk about politics wed talk about family
6520862 in terms of other than lunch or breakfast he and i had socially michelle and i probably had a couple of dinners or two or three dinners with rezko and his wife during the course of this six or seven or eight years
6520863 barack and michelle obama visited their home in lake geneva once for the day

6520881 jetzt werden die innenminister sich untereinander nicht mehr trauen k nnen
6520882 w hrend der vergangenen herbstkonferenz der innenminister wurde zwischen senator ehrhart k rting und dem damaligen hamburger amtskollegen nagel die absprache getroffen kollegen nach berlin zur ckholen zu wollen
6520883 man darf bei der diskussion nicht au er acht lassen dass die vom land berlin ausgebildeten 502 beamten von hamburg als vollwertige vollzugsbeamte bernommen wurden ohne dass die hansestadt sich wenigstens anteilig an den kosten f r diese ausbildung beteiligt h tte dass herr glietsch sich jetzt auch vielleicht gegen die meinung einzelner mitarbeiter f r das anschreiben entschlossen hat ist aufgrund dieser grundlage durchaus nachvollziehbar
6520884 es gibt bereits ger chte wonach ein bestimmtes bundesland einer vielzahl von bewerbern f r den gehobenen dienst empfohlen hat sich mangels eigener ausbildungsm glichkeiten in berlin zum polizisten schulen zu lassen um nach erfolgreichem durchlauf der ausbildung in das eigene land zur ckzukehren
6520885 somit w rde das finanzielle ruinierte berlin die polizeiausbildung anderer bundesl nder finanzieren ohne selbst davon profitieren zu k nnen
6520886 polizeipr sident glietsch kann auch nur die stellen besetzen und die geh lter zahlen die ihm von der politik bewilligt werden das land hamburg hat davon profitiert dass wir keine freien stellen hatten die hansestadt hat 500 gute beamte quasi auf dem silbertablett serviert bekommen
6520887 wenn hamburg uns nun davon nur sieben zur ckgeben will ist es nur clever vom pr sidenten weitere zu k dern zumal es sich bei den 21 betroffenen um kollegen handelt die ernste gr nde f r eine r ckkehr haben

6520899 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6520900 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6520901 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6520902 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6520903 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6520904 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6520905 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6520906 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program

6520930 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6520931 the lhc is a discovery machine we dont know what well find
6520932 im actually hoping we find something unexpected that does the job of the higgs
6520933 weve been debating this for 30 years and one way or another the lhc will definitively tell us how electroweak symmetry breaking occurs thats a fundamental advance
6520934 its a tough game you can only do it by statistical analysis since there are other known processes that produce events that can mimic a higgs boson signal
6520935 by itself the higgs is a very puzzling particle so there have been a lot of conjectures about some kind of new physics beyond the standard model supersymmetry has the easiest time fitting in with what we know
6520936 initially well be looking for things that are known standards to make sure that everything is working properly in 2009 we could start really looking for new things like supersymmetry
6520937 these large projects take such a long time we have to start early
6520938 weve been operating it and looking at cosmic ray particles
6520939 nature gives us these cosmic rays for free and theyre the same kinds of particles well see when the machine turns on so it enables us to check out certain aspects of the detector but were very excited to start seeing collisions from the machine
6520940 well be throwing away a lot of data so we have to make sure the triggers are working correctly
6520941 the graduate students and postdocs get to go to geneva but even the undergraduates get a chance to work in a real physics lab and be part of a major international experiment
6520942 there is a high level of interaction and camaraderie between theorists and experimentalists at ucsc which is not the case at other leading institutions
6520943 for me its valuable just in terms of being aware of whats happening on the experimental side
6520944 if nothing were found beyond what we know today that would be so radical because it would be in violation of a lot of extremely fundamental principles
6520945 the poor economic conditions have created a very different and difficult dynamic for us this year and we werent confident that we could present a show experience that was consistent with the successes of prior years

6520950 we were amazed at the diversity of dancers we found in each of our audition cities
6520951 they inspired us with their passion for dance and their determination to become canadas favourite dancer we know viewers will fall in love with them

6520954 and its nice to see gaming center stage like this but
6520955 whats becoming quite apparent is that the way you actually have an impact on health development and poverty alleviation is when people adopt certain behaviours
6520956 its just a matter of getting them to understand that what is a long established habit is in fact harmful and that you can do something about it
6520957 we actually use shame we go into communities and say to people do you realise how faecally contaminated your community is
6520958 we do walks of shame where you take a group of people and you walk around and you say look heres some human faeces here and somebody else has had a shit there and you do this community mapping where everybody comes and says where they defecate
6520959 and you get them to realise how disgusting this is to live in an environment that is totally contaminated
6520960 families were spending money on treating diarrhoea and other diseases but would not spend money on installing a toilet because they expected to be given money for that by aid groups
6520961 we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counterproductive
6520962 we urge the federal government to fully respect the well founded principles of conscientious objection
6520963 as humans we constantly incorporate other peoples current actions as clues cues as to what they may do in the future
6520964 for instance we have a sixth sense on the highway to know that a certain car will swerve into our lane soon based on the drivers current driving patterns then we may become more defensive in our own driving in our work we wanted to begin the process of allowing robots to use behavioral cues of humans or other robots to make the robots mission more reliable and accurate in social work environments populated by numerous people and robots these types of cues should be abundant
6520965 in the future we hope to explore relevant behavioral cues for other robot tasks in human robot work environments and work on the robotics and computer science tools needed to make effective use of those cues
6520966 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6520967 there is no residue theres nothing left and certainly no radioactivity left
6520968 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6520969 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
6520970 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited
6520971 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s
6520972 this report is a one stop shop document that can guide us toward ensuring that we get clean safe water to canadians wherever they choose to live
6520973 the fact that theyre even taking this close a look at this issue is good news in my mind because theyve been away from the fresh water scene for so long
6520974 what were seeing is a bit of a belated catch up in canada to the surge in global food prices we saw earlier this year
6520975 because even with the pullback in grain prices theyre still well up from a year ago
6520976 some of that strength in grain prices earlier this year was for real
6520977 partly its just a matter of food companies making sure that its not just a fluke thats going to be quickly reversed
6520978 grain prices make up only a small share about two per cent of the actual final food price
6520979 unfortunately canadians are going to be experiencing continued pressure on food prices in the future
6520980 earlier this year we were faced by just some astronomical unprecedented commodity price increases
6520981 weve seen some relief in the area of wheat pricing its only double what it was last year versus being triple or quadruple the price
6520982 we are big users of both electricity and natural gas as well as producing a fresh product our industry has trucks on the road everyday delivering
6520983 when you look at energy in total theres been significant pressure on all forms of energy but the most acute of late has been transportation costs
6520984 packaging if its plastic its petroleum based so theres been pressures there
6520985 were starting to see the results of all those inflationary price pressures materialize at the retail level
6520986 mind you we still have an incredibly incredibly competitive retail environment
6520987 so just how much of that pressure will materialize at the retail level thats something for the market to decide
6520988 its possible that some of the grain prices we saw earlier this year were in bubble territory
6520989 is that even with a short pullback theyre still in some cases double where they were a year ago
6520990 were faced with on the agriculture side increasing demand worldwide and significant challenges with supply so prices go up
6520991 two people in town i shared what was going on with them and they offered a home where i could live for free until i get back on my feet
6520992 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6520993 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6520994 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6520995 im sure its disappointing in the williams household to see this draw
6520996 its kind of the way its been happening for me this olympics
6520997 this olympics is the jamaican olympics no disrespect to the americans
6520998 dominating like we are its no surprise i know its been crazy because weve been on the podium a lot
6520999 they brought their a game i dont know where we left ours its packed somewhere in my suitcase i forgot to dig it out weve got to go find it though

6521036 many managers who view themselves as the heroic guardians of shareholder interests the no nonsense tough as nails guys who run their businesses by the numbers who pride themselves on their hypercompetitiveness and who think that
6521037 the most successful organizations understand that the purpose of any business is to create value for customers employees and investors and that the interests of these three groups are inextricably linked
6521038 why do managers so often choose not to focus on value creation and instead make decisions that systematically decrease the long term value of their businesses
6521039 this approach is based on win lose or zero sum thinking the underlying assumption is that there is a fixed pie of value to be divided up among customers employees and investors so the interests of the three groups must be traded off against one another
6521040 companies that act on this myopic conception of self interest may stumble into a downward spiral of poor decision making that is difficult to reverse
6521041 alternatively if managers define their companys interests broadly enough to include the interests of customers and employees an equally powerful spiral of value creation can occur
6521042 an expanding the pie approach to management requires that a company alter its thinking along several dimensions

6521256 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6521257 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6521258 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6521259 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6521260 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6521261 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6521262 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6521263 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6521264 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6521265 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6521266 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6521267 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6521268 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6521269 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6521270 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6521271 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6521272 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6521273 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6521274 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6521275 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6521276 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6521277 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6521278 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6521279 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6521280 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6521281 work the ball down the flanks cross it in high and pray someone heads it in

6521283 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus

6521288 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6521289 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6521290 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6521291 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6521292 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6521293 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6521294 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6521295 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6521296 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6521297 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6521298 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6521299 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6521300 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6521301 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6521302 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6521303 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6521304 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6521305 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6521306 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6521307 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6521308 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6521309 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6521310 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6521311 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6521312 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone

6521314 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

6521316 everything they have done up until now has been an effort to clear the issues of the past
6521317 you could say mulligans appointment is another step in that direction
6521318 we are putting a team together that we expect will take the company forward with the implementation of a new strategic focus peggy is an important part of that team
6521319 the only thing cool about me is that im from hawaii

6521326 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6521327 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county

6521336 notorious for his efforts to control all uses of his material on and off the internet
6521337 the dmca already requires copyright owners to make an initial review of the potentially infringing material prior to sending a takedown notice
6521338 a consideration of the applicability of the fair use doctrine simply is part of that initial review

6521342 no se espera un cambio significativo de intensidad mientras el ojo del sistema se desplaza hacia el interior
6521343 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6521344 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6521345 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6521346 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6521347 this is a planning took where all things are going
6521348 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6521349 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6521350 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6521351 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6521352 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6521353 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6521354 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6521355 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6521356 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6521357 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6521358 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6521359 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6521360 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6521361 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6521362 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

6521371 i was close enough and i heard a couple of conversations now that i know what i know i dont really think that paul really went after her for anything
6521372 she had basically nothing she had tapes of her being in the studio with him her being on the road with him private moments
6521373 she told me a bunch of stuff but i dont see him being a violent person
6521374 my child loves me and needs me my wife girlfriend loves me and needs outta here
6521375 in petty incidents often where the abuse is mutual or it is unclear who the aggressor was
6521376 i spent three days as a juror in a case in which it seemed obvious early on that no conviction could possibly result
6521377 a woman had called 911 complaining her fianc had been drinking and pushed her onto their bed the defendant claimed he held her arms to keep her from hitting him with a phone the next day the woman phoned police and the district attorneys office asking that her fianc not be prosecuted
6521378 she stated that she had overreacted and that she would do anything she could to stop the prosecution nonetheless the case proceeded
6521379 the only other witness the prosecution had was a policeman who had heard the womans original complaint part of his testimony was contradicted by facts that could be ascertained from the 911 recording in the jury room some of us speculated about why this case had ever been brought to court
6521380 breaking down barriers that prevent people and ideas from connecting
6521381 there are high expectations for the closing ceremony after the amazing spectacle we saw at the opening ceremony
6521382 i went to the dress rehearsal the other day witnessed more of zhang yimous unbelievable creative vision ive been sworn to secrecy but i will say that this will be another visual extravaganza featuring a cast of 6 800 on an unprecedented scale even with the high expectations it will not disappoint
6521383 its the nuttiest sport youve ever seen it looks like everybody in the race has stolen a womans handbag and theyre running away over bushes and into their neighbors little plastic pools

6521400 its important for our fellow citizens to understand when you think patriot act constitutional guarantees are in place when it comes to doing what is necessary to protect our homeland because we value the constitution
6521401 the power of the executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers is in the highest degree odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian government whether nazi or communist
6521402 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile it is morally treasonable to the american public

6521541 its better to say that 60 of the content we share with nrc handelsblad they also take content from us sport stories for example appear most of the time first in the morning paper nrc next the rest is produced exclusively for nrc next by the 24 new journalists and the 180 staff of nrc handelsblad and freelancers for example this week a staffer of nrc handelsblad produced an article about a new fitness machine for nrc next why her because she happens to know a lot about these type of machines and we asked her most articles on the mainstream news issues politics foreign affairs economics etc we share with nrc handelsblad but if these subjects are coverstories we have one leading cover story everyday we often ask editors of nrc handelsblad to write them especially for us why sometimes our focus is different example after the proclamation of the death penalty against saddam hussein we asked for a story about the death penalty and the legitimacy of the trial are we suddenly in favor of the death penalty now that saddam gets it not about iraq
6521542 yes although our paper is focused on analysis what the news means we bring a selection of news to start with our deadline is 11 15 pm sunday tuesday and 10 45 pm wednesday and thursday that is early this week it was too early there was a political crisis in the country and the prime minister came up with his final press conference at midnight why are we printed so early we share printing presses with other older newspapers that are still bigger than us so we have to go first
6521543 believe it or not the costs of shared resources are not really split we are 100 percent part of nrc handelsblad bv and we are all on the same pay list we use the same computers etc we are considered the morning edition of nrc handelsblad yes we have our own budget for travel costs and freelancers etc but so has the friday and saturday supplements of nrc handelsblad there is only one extra rule and that rule considers freelancers if their story is published in both papers the paper where the story is first published that is the paper that asked for the story pays the fee the other paper pays the freelancer 10 percent of that fee for the second publication of his story
6521544 we work to more than one deadline also the production of nrc next is much more centralised it is more like a magazine we take into account all the pages together and is perfectly possible that home has to skip an interview because international already has one rhythm and images are important the disadvantage is that journalist sometimes have to work very very long days the advantage is that a small new paper like ours has foreign correspondents a science desk etc the advantage is that you get a better product but is probably only works well if you have a small staff
6521545 very good they were happy that something was happening instead of just laying off journalists as happens elsewhere before nrc next started there was also scepticism will anybody buy this new newspaper will it spoil our brand name nrc by being too populistic and simplistic now that nrc next exists these fears have disappeared they are happy to see their stories printed twice and in color in different format and often presented more lively if we rewrite we always try to do that with the authors knowledge what they are not happy about and rightly so are the sometimes longer working hours
6521546 because we give added value news is for free analysis background and all kind of great stories that you cannot find elswere are not nrc next is a nice product with status it has quality when a newspaper is free it is for everybody i am not everybody i am special so i read nrc next compare it to the ipod that is much more expensive than any other mp3 player but still much more in vogue as far as the website is concerned at this moment there is only a general nrc website which has a different look and feel the nrcnext nl starts next year we hope to reach a new audience with that

6521635 with more than 90 per cent of all traffic generated on the internet coming from search engines it is important for the local business community to identify various ways of utilizing these internet tools to achieve the desired visibility for their businesses
6521636 there is a huge gap between demand for information and the supply of relevant content in the business arena there are people who are desperately looking for certain products and services but unable to find relevant links because business offerings are not available online or at least not visible on search engines as an essential marketing tool for businesses search engine marketing has become one of the worlds most preferred marketing strategies due to its flexibility accessibility accuracy and cost effectiveness
6521637 i got a call late last night telling me the sad news and it was something that was a shock to me but it was something also that s probably indicative of the way gene led his life he was very quiet and very strong willed and pride was a word that i always associated with him he went his own way my thoughts and prayers are with terri and the kidshaven t given any thought to that i look at gene as just a terrific man who s provided such great leadership to his players it s obviously something that we ll have to deal with but i m certain that his legacy and his leadership will live on and hopefully that will be kept strong in everyone s mind as we go forward and face the issues we need to face going forward
6521638 gene was a guy that had so much respect for the game his love of the game really dictated everything as it related to how he approached issues he fought hard for his players he was fair and he was respectful to everybody the thing i always remember about gene is he always treated me as an individual somebody with whom he had a good relationship and he did that with everybody that i saw i think that s something that will be a legacy at least for me as it relates to gene upshaw
6521639 it was just like when i played in the super bowl with the philadelphia eagles i told the coach if i am on the football field to treat me as if i am 100 percent i don t think they were considering what i did in the game i felt like i could have done more
6521640 why receivers are the ones creating so much controversy in the nfl
6521641 i dont think it would be productive for our football team you have to be a productive part to be an nfl player and theres responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege its not a right theres a lot that comes with being an nfl football player
6521642 i got a quarterback and a son in one day
6521643 if i lose the light of the sun i will write by candlelight moonlight no light if i lose paper and ink i will write in blood on forgotten walls i will write always i will capture nights all over the world and bring them to you
6521644 the average is the borderline that keeps mere men in their place
6521645 theyre taking it slow because her twin brother hunter is busy working on barack obamas campaign scarlett who also supports the presidential hopeful wants to hold off until the election is over because hunter is so busy
6521646 theres so much pressure to look a certain way and i dont fit the convention but its okay if youre not the perfect picture
6521647 everyone can feel out of place but its not about whether youre popular or nerdy as long as youre comfortable with yourself and your friends and family love you thats all that matters
6521648 oh you are so precious with your little toddle of a walk but would you please slow down mommys not ready for you to grow up yet

6521660 le puedo jurar como comandante por mi palabra de honor que para mi resultar a m s ben fico que alias c sar hubiera recibido 20 millones y eso hubiera sido demoledor al interior de las farc eso hubiera sido un incentivo
6521661 pagar un secuestro es darle m s razones a las guerrillas para que sigan secuestrando
6521662 what amazes me is the huge range of the discoveries that have come from sdss data
6521663 we designed it primarily as a survey to map the distribution of galaxies and quasars but its also had a huge impact on the study of stars the structure of our own galaxy and even solar system objects
6521664 im at a small state university and while i did my dissertation on galaxies when i landed at a state school i thought id never be able to do this study galaxies again because i dont have access to a large telescope but because of the sloan digital sky survey and because of the easy to use tools where i can say to my undergraduate students go find all the data on these clusters its possible for people at small schools to do amazing amazing research and explore the entire universe
6521665 visible light is where we understand the universe best but when we began the sdss there were no sensitive well characterized visible light catalogs that covered a large area of sky
6521666 now we have multi color images of 300 million celestial objects 3 dimensional maps and detailed properties of well over a million of them and its all publicly available online that changes everything
6521667 no seas ingenuo muchacho tu cabeza es la trinchera y el voto es tu herramienta

6521676 aimed specifically at the extreme gamer category three tiers of the acer aspire predator are in stores right now ranging from around 4 000 8 000 depending on just how big you want your e peen to be this is the top end of the spectrum pushing the latest and greatest tech from 4 hotswap hard drives slots to space for 8gb of ram sli graphics and liquid cooling all of which is a albeit expensive gift to the wants and needs of overclockers and tweakers
6521677 while the acer predator doesnt quite compete with the next gen consoles it is existence is further proof that there is a danger for the xbox 720 and ps4 out there

6521680 las instituciones colombianas no est n podridas ni vendidas a la santa mata de fua no flaquea su democracia como lopez michelsen tanto a oraba y tampoco son sus instituciones un trampol n para arribistas maleducados el gobierno s lo ejerce persuasiones necesarias para la seguridad nacional
6521681 intercept la liberaci n programada para este fin de semana o el pr ximo
6521682 la liberaci n estaba programada para este fin de semana o el pr ximo seg n hab a acordado el secretariado y el propio alfonso cano por eso se daba el reagrupamiento las fuerzas armadas se enteraron e interceptaron la liberaci n para hacer creer que se trataba de un rescate
6521683 cada vez que se ha quedado en lago con los franceses y los suizos ha ocurrido algo por lo tanto aunque se sigue buscando el canje humanitario ya no habr m s conversaciones en el operativo de ingrid betancourt pusieron en riesgo la vida de los detenidos por lo tanto ahora las cosas deben cambiar
6521684 hicieron una campa a medi tica para mostrar al mundo que tanto la se ora betancourt como los otros detenidos estaban en p simas condiciones de salud ahora est demostrado que han tenido un trato mucho m s humano que el que reciben nuestros presos en las c rceles del estado ser a bueno que los medios de comunicaci n y la onu accedan a ver las condiciones en que est n la mayor a de nuestros presos
6521685 la extracci n de las farc les hace mantener humildes ahora ser muy f cil que hablen contra las farc incluso sus amigos pero la lucha de las farc no termina con un suceso como ste no termin tras diversas embestidas que han sufrido a lo largo de la historia no termin cuando mataron a m s de 5 000 compa eros de la uni n patri tica y no terminar ahora que el narco para gobierno de alvaro uribe y la oligarqu a colombiana no se embriaguen con este supuesto triunfo
6521686 el futuro de colombia no puede ser y no ser la guerra civil por eso es necesario que los pa ses de am rica latina jueguen un papel activo para llevar a un di logo que culmine en la paz
6521687 deja un ligero sabor a duda el papel de los pa ses amigos en esta operaci n militar con asalto a la confianza de una de las partes o de las dos no lo sabemos

6521694 la mayor parte de las personas viven en un c rculo muy restringido de su ser potencial s lo utilizan una peque a parte de los recursos totales de su conciencia y de su alma es como un hombre que hubiera permanecido separado de su organismo corporal global y se hubiera acostumbrado a mover y utilizar tan s lo el dedo me ique
6521695 hay algo en mi que puede decir cosas que yo mismo ignoro y van m s all de mis intenciones
6521696 ad nde ad nde fui eso es lo que me pregunta todo el mundo aunque mi cuerpo estaba inm vil mi cerebro me llev a otra dimensi n de la existencia a otro universo la parte f sica del ser ya no tiene nada que hacer all como el esp ritu que abandona el cuerpo despu s de la muerte como la mariposa que sale de su capullo mi conciencia estaba constituida por energ a ps quica no por mi cuerpo f sico
6521697 durante las horas que dur esto observ que cada vez que acababa una muerte comenzaba otra enseguida
6521698 si alguien hab a muerto de c ncer yo sent a ese terrible dolor si hab a sufrido un infarto padec a esos mismos efectos
6521699 estoy plenamente convencido de que la conciencia es algo m s que un mero producto accidental de los procesos neurofisiol gicos y bioqu micos que tienen lugar en el cerebro humano en mi opini n la conciencia y el psiquismo humanos son reflejos y expresiones de una inteligencia c smica que impregna la totalidad de universo y la existencia entera no s lo somos animales altamente evolucionados que disponemos de computadores biol gicos alojados en el interior del cr neo sino que tambi n somos campos de conciencia ilimitados que trascendemos el tiempo el espacio la materia y la causalidad lineal
6521700 during their extreme growth mode which was too ambitious they took on some leases at the wrong price and wrong location

6521708 como saberlo acaso hemos tenido otra opci n a estos gobiernos
6521709 certainly as we age there are declines with brain functions and cognition but theres evidence that the aging brain can adapt and change more than we ever thought
6521710 we dont know how it happens or how long changes last but even in the face of these unanswered questions there is the chance to maintain our cognitive function
6521711 i think that as the years go on im getting to be a better driver than you youre so old and im so young and youre getting older but i use anti aging products like flax booster juice im not so much getting older youre going to be 100 soon and im only going to be 30 you keep making mistakes all the time and i keep getting better you never used to make so many driving errors have i mentioned how very old you are
6521712 dont tell me how to drive i know how to freakin slow down wait is it the pedal on the left or the one on the right if you try to dictate my every move like you always do you will be driving i will pull this van over right now and you will drive and you will not be able to prepare
6521713 oh my goodness i passing this guy and im still not breaking the speed limit thats when you know youre going too slow
6521714 you should always go as fast as you can when passing get out of that lane as fast as you can blah blah blah
6521715 are you telling me how to drive are you telling me stuff that any dummy would know because i know how to pass a vehicle theres no traffic coming this guy is going so slow that i was able to pass him quickly and not break the speed limit geez you know it is a miracle that you let me drive our children around at all thank you so much for petitioning the lord every day on our behalf because surely without that i would have killed them by now if you tell me one more time how to drive you will be driving
6521716 okay i have never done that before i swear right kids have i ever done that before the many times ive taken you on the highway
6521717 see that was not me that was the lord humbling me ive never done that and i wont do it again ahem
6521718 it makes it hard to feel sympathetic towards their plights
6521719 you knew that i would fall for you like an eagle moving in for the kill
6521720 you asked me a question i gave you an answer
6521721 he didnt care about popularity he cared about success for our troops and our country and now that the surge has worked it proves that johns judgment was correct
6521722 i am an only child i am an only child and the money is all mine
6521723 theres a perception out there that coal is dirty and we have to change that
6521724 not someone owen theres nobody else that could have done this
6521725 it is more pure than leading brands of bottled water
6521726 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6521727 if its not done in 10 years they would have to session in the olympic stadium
6521728 favor vel a qualquer medida que tenha por fim dar maior seguran a aos seus habitantes em especial ao eleitor aos candidatos e imprensa para que o processo eleitoral transcorra em um ambiente de tranq ilidade e garantia de plena liberdade do exerc cio da cidadania e o do direito informa o
6521729 dentro de suas possibilidades todos est o ajudando muito a resposta vem sendo muito positiva
6521730 o time entrou em campo muito decidido desde a ltima conversa que tivemos senti esse clima de decis o por isso todos entraram em campo muito antentos
6521731 este paro c vico como de costumbre pretende ser impuesto a la poblaci n que tiene sus negocios adem s a quienes decidieron desarrollar su trabajo de manera normal ya que tienen que llevar el pan de cada d a a sus hogares
6521732 esta medida s lo busca satisfacer los intereses de unos cuantos por eso no nos beneficia en nada y no lo apoyamos
6521733 it will encourage other countries of the region and beyond to follow suit

6521735 apoyar este paro es respaldar a los terratenientes y los grandes millonarios de santa cruz nosotros los trabajadores tenemos que trabajar todos los d as si queremos comer por lo tanto hoy fue un d a de trabajo normal
6521736 si los ni os vienen a la escuela no podemos cerrarles las puertas y por ello trabajaron normalmente

6521738 la aver a reparada no influy para nada en el accidente
6521739 la aver a que fue reparada por los t cnicos de mantenimiento de spanair no influy para nada en el accidente
6521740 si como he podido leer el piloto solicit por segunda vez una revisi n c mo se le puede negar y obligarlo a despegar c mo spanair puede decir que el calentamiento de un motor no es motivo para abortar el vuelo cuando se ha terminado incendiando
6521741 no es as no sabemos si el piloto fue obligado cosa que no puedo creer porque el piloto es el que decide en ltima instancia detect un error s lo una vez cuando sali a la pista fue un fallo menor y reparado
6521742 habr a que valorar tambi n si fue un problema interno del motor que no se detect antes del despegue
6521743 no fue nada que tuviera que ver en el accidente
6521744 la aver a fue detectada por los elementos que est n en la cabina por se ales luminosas o sonoras volvi al parking fue reparada no hubo negligencia y menos por el t cnico que dio el visto bueno

6521747 we have a once in a generation chance to bring meaningful and lasting change to our country by electing barack obama president and sending a stronger democratic majority to the senate
6521748 we need a stronger majority in the senate to enact obamas broad sweeping agenda and our outstanding group of candidates is ready to deliver it
6521749 france is resolved to pursue the fight against terrorism for democracy and liberty the cause is just it is the honor of france and its armies to defend it
6521750 gun battles with the taliban are down fifty per cent this year
6521751 it is better for my children if they live even if they have to be illiterate
6521752 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
6521753 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
6521754 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
6521755 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
6521756 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
6521757 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
6521758 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine
6521759 high energy prices have led to an increase in biodiesel production which in turn has led to an increase in the amount of crude glycerol in the market
6521760 we have shown that it is possible to use the crude glycerol byproduct from the biodiesel industry as a carbon source for microalgae that produce omega 3 fatty acids
6521761 after thorough chemical analysis we have also shown that the algae biomass composition has the same quality as the commercial algae product
6521762 the fish fed the algae had significant amounts of omega 3 fatty acids
6521763 production of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid from biodiesel waste glycerol by microalgal fermentation agfd 272
6521764 i dont know a single independent in the area thats able to offer health insurance
6521765 standard of living across the board is going down and im working more
6521766 we know that al qaeda still has a meaningful presence in the mosul area and parts of western ninevah and the tigris river valley
6521767 thats useful to know but that encompasses a couple of million people
6521768 it was a big deal in that it truly showed there was foreign fighter traffic in the western jazeera really it was a couple of computer systems it was effectively a travel office for al qaeda it was heres where you pick up your papers heres where you pick up your travel itinerary heres where you are going here are the safe houses where you stay along the way
6521769 we do not have an extensive presence in the western jazeera not even the iraqi army does but the flip side is that an insurgency or even terrorism needs populated areas in order to thrive in the desert all you can do is train
6521770 there is now a perception among the average iraqis that al qaeda is a bad thing which is the reason for the islamic state in iraq to put an iraqi face on an insurgency so it appeared to have a nationalist tone
6521771 we were able to bring together some of the negotiators and perpetrators from the apartheid years in south africa to discuss the difficult yet peaceful transition from apartheid to democracy
6521772 after four days of breaking bread and seeing how people from divided societies could be civil and discuss many issues together it made a dramatic impression
6521773 so that people would relax and get to know each other
6521774 the three of us formed a committee to make the idea a reality
6521775 as you can imagine there were many hurdles we had to overcome including finding a country where the group could safely meet the support of finlands crisis management initiative was critical in helping us to manage these difficult logistics
6521776 our goal is to provide an atmosphere for discussion so that differences can be resolved
6521777 the facilitators facilitate they dont mediate the iraqi representatives are the ones who determine the agenda goals and processes
6521778 at the very top level they are giants in this field as big as you can get
6521779 the goal now will be to implement the principles they have agreed on and keep the discussions going
6521780 and to make that vision realizable he was prepared to put whatever amount of money it cost to make it possible hes the living embodiment of what a moral life is
6521781 america has been very good to my family in many ways and you just need to give back to society
6521782 the mosque foundation provides a welcoming worshipful environment where both men and women may pray with peace of mind and a sense of home
6521783 among the leaders at the bridgeview mosque are men who have condemned western culture praised palestinian suicide bombers and encouraged members to view society in stark terms muslims against the world
6521784 despite a relatively good spring harvest in june july which was comparable to last years harvest at the same time food security conditions are still precarious prices for staple food crops rice corn beans and sorghum remain high high world market prices for oil and grain are preventing improvements in food security in spite of recent harvests some 2 3 million haitians particularly residents of relatively arid areas of the northwest and northeast and of poor urban areas are currently categorized as moderately to acutely food insecure the southern peninsula including the nippes grandanse southern and southeastern regions which is especially vulnerable to hurricanes has also been classified as food insecure
6521785 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6521786 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6521787 redoubling efforts to bring it a deal to a final conclusion
6521788 it has taken us a very long time but we are very very close to close this agreement
6521789 still issues concerning exactly how our forces will operate i think that is only natural at this point
6521790 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timeline aspirational timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe and what is reasonable
6521791 this visit is a bad omen for iraq it represents american dictatorship that rejects iraqs sovereignty

6521794 i think people are really ready not only in the primary election but in the general election for someone who represents an independent voice i think that really carried the day
6521795 my chances to get out and about were pretty limited
6521796 you have to give him credit he worked extremely hard
6521797 where soil phosphorous levels are low 10 20 parts per million mehlich iii or bray 1 p or very low less than 10 ppm the likelihood of a wheat yield response to phosphorous is greater than 50 percent
6521798 often the yield response is great enough to more than pay for the phosphorous fertilizer even at today s prices
6521799 early season phosphorous deficiency can limit wheat yield potential the first five to six weeks after emergence is the critical period
6521800 wheat absorbs about 18 percent of its total seasonal phosphorus uptake in just the first two weeks of growth
6521801 it doesn t take much added phosphorous fertilizer with the proper timing and placement to have a big effect on early season development and yields
6521802 the men and women of the oregon state police officers association have seen jeff merkley go to bat for law enforcement
6521803 this endorsement demonstrates their belief that he will do what it takes to protect our kids and families
6521804 failed to fund 24 7 police coverage of the i 5 corridor needed to help combat meth trafficking
6521805 he was very helpful for us in the last legislative session trying to get bipartisan support for the state police
6521806 i have a good story id like to contribute file under anonymous i cant be sure if everyone is familiar with
6521807 my story begins with a friend a few years older than me
6521808 just as they get under way in the jeep one man in back with an assault rifle and also passenger heavily armed they notice something just inside the brush tree line making pace with the vehicle
6521809 this is the best part they all report huge red glowing eyes that pierce your soul
6521810 the team that scores the most points will win the game

6521813 u knows b all u there n is t to u know
6521814 i would characterize it as others have which is that weve made good progress on it we are close
6521815 there are still some issues to work out but that its very premature at this point to say that we have an agreement secretary rice is there to work this issue specifically and a lot will be dependent on how well those discussions go
6521816 the conversations that were having with the iraqis now are based on the improvement in security and our mutual desire to bring more american troops home
6521817 i think the president and every american wants to see american troops come home but not until the job is done and there is more security more political progress and more economic progress inside iraq
6521818 the governor will discuss the logistic cooperation with the chinese company especially the security side
6521819 armed with outstanding management teams appropriate capital structures and their own currencies hsni home shopping network ticketmaster interval leisure group and tree com are now ready for independent futures while the internet businesses that make up new iac can operate with a collective purpose and common goals
6521820 the work is done and our focus now is moving forward
6521821 what weve done with this terminal is really kind of a miracle
6521822 were on that last leg of that relay were going to touch that wall shortly and im excited about it

6521825 we are making significant investments to support innovation across california that improves lives by strengthening the safety net improving healthcare quality and reducing teen dating violence
6521826 the arrls response to his queries though lengthy attempts to address them in detail with toms permission we are releasing both his original e mail and the arrls response in order to get the most accurate and full information out to repeater owners and users as possible it also gives us the opportunity to make sure a couple of other issues relating to the pave paws situation that have arisen are brought to the publics attention
6521827 the balance between not being able to know full technical details of the interference and the testing techniques and the desire need to know information its a tough challenge and while there have been a few errors in identifying call signs because of errors in databases being used by the air force there were actual measurements made of signals identified by the air force testing group

6521834 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna
6521835 but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market
6521836 her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it

6521844 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
6521845 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
6521846 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness

6521861 para el pr ximo a o tendremos el tiempo de preparar la forma en c mo el ministerio asumir a el 70 aspiramos que para el 2009 la situaci n sea otra
6521862 la idea era dar una lucha fuerte all pero como estuvo la reforma el a o pasado no quisimos hacer de esto un tema convulsivo y por eso llegamos a unos acuerdos parciales
6521863 nosotros creemos que dentro del marco de la gratuidad de la ense anza es una obligaci n del ministerio establecer que los cursos intensivos sean gratuitos por lo menos con el pago de aranceles o matr culas aspiramos que el pr ximo a o podamos incorporarlos al presupuesto de las universidades
6521864 la aspiraci n que tenemos es que entre los meses septiembre octubre el presidente hugo ch vez anuncie el proceso de transici n de los colegios e institutos a universidades polit cnicas

6521870 ese es un tema que esta comenzando su desarrollo como fue hecho entre gallos y medianoche nos enteramos al d a siguiente que el d a anterior se acababa a habilitante y todos pens bamos que hasta all hab an llegado los poderes del presidente nos sorprenden con estas 26 leyes ahora es que esto empieza a digerirse
6521871 lo que s es cierto es que desde hace alg n tiempo para ac y sobre todo por lo que dice el propio gobierno el presidente ch vez a la gente no le gusta que lo sorprendan con cosas que no le han planteado previamente ese concepto de democracia protag nica y participativa pues la gente de alguna manera lo ha venido internalizando
6521872 la verdad es que la campa a ahora es que comienza pero comienza en un escenario pol tico donde el presidente ch vez ya no es mayor a por lo menos no es una mayor a apabullante como se demostr en algunas otras elecciones
6521873 hay una posibilidad cierta no digamos segura pero una posibilidad cierta de que la oposici n pudiera quitarle la alcald a de caracas o la alcald a mayor al chavismo con leopoldo l pez era una posibilidad mucho m s cierta y mucho m s segura pero con cualquiera de los otros candidatos que est n en la palestra pareciera que tambi n hay posibilidad
6521874 son las leyes cortadas con la misma tijera con la que se construy la reforma
6521875 el presidente viene comiendo flechas mientras el pueblo quiere desarrollar un proyecto que est en la constituci n el presidente viene de all para ac con un proyecto personal
6521876 este movimiento junto a los estudiantes marisabel rodr guez y baduel nos pusimos de pie y dijimos hasta aqu llegamos y nos colocamos al lado de la constituci n y del pueblo venezolano
6521877 en diciembre pasado sucedi lo que ten a que suceder y se esperaba el pueblo obtuvo una contundente victoria sobre el referendo fue una victoria tan contundente que todo el poder constituido hab a sido usada y sin embargo los resultados contundentes todav a no los conocemos pero sabemos que fueron contundentes
6521878 eso al presidente ch vez no le importa todos le escuchamos decir el tipo de victoria que l cree que obtuvo el pueblo hoy cuando hace poco el presidente nos entreg a los venezolano un paquete de 26 leyes no hay sorpresa alguna
6521879 lo que est escrito en estas leyes est hecho a conciencia la verdad es que detr s de todo esto lo que se presenta es un estado concentrador de capital o capitalismo de estado y bien lejos est eso de ser un socialismo moderno como el que se desarrolla en otros pa ses donde la democracia y el respeto a las instituciones es preponderante por encima de cualquier cosa
6521880 son los pobres a los que se est n poniendo al lado de toda participaci n este es el punto principal la participaci n fue reducida a la nada las leyes que produjo el presidente en el marco de la ley habilitante los consejos comunales que tanta expectativa hab a levantado en el pueblo han quedado reducidos a entes del estado
6521881 ahora el presidente es el constituyente y el pueblo es el poder constituido de acuerdo con esas leyes el mundo al rev s el presidente comiendo flechas
6521882 i think its important that both the city and county give volkswagen everything they need
6521883 whether its millions of dollars in improvements to the site or an incentive package twice as big as the one we offered toyota or kia or a constant stream of desperate easily manipulated and affordable workers uninfluenced by costly and pesky union intervention we hope to be able to provide the means for volkswagen to help germany get back on its feet
6521884 we need to give back to them i mean most of them arent nazis any more they deserve our help
6521885 not only will volkswagen employ thousands of people in our area
6521886 but all of the profits that volkswagen makes here in america will go back overseas to help improve germanys economy its a win win situation heck i have even considered applying for a job at the plant myself when i lose the election in march
6521887 like i said a couple of weeks ago kids need to learn that science and learn that math so they can be ready when vw needs them
6521888 it is my sincere hope that more students will decide not to go to college to prepare for jobs that i dont understand but instead pursue a career in sticking parts of cars together at least until volkswagen finds workers wholl do it cheaper somewhere else lets just hope that the dollar stays weak so we can help germany can stay strong
6521889 due to a variety of factors including the steady population growth of our state inflation in the construction industry rescissions in the federal highway funding program and the texas mobility fund reaching its bond capacity our ability to fund needed transportation projects in the future is limited
6521890 la cumbre representa para el salvador la oportunidad de mostrarse al mundo como un pa s en paz y en busca del desarrollo y que ofrecemos much simas oportunidades y ventajas para la inversi n extranjera y para la promoci n del turismo
6521891 based upon the success of last years inaugural scrimmage we are excited to host the event again
6521892 it provides the team an opportunity to play in front of a crowd and most importantly it allows the players to interact with the fans
6521893 the contests are very fun and i look forward to watching them again
6521894 volleyball is a sport that makes personal connections with its fans and the scrimmage provides us with the avenue to establish this as soon as school starts there is not much going on the second night of classes and what else is better to do than receive a free t shirt free pizza win prizes and watch western illinois volleyball
6521895 los cursos intensivos siempre son cancelados por los propios estudiantes ellos se encargan de organizarlos
6521896 este a o quisimos apoyarlos y les pedimos que conformar n una comisi n nacional estudiantil para evaluar los costos
6521897 podemos decir que hasta la fecha la demanda subi a 183 mil estudiantes
6521898 este a o s lo financiamos una materia sin embargo sabemos que hay instituciones que dan varias asignaturas esperamos normar en esta materia
6521899 aspiramos que el pr ximo a o podamos incorporar los cursos intensivos dentro del presupuesto de las universidades
6521900 continuaci n de la pol tica estadounidense de tiempos de la guerra fr a
6521901 quiere apoyos y est dispuesta a pagar y los que se encuentran al margen de la gran pol tica se han agitado
6521902 quisimos ver c mo observaban los venezolanos la gesti n del presidente ch vez se mantiene todav a bastante fuerte alrededor de un 70 considera que ha hecho una buena gesti n
6521903 tambi n quisimos medir cu l es la forma de seleccionar a los candidatos para la municipalidad y la gobernaci n hay un porcentaje muy importante de la poblaci n que considera que tanto la oposici n como el gobierno deben escogerse por elecciones de base a trav s de elecciones directas
6521904 estamos hablando de casi 35 versus casi 28 por ciento de los candidatos de otros sectores esto significa que en algunos casos la diferencia puede ser mayor pero en aquellos que la diferencia sea menor de 5 puntos va a depender mucho de las iniciativas de los candidatos
6521905 el cuestionario es muy uniforme no es muy variable y las respuestas no son muy distintas en relaci n a los problemas urbanos que aparecen en los grandes municipios inseguridad desempleo vialidad basura y uno m s que aparece que es el problema de las aguas tanto potables como servidas
6521906 el desabastecimiento tambi n aparece pero disminuyendo alrededor de un 8 y el desempleo siempre aparece con una variable en una franja entre el 22 y 25

6521928 i think he should show more respect shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones
6521929 i would love him to show more respect to his competitors he should learn that he should shake hands with competitors
6521930 i understand the joy he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived is catch me if you can you dont do that
6521931 he was just enthusiastic very happy and there was never any animosity it was from within

6521942 this shareeah is the straight and correct way anything other than this is the way of those who have earned the wrath of allaah such as the jews the christians and the polytheists
6521943 s ome muslims will deviate to the doctrines of the religion of the jews or that of the christians such deviation is made alluring by satan
6521944 islam is very sensitive about maintaining its purity and the unique identity of its followers to the voluntary recommended fast on the tenth of muharram muslims are required to add another day 9th or 11th to differentiate it from the then prevalent jewish practice muslims are forbidden to emulate the appearance of non muslims
6521945 allaah inflicted his punishment on all the people of the sabbath jews because of what they did they were changed into apes despised and rejected
6521946 since the era of the prophet until today the jews have been conspiring against the muslims and spreading dissension and despair among them so that they may not be able to defend their religion and restore their usurped lands for these reasons the muslims must come to their senses and stand united in the face of this jewish danger and its endless evil goals

6521956 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
6521957 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
6521958 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

6521962 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
6521963 heres one house american cant afford to let john mccain move into
6521964 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6521965 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6521966 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6521967 if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america

6522034 for the first time a court has recognized that a calculated plan by the federal government to undercut state medical marijuana laws is patently unconstitutional todays decision forecasts an end to any organized federal effort to sabotage state medical marijuana laws

6522036 the court made clear that this deliberate interference once proved would be unequivocally unconstitutional

6522253 lobbyists dont come to my office because they know theyre not going to be an earmark they know theyre not going to get a pork barrel project senator obamas gotten lots of em
6522254 lobbyists dont come to my office because they know theyre not going to be an earmark they know theyre not going to get a pork barrel project senator barack obamas gotten lots of em
6522255 called lobbyists birds of prey wednesday and vowed to enforce a lifetime ban on lobbying for members of his administration
6522256 the topic of lobbyists is sensitive for mccain because several of his top aides had lucrative lobbying practices
6522257 neither ms iseman nor any representative of paxson and alcalde and fay personally asked senator mccain to send a letter to the fcc regarding this proceeding
6522258 urg ing the commission to abandon plans to close a loophole vitally important to glencairn ltd a client of vicki iseman a lobbyist
6522259 the provision enabled one of the nations largest broadcasting companies sinclair to use a marketing agreement with glencairn a far smaller broadcaster to get around a restriction barring single ownership of two television stations in the same city
6522260 will become part of our overall review of the commissions functions and structure during the next session of congress
6522261 championed legislation that will let an arizona rancher trade remote grassland and ponderosa pine forest here for acres of valuable federally owned property that is ready for development a land swap that now stands to directly benefit one of his top presidential campaign fundraisers
6522262 the bizarre thing to me regarding mccain is we spent a lot of time with his staff and we all seemed to be on the same page about the problems with this swap but somehow john mccain kept pushing it forward
6522263 released an updated list of his top money collectors on tuesday revealing that nearly a fifth of those who have brought in the largest amounts for him more than 500 000 each are lobbyists or work for firms that engage in lobbying
6522264 whenever theres a corrupt system then youre going to have these birds of prey descend on it to get their share of the spoils
6522265 let me just begin by saying that to save you some time im not going to comment on the vice president
6522266 i point out what my record is which is one that has not won me miss congeniality over the years
6522267 people want change in america we all know that and very legitimately so
6522268 lobbyists dont come to my office because they know theyre not going to be an earmark they know theyre not going to get a pork barrel project senator obamas gotten lots of em
6522269 i would not allow anyone who worked for my administration to go back to lobbying
6522270 senator obama has asked for nearly a billion dollars in earmarked pork barrel projects and he rails against lobbyists ive never taken a single one
6522271 but the fact is that they are the symptom of a disease
6522272 as long as you have earmarking and pork barrel spending and bridges to nowhere and money for dna of bears in montana and museums and all that then youre going to have lobbyists
6522273 so its kind of entertaining to me to attack the lobbyists rather than the source of the problem which is the earmark theyd all be out of business most of em would be out of business if we stopped pork barrel and earmark spending
6522274 i dont think he was ever at peace with it
6522275 it seemed like the garden took precedence over a lot of things

6522315 in a way yes its life but hotter stronger and neater
6522316 what a peculiar way to earn a living do you tell your readers its all made up
6522317 good god no i mean if youd been connected with the other branch of the newspaper game youd probably find it a relief
6522318 but you asked for it you have to understand that newspapers are all more or less in two distinct kinds of business theres the intelligence side you know meat will be dearer tomorrow the president of peru just shot himself bond holders beware that sort of things supposed to be true the other sides the one the moneys in
6522319 right its called human interest and its really a branch of show business non stop vaudeville changed every day and always leave them laughing if you can write revue sketches and begging letters and you can clean up dirty jokes youve got what it takes the only difficult part about it is to get members of the public to take part in your productions
6522320 that is the side that doesnt have to be true
6522321 its of no importance that the mill girl doesnt exist except that it saves me the trouble of convincing some deluded little girl that the things that have to happen to her really did happen it also saves my employer some money
6522322 i havent had a moments peace since that dreadful article was published im a branded man
6522323 terrible trouble they say i must undo some of the harm i have done them before they can offer me any help i cant find any work because everyone seems to have seen your article and as soon as they see my name or my face they turn me away cant you print a little note just a few words to say i wasnt responsible for what appeared in your paper
6522324 the owners of this newspaper are prepared to do almost anything for a reader but one of the things they wont do is deny a story theyve paid money for
6522325 but it would cost you nothing and it might mean a new life for me
6522326 the trouble is it would spoil the gay generous tone of the paper
6522327 i know its hard to follow from your point of view but i assure you thats the case
6522328 ive still got the greater part of your papers money left ive been desperately trying not to spend it hoping that i might be allowed to give it back
6522329 i dont want money all i want is a chance to remove this dreadful brand youve made me a whining sponging hypocritical good for nothing
6522330 i dont think this paper can do anything for you

6522334 the word impossible never exists in bollywood i am sure we will manage to fill the entire arena with our love and undying support for the film industry which we have seen grow with us since our childhood days
6522335 it all goes to show how much has bollywood inspired us over the years its pay back time for us now
6522336 to fill 1 000 2 000 or 5 000 seats isnt a problem weve seen that happen in many shows at the wembley arena
6522337 here we are talking about the o2 its going to be an uphill task
6522338 ive never missed a single bollywood film in the three years since i came to the uk there is just something which attracts me towards bollywood i like the colours the songs the fights the clich d romance the melodrama and last but not least amitabh bachchan
6522339 this man just cannot stop everytime i see big b on screen i learn a lot from him
6522340 the way he sits the way he talks the expression in his eyes and his professionalism is mind blowing
6522341 the first thing that comes to my mind when i hear the name amitabh bachchan is legend ive seen his film sholay many times i am a bit sad because i still havent managed to get my hands on the tickets for the show now i have no option but to buy the vip tickets big b is the only reason ill be buying these tickets
6522342 its bizarre but i am going to dance my way out on all the songs which will be performed by the actors
6522343 ive got the cheapest tickets of the lot which means that ill be right at the back im having coffee all night and rehearsing the songs by seeing the dvds of these songs i cant wait for sunday
6522344 i liked bhoothnath a lot its my favourite film i want to see little kids dance too along with amitabh uncle
6522345 every other asian coming into my shop enquires about the tickets for the unforgettable tour and i have to sadly tell them that they are not sold here such is the demand for the show
6522346 i am going to see my favourite abhishek bachchan sing his rap song right here right now from his film bluffmaster he is so cute yet handsome i like his style of dancing
6522347 i am not going for any individual but for all of them its nice to see how the organisers wizcraft have managed to put on such a big show
6522348 roping in shilpa shetty the bachchan trio and other a listers from bollywood wasnt going to be that simple i think we all should raise a toast to bollywood for giving us endless entertainment for almost a century now
6522349 ive been a fan of minissha lamba from the moment she walked into the frame of the much under rated
6522350 im not going to tell you whether ive asked mr bachchan to shave off his beard or not but for sure this is going to be his most startling makeover in recent times
6522351 pa will be a far more emotional story than cheeni kum which was far more caustic dry and sharp tongued actually cheeni kum was inspired by one scene in raj khoslas dostana where mr bachchan had confronted zeenat aman the look of utter disdain and sarcasm in his eyes remained with me thats how his character in cheeni kum was born
6522352 ive been a fan of minissha lamba from the moment she walked into the frame of the much under rated

6522383 while costly risky and foreign to brands the biggest missed opportunity for brands in social networks is to become part of the community interact and build real relationships

6522437 theres a number of things people didnt really think abut 10 years ago like having to come up with a sustainable environment you have to focus on all of the elements and provide the best solution
6522438 and thats the future of your company if youre not bringing in new faces with fresh ideas and the right skill sets as well like being a team player youre going to fall behind in the competitive marketplace
6522439 its almost like having a starbucks in your workplace to free up peoples thoughts
6522440 youre having more collaboration more open rooms even at senior levels often people dont have an office its a real collaborative feel
6522441 and theres more meeting rooms so if youre talking with somebody you can have an impromptu meeting it kind of lends itself to more effective decision making
6522442 if people need to do sitdown work there are library areas on the floor theres no phone youre not allowed to talk there
6522443 today whether intentionally or not people are a lot more collaborative in how they do work
6522444 the workplace of the 70s and 80s cubicles is not the best work environment for everybody if youre a company that requires a fair amount of collaboration
6522445 youve got to make sure your people will be productive in the way they work it does mean there needs to be a combination of workplace settings team areas quiet time areas its important for every company to understand how does this company work
6522446 coming up with locations in the marketplace that will attract workers
6522447 its understanding what you as an organization can do to support the building what do you do within the building the quality of the carpet recycling programs and energy
6522448 youre finding more and more young people are much more conscious of green issues than the older ones in a lot of cases its a differentiation you have a higher chance of hiring somebody if theres sustainability maybe he or she will come to work for you even if the money is a little less
6522449 not only are people becoming more aware of it on a personal level corporations are beginning to realize its something they really want to be doing and not only because its the right thing
6522450 a lot of corporations are realizing its very important now it affects your way of life and your bottom line
6522451 i would say with most new buildings being built leed is definitely being considered
6522452 im proud to say im somebody who provides real estate solutions its a very sustainable way of doing things and theres no reason people shouldnt do it two or three years ago there was an increase in costs associated with it but i dont think that it will cost any more money now
6522453 im just looking forward to getting a chance to play at any
6522454 we are going to start getting ready for boston college right now
6522455 although the bovespa is resource heavy it does have other areas such as manufacturing and machinery the components are much broader than simply energy and basic resources
6522456 if theres a second half recovery itll be the second half of 2009
6522457 the recent decline in gas prices isnt enough to overcome all the negative momentum thats been building up
6522458 isolated just one milligram a very tiny amount from natural sources that were very difficult to grow
6522459 we needed to develop a concise and efficient synthetic route to make enough largazole for animal studies
6522460 my labs next task was finding the origin of lagarzoles biological activity
6522461 we studied the properties of disease causing viruses that evolved to infect mucosal surfaces to engineer a coating that enables our drug delivery particles to penetrate mucus layers in minutes in our new work we have improved the coatings considerably to allow faster penetration for a wider array of particle sizes
6522462 for example we constantly inhale particles into our lungs but they typically stick to mucus rather than penetrate it particles that stick are removed rapidly from the lungs on a mucus conveyor belt and are swallowed and sterilized in the gut mucus barriers protect us from constant infection as well as everyday things like the millions of particles in the black cloud emitted from a bus when it takes off from a stop
6522463 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
6522464 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
6522465 whats awesome is that in america we all have the same opportunity
6522466 xbox is a natural partner to help us reach out to youth voters
6522467 to realize our goal of registering 2 million young americans by this fall we need to go where young americans are and theres no doubt in our minds that many are on xbox 360 and xbox live

6522493 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
6522494 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6522495 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
6522496 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to george bush
6522497 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6522498 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6522499 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6522500 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base
6522501 at the start of the election cycle the republican party was pretty dispirited after the 2006 election and in many cases that remains true today
6522502 really early in his presidential campaign when i got the opportunity to listen intently to his ideas and his platforms i immediately said this is beyond belief
6522503 i joined the effort and it became clear to me that i was better able to work in my community in a broad way and support this outstanding candidate as a democrat
6522504 if its going to be a close election it could be a huge factor
6522505 youre going to see some turnout like youve never seen before in the state of florida
6522506 my goal here is that african americans who have voted democratic their entire lives will begin to at least consider a republican candidate
6522507 and then ill move to the second goal of registration but it is a slow process
6522508 its a funny thing about obama but when i see him speak and see him on the stage i dont see him as a black man i just see a man he symbolizes hope and we surely need hope
6522509 during their extreme growth mode which was too ambitious they took on some leases at the wrong price and wrong location

6522516 isso depende muito de cada jogador do temperamento comportamento at da sua qualidade mas principalmente da forma com que ele chega l o seu pr prio temperamento o pablo um jogador que sempre foi muito aguerrido valente um jogador que eu trouxe do olaria para o vasco sabe o que a dificuldade passou por muita no olaria dormindo em baixo de arquibancada ele vai para os treinamentos como quem vai para a guerra com disposi o se voc mandar ele fazer dez cruzamentos ele faz vinte talvez ao edu e carlinhos tenha faltado um pouco dessa determina o de agarrar essa oportunidade mas s o dois garotos muito novos isso para eles foi um aprendizado e continuam na equipe profissional acredito que dentro em breve eles j mais amadurecidos porque h jogadores a gente pode citar muitos que s estouraram com 22 23 24 anos preciso ter muita calma nessa hora para n o se queimar o jogador s vezes ele chega na primeira vez sente o baque n o vai bem mas n o por isso deixa de ser um bom jogador preciso ter muita paci ncia

6522544 i was thinking about it three years ago about what happens when its time for the next phase of life for some of these girls who have lived in the playboy mansion and how do you sort of reenter the real world and i pitched the character to two female writers and together they wrote a script and together we produced it and the next thing you know were shooting at the playboy mansion
6522545 when we went and pitched it i would be in character and so i was starting to really have a clear vision of who shelley was having said that it was really intimidating
6522546 shelley yknow shes got a lot of hair she likes a lot of makeup we had to do a lot of body make up and make up to make my cleavage look bigger getting into the wardrobe usually took a good 20 minutes or so strapping in it was like yeah it was a challenge the shoes i loved as i think everyone knows i kept them all i still will put them on at night and trot around i dont go anywhere but i loved wearing those
6522547 just keep your eye out for maybe the september issue laughs i have to cryptic about these things im instructed to be
6522548 i was a dork i was a computer nerd i grew up and went through the same thing we both had braces and glasses and this curly fro and i wasnt necessarily too active in getting in the social crowd so i definitely understand the entirely not fitting in but i think everyone has their own version of feeling a bit out of place and one of the great things i think that we have the ability to do is show that its alright you can have that awkward phase its not about whether youre the popular girl or the nerdy one its just about feeling confident and comfortable with kind of where you fit and who you are and accessing that and making that your own
6522549 i have a lot of respect for those girls in high school who have to wear them
6522550 i think one of the things im most excited about with this movie especially just growing up in hollywood and having two younger sisters there is so much pressure i think from everywhere to look a certain way and dress a certain way
6522551 everybody has an opinion and we live in america so youre allowed to the thing about it is the media is an interesting outlet because it allows people to see who they think you are an idea of you but it might not be who you really are as long as you are comfortable with who you know you really and true to be and your friends and the people around you you know that and who you really are thats all that really matters
6522552 im not gonna say i was a dork in high school i struggled with weight in high school i had times where i didnt really want to hang out with the cool kids it was kind of like being a librarian and keeping to myself so i think everybody has a moment in their life where they feel not so comfortable in their skin or connected to what we call the popular group or whatever i was involved in a theater group theater parts in high school so that sort of kept me really busy and then swim team i had friends and stuff but i was friends with a lot of different people in high school so i guess that was my outlet
6522553 i had two different bellies one that was prosthetic and one that was like a pregnant pad which i showed very graphically how it connects at the bottom
6522554 my first instinct was to honestly not like that would be random if she just suddenly sings well that just would not make any sense like oh theres singing a good song i did a good job i guess i sounded bad
6522555 when i was young i never really thought to judge it really to uh feel like an outsider i sort of just always did my thing and it made me happy i made a lot of websites laughs but i thought it was fun this really came in perfect time for me because i was 18 when we were shooting this and that period really for me this has been the strangest period of trying to figure out who i am to accept that what you like is what you like and who you are is who you are and everyday i try to remind myself of that
6522556 it felt important that we all got along really well because this sorority can only really speak to each other there are seven girls that are so completely socially inept that they cant strike up a conversation with anyone of course what anna brought to the role is somebody they could relate to from the outside it is so true it was so important that someone like anna or just anna play this role because her likeability her heart shines through the whole thing and it really only makes sense in the situation if it was anyone else playing it with less love than it just wouldnt relate

6522560 its funny all their friends know that im a crossing guard
6522561 a lot of people have been doing this for 20 or 30 years
6522562 they are truly dedicated you dont stand out in michigan winters for nothing
6522563 it helps out the school its important to have crossing guards we need them out there
6522564 instead of dozens of flights each day between new york and san francisco carrying 200 people apiece there might be only a handful carrying 800 or more in new extra jumbo jets
6522565 flying was a special event you could hardly find a ticket from new york to europe for less than 5 000 probably 50k in todays dollars men put on suits women wore hats and heels and some of the luxury planes like pan ams clipper had bridal suites dining salons and beds
6522566 to start with flight may become once again largely confined to a more elite jet setting class
6522567 it will involve a shift in peoples decisions of whether they have to move
6522568 if people are separated for longer dont see each other as often its going to hurt

6522598 but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market
6522599 her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it

6522626 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands squad for the natwest series after careful consideration
6522627 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6522628 i decided to retire from englands odi team for a number reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family
6522629 now that my family is settled and my bowling is settled i feel i have something to offer englands odi side and am looking forward to playing a part in the natwest series against south africa
6522630 having missed out on selection at various times this year i am well aware of the disappointment that comes from not being a part of the england dressing room
6522631 with that in mind i want to be a part of the team and if that means bringing myself out of retirement to play a role in this upcoming natwest series then im happy to do just that
6522632 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6522633 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6522634 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6522635 when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember its seven

6522666 i think that our gadget conscious public has shown an unawareness of the special advantages and special disadvantages of electronic machinery as compared with the human brain
6522667 the number of switching devices in the human brain vastly exceeds the number in any computing machine yet developed or even thought of for design in the near future
6522668 the reality of the phenomena must be regarded as proved as certainly as anything in scientific research can be proved
6522669 that there is a capacity for acquiring knowledge that transcends the sensory functions this extra sensory capacity can give us knowledge certainly of objective and very likely of subjective states knowledge of matter and most probably of minds
6522670 once a scientist attacks a problem which he knows to have an answer his entire attitude is changed he is already some fifty per cent of his way toward that answer
6522671 he had been striving to decipher the somewhat obscure impression of a fossil fish on the stone slab in which it was preserved
6522672 he went early to the jardin des plantes thinking that on looking anew at the impression he would see something to put him on the track of his vision
6522673 towards morning the fish reappeared in his dream confusedly at first but at last with such distinctness that he no longer had any doubt as to its zoological characters
6522674 in the morning he was surprised to see in his nocturnal sketch features which he thought it impossible the fossil itself would reveal he hastened to the jardin des plantes and with his drawing as a guide succeeded in chiseling away the surface of the stone under which portions of the fish proved to be hidden when wholly exposed the fossil corresponded with his dream and his drawing and he succeeded in classifying it with ease

6522685 the nepali people are rising their level of arousal is amazing they are more ahead in consciousness than the leadership of the political parties the feudal class will try to resist change but the ca composition and the level of awareness of the people is very high they cannot withstand this pressure
6522686 to show they are serious about the social transformations in whose name they went to war they have a very strong presence in the villages and many now long for them to be able to build on the starts they have made at eroding caste and gender discrimination they also promise a more equitable system of land ownership

6522689 when groups on the terrorist list start winning elections another curious thing takes place the very term terrorist becomes inverted its utter falsity is seen through and a kind of moral collapse of the us and what it represents take place there is a kind of moral reversal

6522694 we have seen how a coup was engineered to stop hamas becoming the government of palestine there is every reason to believe that the us is trying to plan something similar in nepal here the cpn maoist has planned accordingly and prepared for any necessity
6522695 for the masses of people in nepal the poor and the oppressed the destitute and the landless history is only just beginning

6522702 yes waldo has infiltrated our film and he can be seen in almost every crowd shot taking place at hogwarts
6522703 the problem is not these few scenes in fact the problem is every other scene waldo has such an uncanny ability to hide that we have had to go back through the film frame by frame and look for him that is something like 684 000 frames ilm has had to go through just looking for the blasted man
6522704 so often i have to lie and make up half truths about what really is going on with any one of our films we felt releasing this behind the scenes image without actually telling anyone he was there would allow fans to realize just how hard it actually is to find waldo we just couldnt make the planned november release and had to delay
6522705 everything has been agreed with abdoulaye in fact it was all agreed at the back end of last week
6522706 unfortunately the work permit situation isnt as straightforward because he hasnt played the requisite number of games for the application to go straight through
6522707 however having gone through it with abdoulaye the reason he hasnt played the games is because he has been injured
6522708 we have been in constant contact with the home office and we have got an agreement with them that providing we can prove he wasnt selected because he was injured then they will approve that work permit application
6522709 what we require from that to put it simply is a certification from the international team doctor that he was not fit or available for selection in those games
6522710 the decision about my future lies with az but a chance to play in england or spain would be sensational for me
6522711 another way to say this is that whenever there is
6522712 respondo por mi bancada y sta es una bancada que ha actuado de manera un nime porque estamos conscientes de que cometimos un error y es de nobleza reconocerlo
6522713 hoy hemos tomado la decisi n de renunciar a este incremento pensando en que el momento y la oportunidad en que se tom esta decisi n no era el adecuado y en esa perspectiva en forma un nime se resolvi no hacer uso de este beneficio y reintegrar los montos recibidos el mes pasado
6522714 lo sucedido se puede calificar como un error de apreciaci n desde el punto de vista del momento pues este sistema est instituido por la c mara hace mucho tiempo y la idea es mantener el equivalente a la cantidad de litros y en ese sentido se hizo tal cual se hac a siempre pero el momento en que se hizo no era el apropiado y como depende de nosotros mismos corregir los errores lo hemos corregido reintegrando el incremento recibido y renunciando a la asignaci n hacia delante

6522720 im the luckiest guy on gods green earth i swear
6522721 he is quick to take on any task with a smile
6522722 ray was patient enough to get in there and organize it
6522723 he doesnt have to be told he looks for things to do
6522724 its nice to have someone who wants to take care of you
6522725 its a trap for elderly people when you get to feel as if youre useless as if youve done your thing and now youre cast aside im not about to be cast aside
6522726 hey now all you children leave your lights on you better leave your lights on cause theres a monster livin under my bed whisperin in my ear and theres an angel with her hand on my head she say i got nothing to fear theres darkness livin deep in my soul so let your light shine
6522727 i know the citizens of orangeburg county will be glad to see that we now have a pool in our backyard
6522728 it is high time we stop reading about some of our young folks and all people drowning because they cant swim
6522729 i think i will go out and dance when they start doing the work
6522730 we are pleased to be recognized by inc for the second consecutive year
6522731 it is proof that our model continues to resonate in the marketplace in a tight economy companies are even more focused on customer acquisition and as a result we see many opportunities to expand into new verticals
6522732 red ventures has proven to be a valuable strategic partner for directv
6522733 in the highly competitive paid television category a focus on profitable growth is critical red ventures shares that focus and has helped us further our leadership position by generating good quality new subscribers in large volumes
6522734 our platform is infinitely scalable to new products services and markets and our team is energized by the myriad avenues for future growth
6522735 seniors are part of a generation that had to do without and overcome adversity so they may be less inclined to complain
6522736 this happened purely because a need just happened to come up that looked like it would serve both groups
6522737 cleaning and indeed cleansing is such a central theme of the high holy days especially yom kippur thats when it occurred to me that no one i know has their kippah cleaned so we thought we would offer the service free this year
6522738 your scalp and hair expels stuff using a kippah as a filter the more religious you are the more you wear it so the more dirt it picks up
6522739 we expect the surge to start when people return from their summer holidays in israel and marbella and the community is reminded that the holidays are approaching
6522740 with these high holy day clothes that i do clean i pledge this one goal as cleanliness is second to godliness i will also look to cleanse my soul
6522741 kippot rarely if ever need dry cleaning its more the mind underneath that could use the occasional stain removal
6522742 there is never a dirty yarmulka on the rubinstein head
6522743 i have about eight yarmulkas which i rotate on a weekly basis they can get dirty and sweaty i wash mine in the sink i have even taken it into the shower with me by accident one more than one occasion
6522744 personally its the only way to get ahead i think its a lovely idea for those people who have exquisite and antique headwear for those in need of special care
6522745 a kippah is difficult to clean and it might be more economical to buy a new one but a free dry cleaning service sounds good to me if i give them four will they do my kapote frock coat too
6522746 we wanted to build something that we could use ourselves
6522747 a lot of people walk around with pocket sized siddurs so if you travel this is the perfect aid
6522748 sandlers open cultural narcissism identifying a list of people who are jewish just like you and me on national tv without fear that this might be a problem dispensed with the underlying subject of american jewish comedy say it loud no more anxious self deprecation just the slightest bit of irony
6522749 basically a less anguished version of the character played by eric bana
6522750 i love my country but the fighting it never ends
6522751 the jewish communities of asia have historically been very low profile with little communication across the jews living working and visiting asia
6522752 the plan of the paper and website is to provide a platform for communities to tell each other whats going on
6522753 one of the reasons i decided to launch the paper was because there are an increasing number of jews moving to asia for business opportunities hong kong is still the regional hub but in the future i think china beijing and shanghai will become very popular too its a community that is definitely growing
6522754 ser ambicioso e ir a por el partido con el objetivo de consolidar la imagen ofrecida en el encuentro de ida y evitar que esa imagen se convierta en un espejismo
6522755 debemos ir con la mentalidad de que tenemos opciones reales de ganar la supercopa
6522756 cualquiera de los de arriba tiene calidad suficiente para ganar la final
6522757 hay que dar pasos peque os y seguros porque no hay que olvidar que venimos del abismo ahora tenemos la posibilidad de ganar un t tulo y comenzar la liga cargados de confianza
6522758 ha de saber cuando vender a sus jugadores y es mejor hacer el esfuerzo para que ellos se queden convencidos comprometidos y con ilusi n que salir fuera a comprar jugadores de sus caracter sticas
6522759 se le da m s importancia de la que tiene
6522760 lo m s importante no es quien lleva el brazalete sino quien da la cara por el equipo en los momentos complicados lo importante es que la persona que lleve el brazalete est respaldado por el vestuario
6522761 what were seeing is a bit of a belated catch up in canada to the surge in global food prices we saw earlier this year
6522762 because even with the pullback in grain prices theyre still well up from a year ago
6522763 some of that strength in grain prices earlier this year was for real
6522764 partly its just a matter of food companies making sure that its not just a fluke thats going to be quickly reversed
6522765 grain prices make up only a small share about two per cent of the actual final food price
6522766 unfortunately canadians are going to be experiencing continued pressure on food prices in the future
6522767 earlier this year we were faced by just some astronomical unprecedented commodity price increases
6522768 weve seen some relief in the area of wheat pricing its only double what it was last year versus being triple or quadruple the price
6522769 we are big users of both electricity and natural gas as well as producing a fresh product our industry has trucks on the road everyday delivering
6522770 when you look at energy in total theres been significant pressure on all forms of energy but the most acute of late has been transportation costs
6522771 packaging if its plastic its petroleum based so theres been pressures there
6522772 were starting to see the results of all those inflationary price pressures materialize at the retail level
6522773 mind you we still have an incredibly incredibly competitive retail environment
6522774 so just how much of that pressure will materialize at the retail level thats something for the market to decide
6522775 its possible that some of the grain prices we saw earlier this year were in bubble territory
6522776 is that even with a short pullback theyre still in some cases double where they were a year ago
6522777 were faced with on the agriculture side increasing demand worldwide and significant challenges with supply so prices go up
6522778 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6522779 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
6522780 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited
6522781 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s
6522782 this report is a one stop shop document that can guide us toward ensuring that we get clean safe water to canadians wherever they choose to live
6522783 the fact that theyre even taking this close a look at this issue is good news in my mind because theyve been away from the fresh water scene for so long

6522812 im really pleased to join a good club with good players sunderland is a club i think is going to achieve things they have big ambitions thats why i chose to come here i liked what the club had to say to me
6522813 if there is a large ape that starts climbing the empire state building it might get in his way
6522814 we are ready and dmitri medvedev has confirmed this to review a syrian request to purchase new types of weapons
6522815 we will supply syria primarily with weapons of a defensive nature that will not disturb the strategic balance in the region
6522816 we understand russias stance and are sympathetic to the military operation
6522817 we consider it a reaction to a provocation by the georgian side
6522818 we want to express our support for the russian position on the matter of this conflict and the situation as a whole around abkhazia and south ossetia

6522824 i wanted to let you know ive been doing well
6522825 i love to write songs because its a way to express yourself its cool
6522826 but i dont know if any of my songs will be on the album that would be cool if any of them did make it but its a matter of finding the best songs i definitely want to just write more and see if there are any songs that are suitable for it
6522827 im just going to go the pop route and find a nice balance between young stuff and those songs i can be expressive with and connect with well
6522828 the shoots been going great and its been a lot of fun as well
6522829 i cant wait for you guys to see it too
6522830 were still finishing things up here but so far its been so much fun
6522831 we live in fear our minds houses and cities became our prisons evil done to others turns against us
6522832 there can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator
6522833 i feel i must tell the prefect cardinal arinze that the devastating impression the congregation for divine worship seems to be spreading throughout the church that men of great culture in their own lands are not capable of translating liturgical texts into their own mother tongue is causing great discontent and concern in the church
6522834 so let me add my wish list to your own ideas regarding what remains to be done or redone
6522835 but theyre new so these ladies are a little rough around the edges and theyre still a little boyish thats the attraction though theyre all new to the scene but theyre all training and aspiring to be the ultimate transsexual isnt the quest for the best always an admirable goal
6522836 like diamonds in the rough these trannies need training and ed hunter is uniquely qualified to bring it out of these boys
6522837 he actually came up to the car that i was in and was complaining and was saying how disgusting it was
6522838 then he goes and reaches to grab one of the girls and when she pushes him away he punches her in the face
6522839 but she isnt hurt and she took it all in stride
6522840 the black reign series has been mercenary pictures most prominent and continues to grab the attention of the public and reviewers
6522841 this volume is a standout because of the outstanding talent we have lined up our cover girls cassidy clay and diamond jackson are amazing beauties who know how to play to the camera and give a great scene
6522842 black reign 14 and all of mercenary pictures ethnic productions is high production values as well as the high standards steele sets for the performers he added
6522843 ive always made my ethnic movies the centerpieces of mercenary pictures
6522844 other producers give ethnic titles an afterthought or they just dont think theyre worth as much as their non ethnic productions black reign as well as our new black girl line black moon risin
6522845 control 9 and her featured role in tickle me pinks new music video for their song
6522846 its so cool because ill go out with some friends and somebody will tell me that they recognize me i have to ask how because buying one of my digital playground films is a bit different from seeing me on mtv
6522847 all of our girls have an amazing ability to crossover between the adult world and the mainstream world very few adult performers can do that i really believe the lines are blurring between the two industries look at the success of the r rated version of pirates gabriella just made that jump and the fact that she is an adult star is only helping her it gives her an edge
6522848 i didnt get into adult film to jump into mainstream work i love to have sex and make pornos and i love the idea of people watching me when im getting pounded it would be great if i could continue to do mainstream things but i have no intention to stop making films like sexy hot my scenes with erik everhard and johnny sins were amazing i have never been fucked like that so why would i ever want to stop
6522849 ill be taking cold showers every time i see her
6522850 the show provided five scenes full of tease and heated sexual action and was another step in the evolution of contract cutie gabriella fox gabriella fox sexy hot showed the lead as being sexy and hot her wow factor still on the rise at this writing the technical values were solid and the bts had some of the self deprecating humor the crew is known for
6522851 we wanted the biggest name in adult entertainment so we obviously went out and got jesse jane
6522852 this is jesses first time at our club but we expect good stuff from her she puts on an energetic show and we are really excited to have her so is everyone else cause the phones have been ringing off the hook
6522853 every time jesse is out there she gives it her all
6522854 when youre the best in the world there is never any time to let up jesse continues to excel in her performances on stage and in front of the camera i admire her drive and focus and know that the fans do too
6522855 yeah for rhode island i was there around six months ago and am glad to be coming back people are so nice up there and i can always count on my fans to come out and support me people just need to get their butts in the seat and i will take care of the rest itll be the best show of their lives i want to get everyone so turned on that they cant stand it satisfied smiles are my reward
6522856 i extend much gratitude to avi britton and bonnie klair at wicked pictures for believing in us from the start we got a great email from avi saying that she is very please by how her company brand is treated by our site and that means weve reached the goal we set out to achieve we want all the companies that work with us to know that we will make them look good as well as get them sales

6522872 you cant rule out the possibility of a cancellation considering the absolute lack of a consensus at this stage
6522873 if countries like australia pull out there is no question of the tournament going ahead with substitutes like bangladesh
6522874 obviously ess wants the best teams to participate and ensure a world class tournament
6522875 it is possible to ensure quality coverage if it is shifted to a nearby country even now but it will involve significant extra costs for the broadcaster
6522876 we are still fighting and are hopeful of hosting the tournament
6522877 the issue of security is subjective and what some may believe to be reality will be seen as mere perception by others
6522878 this is the issue that has to be resolved on sunday if the tournament has to go ahead

6522885 what is now seen as a predominantly younger pastime will spread to encompass a wider group of people in part due to the aging of current online video viewers but also as a result of word of mouth spread of services growth of in home networks and new network connected consumer electronic devices
6522886 the survey data in a recent in stat report indicates that over half of consumers actually still prefer packaged goods which bodes well for blu ray discs surprisingly younger people who regularly watch online were the group that expressed the highest interest in owning a package goods bundle that includes artwork and extra content

6522892 i felt it a few strides before that he wasnt strong
6522893 i didnt think it was an option so thanks to him
6522894 i just got in my playbook and made sure i was sound with everyone else
6522895 my technique wasnt there yet and i struggled with a lot of things but there were a lot of positive things and i learned fast from it
6522896 its a big team but one thing that i know that we can take care of is how our offensive line works
6522897 were with the guys at practice all of the time so we can focus on making sure they finish each play finishing through the drill paying attention to detail and just really doing what they can to help us get better we know what everybody in that room can do weve been around each other enough so if somebody is tired or gassed then we can see and tell them to pick it up
6522898 the more leaders youve got in a group the better everybody can lead someone else its just like a chain youre pulling everybody along if im doing something wrong then weve given them permission to say hey thats not right and the same goes off the field and in the classroom
6522899 as you get older you know the technique almost as good as the coaches because the coaches have taught you everything they know
6522900 and if you really listen and youre a student of the game you can turn around and coach these guys while the coach is over there coaching other guys it helps out your depth a lot
6522901 gaskins has got some of the quickest most natural moves
6522902 hes just so explosive and hes such a quick player that he can be outstanding thats one guy that really focusing on his technique right now and hes come a long way hes just got to be confident in becoming consistent but hes got so much potential that hes going to be a great player
6522903 if this doesnt make people forgive me and stop talking about all that i dont know what will
6522904 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6522905 in terms of whos an elitist i think people have made a judgment that john mccain is not an arugula eating pointy headed professor type based on his life story
6522906 well ive actually been approved by the government to play a show
6522907 ive already sold 10 000 tickets there so i will be going to put on a concert for the fans
6522908 they tend to you know sometimes not want western artists in their country
6522909 i respect that but at the same time you know theres people that listen to music there and want to see their idols and stuff so its all good been approved by the government and im going to go put on a show and have fun
6522910 there are very few things that you can say to parents in such a horrible time certainly everyone works to keep schools safe as most districts we have cameras in schools resource officers and security officers our schools have emergency plans and the principals have worked with chief odonald sheriff blanton and chief hamm on these plans our law enforcement officers have done walk thrus and practice exercises in many of our schools we are fortunate to have 3 people in charge of law enforcement that put such a priority on school safety our principals and asst principals carry nextel phones with the push to talk feature they also have student info loaded onto a pda we have the ability to do mass calling through a system called alert now parents should tell students to talk to teachers principals or someone in the school if they see or hear anything that seems unsafe i hate to think about it but if anything ever happens they should listen the schools have plans and the plans are coordinated with police officers hopefully we will never use them
6522911 we begin by educating our employees and students about safety and security we have drills to practice what to do in case of an intruder we encourage students to tell adults if they hear or see anything that causes concerns or fears we have guidance counselors for students we have mental health counselors for students we have security cameras on buses in buildings and outside buildings all buildings are secured and locked all visitors have to enter the main office of a school we have school resource officers assigned to all of our schools we have emergency management plans for all schools that are reviewed annually and updated we do everything we can to keep children and employees safe we have mentoring programs in all of our schools for students at risk we have advisor advisee programs in our secondary schools for all students this allows students to make personal connections with adults in the building which helps with communication
6522912 we had a few folks attend the nims national incident management system training last week and thus will update our crisis management document we are also planning to schedule the training for all principals sometime in the very near future and would like to conduct a drill during this school year in coordination with the sheriffs dept and other agencies we continue to look for ways to ensure a safe place for students to learn

6522914 its very unlikely that we would bring the i10 to the united states were looking at it but right now its unlikely
6522915 part of what the chambers been doing for the past year is to focus on the grassroots side of this rather than on the paid media side

6522920 were proud to continue the tradition of political queer and feminist punk
6522921 the new album brings a new sense of versatility in todays market in the metal genre
6522922 nothing like whats out today we set out to create and write a new explosive sound where the fans and new fans can distinguish and separate autumn black from the rest of the pack
6522923 uniting metal fans and hardcore fans with the pop culture is what we are aiming for
6522924 we are very excited of the release of the unborn tragedy
6522925 a hopeful cry not to forget the mistakes of yesterday in our actions of today
6522926 we felt amongst each other that we wanted to bring something fresh to the table while still being heavy and clever at the same time
6522927 we didnt want to be one of those bands which i will not mention that sound identical i e chug chug the unborn tragedy shows very well the capabilities of the bands musicianship and the maturity of the songwriting within the group very well thought out very heavy very melodic and above all very different
6522928 almost 25 percent of what we pay today goes to someone other than the oil companies and we could lower those taxes and that would be short term relief
6522929 this is a candidate and campaign management training day to give people the basic idea of what they would need to do to run
6522930 we want to build the confidence to go out there and get involved
6522931 but unlike our opponent who has raised most of his money in washington and new york city were going to represent the people of central new york
6522932 voters dont care about that what dan maffei cares about and what voters care about is bringing good paying jobs back to central new york
6522933 unfortunately the opposition seems to be turning this race into who has the most money
6522934 but its about the candidate its about the candidate whos going to do the most for upstate new york
6522935 it is time that voters in the 25th district have the opportunity to hear from both candidates on the substantive issues facing our region
6522936 voters are tired of just hearing about politics they want to know what we have to say about the issues i have already been discussing the economy the war and the environment and telling voters where i stand on a variety of issues given the vast differences between me and my opponent voters need to see us share a stage and explain our positions
6522937 i think its important to let the voters ask us questions we should make these events town hall style to encourage maximum participation
6522938 voters of the 25th congressional district are about to elect a new representative to congress and those voters need to know if who they elect will continue down the same path or as i have proposed head in a new direction with new ideas
6522939 the text of the letter which was hand delivered to sweetland is below
6522940 public service professions are vital to creating the kinds of vibrant communities where people want to stay and raise their families
6522941 we have so much talent and experience right here in upstate new york thats why its important that we foster an atmosphere that encourages people to enter vital service professions like teaching nursing and other careers
6522942 americans and western new yorkers specifically have always proven themselves to be generous and hard working
6522943 starting today we need to tap into the energy and creativity of our citizens to tackle our nations most trying problems by attracting our best and brightest into professions like teaching nursing and social work we can ensure secure long term jobs here in western new york helping to reverse our brain drain
6522944 we have a real plan to help create needed jobs in western new york
6522945 todays discussion was about how we as the future leaders of this region will work together to get results for working families every american has the right to a quality and affordable college education and a good job with solid benefits and we have a great plan to do just that
6522946 we want to encourage them to stay here and one of the ways you do that and frankly it works better for them as well is to make sure that theres loan forgiveness if theyre willing to make a contribution to their own community
6522947 increasing big oils already record setting profits wont help consumers at the pump and drilling in anwr wont produce a single barrel of oil for a decade we have to do more now to diversify where we get our energy like investing in natural gas solar and wind and finally break our addiction to oil
6522948 unfortunately congress is gridlocked and will now recess for five weeks without passing anything to help real people deal with the suffocating gas prices when i get to congress i will move beyond partisanship and produce some real results for americans
6522949 maffeis fundraising advantage and exposure has led cq politics to change its rating on the race to leans democrat from no clear favorite
6522950 voters are clearly responding to my message of change and a new direction for upstate new york
6522951 they are tired of the policies of the past that have hurt hard working men and women and caused this area to lose thousands of jobs we can do better we must do better in order to make our region a place where people can stay and raise their families
6522952 ill tell you what even though im sometimes down on my country because of the pathetic state of our government
6522953 their easy fatty acid removal efar system recycles any unreacted raw material back through the reactor
6522954 zes dagen in de week zult ge werken de zevende dag zult ge de kleine karweitjes doen
6522955 the question of independence goes to the heart of meaningful assurance which is why we identify it as a key element
6522956 one of the key messages of assure view is that companies which write the reports cannot at the same time be regarded as offering truly independent assurance by taking on both tasks such an organization cannot be considered to be independent
6522957 the gri guidelines are a reporting standard tool not an assurance standard tool
6522958 we address the gri guidelines at several points in the report where we point out that some assurors give the impression that they are using the guidelines as a protocol this is unhelpful and is creating confusion as if we didnt already have enough confusion in this field
6522959 key goals must be to encourage greater uptake of assurance in csr reports and to make this assurance meaningful by which we mean following our identified key elements of assurance best practice at the moment the three major assurance provider types are all coming from different directions and their paths need to converge
6522960 we dont know why specifically north american reporters are so reluctant to use assurance in their csr reports but the statistics show clearly that this is the case
6522961 us companies are reporting but they are not covering the depth and breadth of issues seen in european reports the development of assurance provision is contingent upon a foundation of quality disclosure
6522962 and then come to the bridge the biggest thing that folks can do is come on that walk
6522963 if youve never done it before now is a good time to come on the walk and do it
6522964 this bad idea would do nothing to lower gas prices anytime in the foreseeable future and is a clear example of why our current energy policy has failed us so completely its time to break our dependence on foreign oil and on fossil fuels in general by investing in alternative and renewable fuels that hold so much promise and would help drive the future of our local economy
6522965 i think walsh made the right decision we need to use all the tools that we can a comprehensive plan needs to be put together we know there is oil there i believe we can drill responsibly we can be environmentally safe we can lay out a plan to sensibly go about drilling in anwr and then add to that the alternative energy industry and other technologies to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
6522966 it is an affront to the bill of rights in particular the 10th amendment to prohibit alaska from tapping into its own natural resources beyond the adverse effect to the alaskan economy this violation of the constitution has driven gasoline prices to unbearable levels causing economic strife to every american i think it is appalling that we allow cuba and china to drill in the florida straits meanwhile forbidding our own selves from seeking the common good in this case a way to lower the price of gasoline
6522967 last week my opponent announced his support for big oil and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge
6522968 companies like exxon mobil are not interested in lowering gas prices as their actions clearly demonstrated yesterday its time to make a choice are you for big oil or are you on the side of consumers i choose the consumer
6522969 the rockefeller family recognizes the need to move in a different direction why cant my opponent
6522970 drilling in anwr would be great for companies like exxon mobil but would do nothing for you and me its time to give people real solutions including developing alternative and renewable fuels we as a region are uniquely positioned to capitalize on investments in these technologies
6522971 the most important thing about memorial day is that we do honor our fallen but also our living veterans one of the best ways we can do that is pass a full gi bill that would do that same kind of thing for our new veterans as we did for our world war ii and korea veterans
6522972 for too long the federal government has short changed our schools districts forcing local property taxes to skyrocket
6522973 its time congress stepped up and did the right thing to make our schools safe modern and efficient so our kids can get the education they need to succeed
6522974 the only energy policy they have is to drill for more oil we need a whole new approach to energy in this country and the green schools initiative is a good start it will help our schools it will help us use energy more efficiently and it will save us money its a new way of dealing with an old problem and thats why i support it
6522975 we are in the perfect position to be the leaders in getting ourselves off of the addiction of oil
6522976 is he says do what the oil companies want and somehow thatll help consumers i dont believe we can do that any longer we cant be both with big oil and with consumers
6522977 windfall profits of oil companies yeah and oil companies are making a lot of money on the other hand i dont think any of these folks behind me will disagree that if oil companies are taxed more heavily theyll just say ok
6522978 the way to continue our fight now to accomplish the goals for which we stand is to take our energy and our passion our strength and do all we can to help elect barack obama the next president of the united states
6522979 i think we will see all of new york follow because the republicans under george w bush and it would continue with john mccain its been horrendous for new york particularly for upstate new york
6522980 if they believed in hillary clinton as a candidate then once theyre over feeling hurt that senator clinton didnt make it to become the nominee i think she can rally them in support of senator obama
6522981 senator obama has to show that hes very pro small business that hes very pro economic development that were going to see a lot of public private partnerships and cooperation with business and government
6522982 on the other hand if oil companies are taxed more heavily they wont just say well suck that up and we wont pass that on to all of us at the gas pump
6522983 my plan takes the power away from big oil by taxing their huge windfall profits and eliminating the unconscionable subsidies they receive
6522984 it would reinvest the money into alternative and renewable fuels so we can end our dependence on foreign oil
6522985 here in onondaga county we can say from experience that these schemes simply do not work
6522986 congress should have done it years ago so that supply would be there for us today
6522987 i dont think you can have a solution to the energy crisis without standing up to the oil companies
6522988 what benefit have we gotten out of our ridiculous ethanol initiatives
6522989 all my former colleagues in the local media must be wondering where did he go wrong
6522990 it was one of the very rare times i missed a legislature session
6522991 as far as i know i was ill or out of town for my regular job
6522992 the war in iraq is a shame if i had been in congress at the time i probably wouldnt have voted to go to iraq
6522993 this is one of the single most important issues facing the country and the voters of this district deserve to know where the candidates running for congress stand in clear unequivocal terms
6522994 if somehow people think the way to force the withdrawal is to not fund supplies and equipment to the troops thats the wrong thing to do
6522995 ill look to the military leaders for advice on whether the job in iraq is done whether weve accomplished all we can accomplish how do we withdraw when do we withdraw and what gets left behind
6522996 the question is whether or not our leadership in washington in the political arena will listen to them
6522997 how can someone say they support the troops and then vote against those troops when the come home
6522998 its time for all the politicians who pay lip service to supporting our troops put their money where their mouth is we owe a debt to our nations veterans and we are currently in default that is why this legislation is needed now
6522999 were pouring billions and billions of dollars into iraq every month the least we can do is allocate a tiny fraction of that money to make sure our returning veterans have access to college
6523000 after world war ii we recognized the huge debt we owed to our veterans and provided them with a g i bill that allowed them to get a good education and good job it ensured our economic prosperity for decades and for us to do less for veterans today is shameful
6523001 this is one of the single most important issues facing the country and the voters of this district deserve to know where the candidates running for congress stand in clear unequivocal terms
6523002 i would have voted in favor of continuing to support our troops in iraq and give them what they need but i would have also voted for the other key parts of this bill to begin the withdrawal of our troops to force the iraqi government to shoulder more of the costs of this unending war and to give our returning troops the kind of educational benefits they deserve
6523003 our veterans deserve whatever help we can give them as they return to civilian life
6523004 there always seem to be some politicians who support our troops when theyre heading off to war but dont want to do anything to help them when they come home i think thats wrong
6523005 how can you say this is the most important battle of our time and then not even bother to vote yes or no on funding the troops
6523006 the republicans cant even figure out where they stand on the war anymore they need to have the courage of their convictions vote to fund the war or not fund the war but dont vote present thats a cop out
6523007 we keep pouring billions of dollars into that country and at some point we have to turn the spigot off
6523008 we need that money here at home its long past time the iraqi government stepped up and shouldered their fair share of the costs of this unending war
6523009 america is at a tipping point and central new york is at a tipping point we in this room have been talking about and fighting for change for so many years well ladies and gentlemen change is here it is happening now it is inevitable
6523010 my number one priority as a candidate and as a congressman is going to help put us back on the map by creating new jobs good jobs
6523011 we believe voters are anxious to hear what candidates have to say now and not later
6523012 i think voters need to realize theyll be electing a new congressman for the first time in 20 years
6523013 times are tough for families here in central and upstate new york costs are up and employment is down
6523014 but i know our region already has the capital it needs to bring jobs back terrific natural resources some of the top institutions of higher learning in the world and great quality of life
6523015 we need new ideas that can bring innovative jobs to our region my plan will improve our business climate to ensure businesses that stay here will remain competitive in the global market our universities are producing incredibly talented graduates it is up to us to provide those young people with attractive opportunities to stay within our community
6523016 companies like general electric general motors kodak chrysler carrier xerox and crouse hinds are gone or are shadows of their former selves
6523017 our tax code rewards companies that move jobs out of the country
6523018 our tax code treats profits earned by foreign subsidiaries of american corporations differently putting companies who want to create jobs in the united states at a competitive disadvantage
6523019 by the time i went to my 10th high school reunion most of my classmates had left
6523020 i refuse to believe every option for speeding up progress on the new centro hub has been exhausted instead of exclusively focusing all our energies on arguing about drilling for more oil we need to discuss alternative energy and alternative transportation options that will decrease our dependence on oil
6523021 the metropolitan development association today announced 225 000 in grants to support research projects by three upstate companies and their university partners the products have the potential to create 17 jobs and generate 14 3 million in new revenue for the companies the association said the money for the grants for growth is coming from a 1 million state grant secured by state sen john defrancisco r syracuse
6523022 it is time that voters in the 25th district have the opportunity to hear from both candidates on the substantive issues facing our region
6523023 voters are tired of just hearing about politics they want to know what we have to say about the issues i have already been discussing the economy the war and the environment and telling voters where i stand on a variety of issues given the vast differences between me and my opponent voters need to see us share a stage and explain our positions
6523024 i think its important to let the voters ask us questions we should make these events town hall style to encourage maximum participation
6523025 voters of the 25th congressional district are about to elect a new representative to congress and those voters need to know if who they elect will continue down the same path or as i have proposed head in a new direction with new ideas
6523026 i was very surprised to hear he was coming out with tv ads so early
6523027 it tells me his three or four year campaign has not really taken effect in the 25th congressional district i think his name recognition is low i think his campaign is truly worried
6523028 the time has come for me to step down and leave public office
6523029 ive been a part of public policy for twenty years at one level or another and i think its natural its a natural progression it gives you the experience of being able to listen to people make decisions and stand by those decisions
6523030 to put ourselves back on the map back on the economic map nationwide and back on the map of young people young professionals who may leave the area as i did once but may have an opportunity to come back and convince them and convince us in central new york that this can be a wonderful place to raise a family and a wonderful place to do business and a wonderful place just to live
6523031 they only talk amongst themselves to their staffers and they get insulated and they forget what its like to live in the real world its a mess washington is broken
6523032 im one of these folks i dont pretend to be anyone else
6523033 my opponent has spent the majority of his adult life as a staffer in the halls of congress and that experience is not the real world
6523034 the idea that somehow if you go somewhere else and you achieve things other places that youre disqualified from serving your own community thats ridiculous
6523035 and if thats true then were not going to have the kind of representation in washington that this community really needs to really thrive because we do need a congressman who knows what hes doing that can find his office and knows how to get things done and not just sit there and introduce bills that dont go anywhere
6523036 i wouldnt want to run for county executive or mayor or governor those positions wouldnt suit my particular qualities
6523037 but this job i do believe i can make a contribution maybe where nobody else can im not a huge ego i dont believe that i know anyone elses business but this particular job i have really the best kind of background for and the best energy to do it and that its maybe a calling
6523038 ive always done the work put my head down and said im going to do the best i can
6523039 im going to make darn sure i can look myself in the mirror every morning and live up to what my grandfather and my father thought i should be
6523040 the campaigns 2nd quarter numbers represent nearly a two and a half fold increase on its previous quarter and a three fold increase on its 4th quarter 2007 results
6523041 its impossible for us to raise 900 000 before the election lets be real
6523042 but this race isnt about which candidate has the fattest wallet what we have is a very good platform and a candidate who can express himself in a way that leaves no question who the better candidate is
6523043 im deeply humbled by the strong grass roots support my campaign is receiving
6523044 i am certain that our support will continue to grow and we will achieve victory in november
6523045 republican candidates continue to post impressive fundraising numbers in some of the most competitive races in the country
6523046 none of us believe that government can solve all of our problems but we all demand that government create a system in which we can solve our own
6523047 a congress who over the past years have rubber stamped this presidents agenda to the point where america now almost 3 to 1 is saying its time to go in a new direction
6523048 i believe careers in public service whether it be teaching nursing or serving in the military are vital to keeping our communities strong and helping move new york forward
6523049 now im running for congress because i know if we stay and fight together we can make upstate new york great again
6523050 we have a mountain to climb we have four months to make this happen but fortunately what we have with dale sweetland is he has a proven record of public service when you meet dale sweetland you would ask yourself why cant all of our candidates give me this feel of honor and integrity and hard work
6523051 were setting up events and just getting dale sweetland in front of the people
6523052 we dont have some washington firm doing all our filing data for us so we dont have all of our final numbers just yet
6523053 were going to see some positive activity out of washington
6523054 its a lot of points its not a drop in the bucket
6523055 what dan maffei neglects to mention in his ad is that he worked as a capitol hill staffer for the author of the very tax policies that crippled businesses in his own hometown
6523056 i think it is safe to say that he is out of touch with the interests and values of the district he wants to represent
6523057 there is an incredible mountain that we have to scale
6523058 in all my years on campaigns i have never seen radio or tv spots come out right after the fourth
6523059 its surprising but its a good sign that they are concerned
6523060 he really hasnt experienced the struggle a lot of us have
6523061 we need to be able to communicate dans message of change and a new direction for central and upstate new york to as many people as possible between now and november
6523062 voters are anxious to hear what the candidates have to say now not later dan maffei wants to get his message about jobs and a new direction for upstate new york out to the voters every chance he gets the ads will tell dans story and begin to lay out his plans to bring jobs back to central and upstate new york
6523063 i have traveled across this district countless times and talked to so many people over the last several months and i learned so much
6523064 we need jobs we need to rein in soaring gas prices and we need to finally end the war in iraq most people agree with my message and thats why i have garnered such strong financial support there is no doubt this region has suffered tremendously over the past eight years but the people of this district are resilient and i know we can do better if we have the courage to change
6523065 who espouse aggressive policies to achieve total victory in the war on terror
6523066 settle has everything i admire in a great band poetry tunefulness originality and vision all pursued recklessly as if the whole thing might fall apart at any second and you can dance to it
6523067 its time to put aside the failed policies of the past and start moving in a new direction by encouraging companies like iberdrola to locate here and making the necessary investments that will grow this industry
6523068 instead some psc members have taken a decidedly hostile view toward this project which i find baffling we are poised to become a world class leader in the field of wind generation both in terms of actual energy production and the businesses that serve them iberdrola has made significant upgrades to this deal its time for the psc to get on board
6523069 the soaring cost of energy and gasoline are driving up the prices regular consumers have to pay at the pump and now for everything else too while oil companies reap record profits folks are facing increasing rates of inflation and stagnant wages its time washington stop doing favors for big oil and find ways to ease the burden people across the country are feeling so acutely
6523070 republicans national challenge to defend their house of representatives seats is no more pronounced than in monroe county where democrats could take two open seats in the 25th district which is based in syracuse and stretches into webster irondequoit and penfield democrat dan maffei pronounced ma fay 40 has been running for the seat for about four years his opponent dale sweetland enjoys name recognition as the former onondaga county legislature chairman and a 2007 candidate for countywide office but he got started late and has raised about a tenth of the campaign funds raised by maffei
6523071 when drug companies increase the cost of life saving drugs 10 fold overnight congress is obligated to step up some members are already doing that and i applaud their efforts but more must be done to ensure no one goes untreated while drug companies try to explain away these ridiculous increases as necessary if i am elected to congress i will demand explanations from the drug companies and fight for regular people who cannot afford such outrageous prices
6523072 now is not the time to remove incentives for producing alternative energy
6523073 it is important that congress make passage of these tax credits a top priority when it reconvenes new windfarms including businesses that serve this industry have the potential to be a significant economic engine to this area companies that are making new investments in alternative energy need to know the government is serious about supporting them and the ptc cannot be allowed to expire
6523074 in towns such as dewitt where maffei makes his home voters would consistently back democrats for president senate and sometimes governor but they would still elect moderate republicans who closely monitored constituents moods to local offices in odd year elections
6523075 suddenly this once republican town is voting democratic in off years
6523076 though the area is shifting to the democrats its still a very moderate area
6523077 suddenly this once republican town is voting democratic in off years
6523078 i think the same thing you saw in the south with democrats in the 70s and 80s youre seeing in the northeast now with republicans
6523079 what youve seen is that republicans were successful in the northeast when they were a more moderate to liberal party
6523080 in 2006 that race was not necessarily a race about jim walsh
6523081 it was about an unpopular president and an unpopular war
6523082 people dont bring iraq up to me nearly as much as they did with jim walsh two years ago these folks in this district many of them are still upset with president bush but president bush isnt going to be there on the ballot
6523083 energy costs are brutal its very hard to be competitive
6523084 stepping up to the plate and knocking it out of the park
6523085 the latino audience doesnt want to be pandered to or else theyll turn off
6523086 documentary is always going to be really special to me
6523087 i think thats the way we tell stories in real life
6523088 artistically speaking i treated the new daughter like a short film but two hours long in english and with kevin costner
6523089 the latino audience doesnt want to be pandered to or else theyll turn off
6523090 met a lot of people and wanted to tell their stories
6523091 i am honored to have the support of so many people who share a vision that brings new ideas for the people of upstate new york
6523092 for too long central new york has suffered a slow and steady economic decline and our elected leaders have been unable to find solutions its time for this to change i was born and raised right here in central new york and i know firsthand the issues we face and the need to bring good paying jobs with benefits to our region
6523093 i want to come up with a plan now because i want voters to know what i intend to do in washington and want to be ready to act on a plan the moment i get there
6523094 actually some other people have come down theyve talked to me i havent heard anything yet this has been in the last three weeks but like i said its an open process
6523095 i believe the middle class are the engine of americas economy and when they prosper and have confidence in the future we succeed
6523096 george bush and his allies still think the economy is doing fine and they are dead set against any change i recognize that our economy has changed and that even the basic rules for middle class prosperity and security have changed with it my plan is aimed at getting our economy moving and to restoring prosperity and confidence
6523097 i think people saw maffei beating walsh in onondaga county and thought they could do it a lot of people are running where no one would try before
6523098 rep jim walshs retirement gives democrats a chance to continue to consolidate their death grip on the northeast in the fall
6523099 it looks like syracuse mayor matt driscoll wont run a classical political hamlet and that decision should clear the democratic field for maffei
6523100 we felt that if we get in there early and were able to explain to our working men and women what the issues are what the candidates stand is on the issues that candidate has a better chance of getting the vote of union members in this district
6523101 the working people of this community know that because of this endorsement they know that i am the candidate thats going to really create jobs and make sure that there are really good jobs in this area good jobs that will attract young people attract new business in the future thats the key and the earlier that message can be delivered the better
6523102 if you see a fork in the road take it
6523103 well why are you here you have a good education and a lot of opportunities to do something somewhere else
6523104 this is going to be a tremendous campaign this is going to be a campaign for change a new direction in central new york the fact that all of you are here today on a cold snowy day having left your televisions and the carrier dome just minutes before just honors me tremendously
6523105 i never thought i would stay in washington this long ever
6523106 for the last four or five years ive wrestled with the idea of retirement
6523107 a lot of people are disappointed and a lot of them are shocked
6523108 its going to take awhile for someone else from this area to be able to do these types of things
6523109 what will happen is that people will realize these are the golden days and theyre gone
6523110 i suspect theres going to be a lot of interest on both sides
6523111 i will be very generous to the republican party locally and nationally i will try to be very helpful to our candidate here and to the party
6523112 i voted to go to war and not to go to war i voted to impeach a president i witnessed our capital under attack i will never forget as long as i live seeing the pentagon on fire outside my office window
6523113 our projected value of each point is in excess of 1 900
6523114 it is unprecedented that claims can begin going out in an eight month period
6523115 he convinced me his ankle was severely injured so much so that he couldnt bear to let it touch the floor
6523116 of course i took him to the emergency room where they could find absolutely nothing wrong
6523117 and began hoisting the other one as he crawled gingerly across the floor
6523118 this was not only stupid but as i said a disgusting thing to do to children
6523119 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess
6523120 i dont like that they are trying to tell me what to do
6523121 at pedi desculpas porque aquele n o era o momento mas vou continuar tentando fazer ele aprender o samba assim como ele vai procurar me ensinar o tango
6523122 o dalessandro um grande jogador mas tem muita coisa que aprender do brasil al m do samba estou tentando ajudar ele a falar bem o portugu s s vezes ele n o entende a gente
6523123 n o sei o que est acontecendo at dirigindo eu sinto dor j estou desconfiado que isso coisa de trabalho feito
6523124 spending time indoors where there are no insects and dude is there wireless up there because it is the color of my needs
6523125 we will pick up seats in the next election even our colleagues on the other side recognize that
6523126 i think it qualifies me more than a lot of people to have spent 14 years learning about those programs and watching what effect all those programs have on people
6523127 i sit i think like many people do and watch people point fingers try to lay blame at everyone elses feet
6523128 i think its my heritage in growing up on a farm and farming all my life and knowing that if you dont do something its not likely someone will come along and do your job for you
6523129 its one of the ways you can really change things
6523130 nobody is perfect i do believe charlie rangel is a great american
6523131 whatever is thought if it was worth thinking must be written down at once
6523132 a first attempt to lay out some of the evidence and methods
6523133 to read the gospels as precisely the kind of text we need in order to recognize the disclosure of god in the history of jesus
6523134 the coinherence of fact and meaning empirical report and engaged interpretation was not a problem for these historians
6523135 perhaps no better example is representative james t walsh a 10 term republican from new york who announced in january that he would retire when his term expired mr walsh has a key role over appropriations and is a fixture in his syracuse area district making him a formidable candidate to challenge but with mr walsh out of the way democrats appear to be in a strong position to pick up his seat in part because of the fund raising advantage held by dan maffei the democratic candidate mr maffei who lost to mr walsh by about 3 400 votes in 2006 has nearly 1 million in his campaign account compared with nearly 110 000 raised by his republican opponent dale sweetland a former county legislator
6523136 energy independence is not realistic im not sure its even desirable
6523137 the fact of the matter is four days after he sent me the letter saying we should engage in some debates he got a hand delivered letter from us saying absolutely
6523138 absolutely received a letter from the sweetland campaign back in july and since then weve been waiting for a conversation to have to talk about debates
6523139 theyre critical to this race and we want to have them and we want to have the conversation so people can hear where the candidates stand on the issues
6523140 i dont know what kind of political ploy dan wants to play but you know lets go
6523141 the issue set and the audience were decidedly different a couple of hours later when maffei went to the mostly black southside neighborhood for a roundtable with local residents and business owners at a community resource center
6523142 the southside of syracuse is a place of endless potential that has so far at least in the last several decades been unrealized
6523143 maffei told the group of about 20 at the southside community resource center that if elected he will push for changes in the federal empowerment zone tax credit to make it more beneficial for syracuse businesses
6523144 a democrat hoping to replace republican congressman james walsh after this novembers elections says he wants input on how to turn the local economy around dan maffei is launching a series of meetings to discuss economic development maffei met with community members on tuesday on syracuses southside an area ravaged by high unemployment and business closings he says there is a chance to turn things around
6523145 at a time when americans are paying 4 a gallon gas and areas like central and upstate new york are hemorrhaging jobs this news is particularly galling the bush administration told us at the beginning of this war that reconstruction would be paid for by iraq through oil revenue we need to help the iraqi people get back on their feet but we also have pressing needs here at home
6523146 theres no doubt that the management in detroit has been slow to switch
6523147 the heartburn if you will is weve got a recently ratified contract and now management wants to open it back up
6523148 were looking for ways for the company to save money without cutting pay
6523149 the southside of syracuse is a place of endless potential that has so far at least in the last several decades been unrealized
6523150 i know for a fact that my criminal background is whats stifling me from actually obtaining employment what can i do about that
6523151 we are grateful for these brave men and womens service are thankful to their families for their shared sacrifice the 174th fighter wings safe arrival home is a relief now we must work to bring the war in iraq to an end by drawing down our troop level in a timely and responsible manner the bush administrations poor planning has stretched our service men and women reservists and their families to the breaking point it is past time to bring them all home for good
6523152 the marcellus shale formation has the added bonus of bringing jobs and economic development to upstate new york in congress i will do all i can to encourage investment in these types of responsible projects that begin to move us away from our oil addiction and toward a more secure energy future
6523153 it is critical that unions and businesses work together like cwa ibew did with verizon to not only keep jobs here but expand employment opportunities in the area
6523154 we are grateful for these brave men and womens service are thankful to their families for their shared sacrifice the 174th fighter wings safe arrival home is a relief now we must work to bring the war in iraq to an end by drawing down our troop level in a timely and responsible manner the bush administrations poor planning has stretched our service men and women reservists and their families to the breaking point it is past time to bring them all home for good
6523155 progress is moving along but at this pace the company will drag it out to christmas
6523156 we want to be full participants in this corporation moving forward
6523157 weve been denied access in the growth sectors of this corporation
6523158 there could be a dramatic political realignment in the northeast if republicans dont head it off right now
6523159 the exclamation point on this years congressional elections is that republicans dont have a competitive candidate on staten island
6523160 the staten island republican party has been renowned for producing powerful politicians for years for decades
6523161 suddenly this once republican town is voting democratic in off years
6523162 though the area is shifting to the democrats its still a very moderate area
6523163 the difference has been where the national democratic party has gone and to a certain extent the state parties
6523164 and the parking tickets who is the parking ticket nazi here
6523165 in no other seat did republican chances collapse as much and as quickly as in this staten island seat
6523166 exxon mobil is padding the pockets of speculators where they should focus on u s production
6523167 instead of idly watching the american economy suffocate under the weight of gas prices exxon needs to spend significantly more on research and development in the vast areas where they are already permitted to drill and have failed to take any action

6523171 by the end of the 22nd we will pull back to the checkpoints line
6523172 most regions have seen strong growth for the first six months of 2008 which is a great result for the industry given the current economic uncertainties facing the global economy
6523173 the region also had the highest occupancy and average room rates in the world at 75 3 percent and us 180 respectively
6523174 the strength of some currencies against the us dollar notably the euro is presenting a challenge for the hotel industry particularly in europe which is likely to see a downturn in visitor numbers from the us and uk during the remainder of the year the us will continue to benefit from an influx in both european and asian travellers but the positive impact of inbound visitors is unlikely to offset the downward pressure as a result of the weakening economy the middle east looks set for a fifth consecutive year of double digit growth and asia is also well placed to have another strong year

6523192 i think that being an independent is an advantage in the current political climate i believe that people are ready for an independent thinker in fact i think that most voters are like me and do not agree 100 with either major party
6523193 this includes safe onshore drilling migration to hybrid and electric vehicles while continuing to develop all types of alternate and renewable energy
6523194 in order to ensure that any investigation of the allegations is fair and free from any question of interference or influence i am taking a leave of absence effective immediately for the duration of the investigation
6523195 it has to be dealt with because it hurts business it hurts people and it hurts the business that these companies are doing
6523196 small business cant absorb the rising costs as well as big business can
6523197 a really vibrant community will see that big businesses and universities and colleges are spinning off a lot of little businesses like retail small manufacturing and boutique firms thats how an economy really gets going
6523198 the southside of syracuse is a place of endless potential that has so far at least in the past several decades has been unrealized its an unrealized potential that we absolutely have to change if were going to see a good future in all of our community
6523199 i am conducting these roundtable meetings throughout the district to listen to concerns and ideas from local business owners on how to make these programs work for central and upstate new york
6523200 we need to discuss ideas on what we can do as a community not only to bring new jobs to the region but also to help existing businesses grow expand and protect their employees
6523201 this government really is failing its veteran and has been for a number of years now and something needs to be done about it
6523202 between 2005 and 2006 the number of veterans returning seeking primary care nearly doubled from 15 000 to 30 000 wait times are longer than 6 months some for soldiers with ptsd that is unacceptable
6523203 i send numerous e mails and make numerous phone calls on a weekly basis just trying to manage my healthcare if you dont have the time or the measures to do that a lot of people just give up
6523204 mandatory full funding of the veterans administration this is a legislative concept that takes the funding of the va out of the discretionary budget and makes it mandatory
6523205 at the end of the day this race is going to be about making sure central new york has a new economy regardless of how much money is raised
6523206 i dont think its a game to say who can raise the most money
6523207 in the end its a method of spending the money wisely and making a connection with voters weve seen races before where people have been outspent and somebody has surprised them
6523208 being able to raise money is going to be very important i have experience raising money
6523209 for far too long congressman jim walsh has been playing politics with this failed war and our troops have suffered the consequences
6523210 this forum will give central new yorkers a chance to discuss their feelings and to show jim walsh there is true opposition to this failed war
6523211 i saw someone characterize our profits the other day in terms of 1 400 in profit per second
6523212 well they also need to understand we paid 4 000 a second in taxes and we spent 15 000 a second in cost we spend 1 billion a day just running our business so this is a business where large numbers are just characteristic of it
6523213 sean hannity and george w bush are war propagandists who are more concerned with their bank accounts than conservative principles
6523214 we now know how much sean hannitys soul was worth
6523215 the fact that sean hannity still supports president bush and the war in iraq clearly shows that he is in the pocket of the white house and is most likely involved in operation mockingbird a cia program to influence domestic media in favor of government agendas
6523216 i used to support president bush and the war until i found out that we had been repeatedly lied to
6523217 anyone who still supports this president is either completely ignorant or a paid propagandist and sean hannity is not stupid
6523218 we will no longer listen to your mindless heartless jabber
6523219 no se trata de una acci n punitiva pero s es una clara demostraci n del compromiso de un sector de la sociedad junto al gobierno bonaerense en trabajar para que los ciudadanos est n un poquito m s seguros todos los d as
6523220 a timely opportunity for catholics to join the pope and return to the bible as the source of parish and personal renewal
6523221 theres a whole lot more pressure on retailers to hold back price increases and theres less pressure when prices are coming down so theyre able to expand margins
6523222 the reality is if the retailer didnt start expanding margins right now youre not going to see that station open much longer
6523223 many gasoline stations are now trying to recapture some of the lost margins as the cost of gasoline comes down
6523224 we still have some of that to get passed through we still have certainly more than a dime to go probably more than that
6523225 over the last month the supermarkets have played a large part in bringing prices down by forcing other retailers to bring prices down too
6523226 we have seen prices come down faster than we have following previous spikes in the price of oil but there is still room for prices to fall
6523227 its typical that at retail level when wholesale gasoline prices and the price of oil goes up they tend to get passed on more quickly than when prices are coming down
6523228 over the long term prices will come back down due to competitive market pressures
6523229 you can only try to make up for your losses as long as someone else doesnt beat you by a couple of cents a gallon because customer loyalty today only lasts until the next fill up
6523230 my recent remarks may have been mistakenly construed as a call to rescind the colorado river compact and commence negotiations for new water allocations let me be clear that i do not advocate renegotiation of the compact

6523234 in the process of securing comments for recommending the book i believe there was a basic misunderstanding on my part that the comments were publishable
6523235 were intended for me personally rather than for the general public
6523236 general petraeus has by his own hand become a quintessential poster child of this fundamentalist christian religious predation via his unadulterated and shocking public endorsement of a book touting both christian supremacy and exceptionalism
6523237 he should still be relieved of duty and court martialed
6523238 the name we have chosen is inspired by your book and by the intoxicating world of tiki culture the music the fun history the drinks the atmosphere that means that you cant help but feel intoxicated
6523239 we didnt include the name tiki in our first attempt at a tiki bar
6523240 there are other beach bars around town that have no tiki inspiration we felt that we need to smoothly introduce the tiki idea to copenhagen so they understand that we are not just another beach bar
6523241 copenhagen is loving the tiki drinks they still need to get used to the fact that something that can taste so great can be so dangerous and we have had a couple of casualties one of our guests started a facebook page about the entertainment a volcano bowl can bring
6523242 unless theyre in the know if someone lists one of these on ebay theyre not really going to know what its history is
6523243 i was pretty shocked that nobody else jumped on it it pretty much flew under the radar i did take it to the mai kai this weekend and i showed it to kern he was pretty surprised to see one

6523249 i have great respect for governor spitzer but i do not

6523260 the first one with jimmy carter was a new experience for me although he did not carry new jersey
6523261 people were throwing peanuts around the convention hall and everything had a newness for me though now its a little bit stale
6523262 i was for hillary and i still am for hillary but if the consensus is for obama we should stop badmouthing him
6523263 i get things on the email all the time members of the delegation telling me why i should continue to vote for hillary
6523264 they need to stop obamas a good candidate and in this matter i think the younger people see this better than we do obama has the vision imagination and courage and thats what the countrys lacking right now
6523265 hes entitled to his view and i look forward to welcoming him to my wedding in new jersey in 2009 honestly if hed like to be in the wedding party hes more than welcome

6523270 stephen farquharson immigration and custom enforcement ice boston regional office to declare a moratorium on immigration raids in rhode island the clergy also encouraged ice to allow agents to excuse themselves from participating in raids if such actions are not in conformity with their faith and conscience
6523271 the bishop and pastors met at blessed sacrament parish in providence on tuesday afternoon to assess the current situation with the immigrants in various communities throughout the diocese determine their needs and discuss possible diocesan assistance
6523272 we the undersigned urge you to declare a moratorium on immigration raids in the state of rhode island until our nation can implement a comprehensive and just reform of our immigration laws
6523273 it is our hope that such reform will make immigration raids obsolete until then we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counter productive

6523277 it is to the public detriment to fuel an industry where women are degraded and treated as sex objects
6523278 if private companies want to engage in such activity its not criminal in this nation and theyre free to do so but for the government to use to public resource to promote such degradation shows how detached the bureaucracy is from the canadian people
6523279 that to us is corrupting minds and getting them hooked on this material
6523280 we would be happy if they did but we understand the parameters in which they operate and we dont anticipate they will make such a move
6523281 one of the most intriguing examples being predictions of voting decisions
6523282 one could say that people sometimes have already made up their mind even though they do not know it yet
6523283 that is better than zero which is where we are now
6523284 the human mind operates largely out of the view of its owners
6523285 we would be stuck pondering every little decision such as whether to put our left or right foot forward first as the world sped by
6523286 we are often strangers to ourselves unable to observe directly the working of our own minds
6523287 junkies and drug pushers dont belong near children and families they should be in rehab and behind bars

6523290 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6523291 if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6523292 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6523293 as we look to expand the ea sports brand and captivate sports fans from around the world with rich new interactive experiences it was obvious that the renaissance were seeing in the sport of tennis provides us with a big opportunity
6523294 our new tennis franchise coming first to the wii will put fans right into the action and provide the excitement tension and drama that true champions feel in legendary matches like the classic from wimbledon just last month
6523295 while hillcrest labs has a great deal of respect for nintendo and the wii hillcrest labs believes that nintendo is in clear violation of its patents and has taken this action to protect its intellectual property rights

6523303 this seems to be based on the idea that the government can take a bunch of data and create a profile that can be used to identify future bad guys

6523310 the texas association of builders is disappointed that the sunset commission staff has recommended throwing the residential construction industry in this state back to a time when there was no regulation at all of the industry with no corresponding ability to prevent bad actors from continuing to harm texas consumers

6523342 you know the position but i cannot tell you much more
6523343 but we are not in a desperate situation because we have song back from the olympics diaby does not look too far away and hopefully we can good news from tomas rosicky in the next two weeks
6523344 we are not short short but one more body is possible
6523345 i believe once somebody cannot play for you in europe it devalues the player for the season but it is not necessarily stopping you from buying a player
6523346 i felt manchester united had made up their mind to let him go before we were interested to maybe manchester city or to france so it was not necessarily us going in there and buying a player
6523347 he can play centre back he can play left back and that is an area where we were a bit inexperienced
6523348 he has a great team attitude and he can help us in the dressing room as well with his maturity
6523349 you know how important he is on the creative side of our game and you want him to be in the team but we do not want to face a gamble for just one game and we have to be patient
6523350 we will have to asses him on monday or tuesday to see how big a gamble it will be to start him or not
6523351 football raises a lot of money and if you can help other people you should
6523352 a club has a social responsibility maybe in england more than anywhere else because here a club grew out of its environment within a city

6523356 defendants exposed the yield plus fund to investments in low quality debt securities creating an inappropriate level of risk far out of line with the stated investment objectives of the f w webb 401k plan and those of a traditional money market fund
6523357 that stability of the yield plus fund might not have a stable value was never discussed at these meetings with state street and citistreet
6523358 believing that the yield plus fund continued to have the stability of a money market fund and was a relatively risk free investment for its participants and based on its satisfactory performance over time plaintiffs had no reason to question the advisability of inclusion of the yield plus fund in the f w webb 401 k plan
6523359 to make matters worse during the 2005 2007 timeframe ssga in violation of its fiduciary duties and with wanton disregard for the interests of the f w webb 401 k plan participants chose to invest the yield plus fund heavily in risky financial instruments such as low quality mortgage backed bonds supported by subprime home loans and other illiquid asset backed securities
6523360 these high risk low quality investments directly exposed the yield plus fund to the volatility of the subprime mortgage market at the time when it was publicly reported that defaults of subprime mortgages were skyrocketing and that numerous subprime lenders were facing insolvency

6523376 this is incredible i always believed in the team although we had a rough time for a while particularly when we were losing 2 0 but having reached the final in this way is incredible
6523377 this team plays with its heart but today it also showed evidence of a strong head

6523381 the fact that the saddleback civil forum on the presidency took place at all is a sign that both parties intend to fight for the votes of religious christians
6523382 little noticed is language in this years draft democratic platform that strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to health care income support and adoption programs
6523383 era of reducing christianity to a narrow set of ideological commitments is over

6523391 reflected not so much a civil forum as a push for a theocratic presidency one that would be deeply influenced by warrens evangelism

6523395 this past saturday we had our first inter squad scrimmage of the 2008 pre season camp the scrimmage consisted of approximately 100 plays including special teams and ended with a red zone competition which has a specific scoring system to determine a winner
6523396 overall the scrimmage was good but as to be expected with any first real game situation there were some minor mistakes
6523397 there is no doubt that this team is giant steps ahead of the team it was a year ago at this point and with the leadership and work ethic of all those involved that will hopefully be shown on the field this season
6523398 this day it was the defense who won the compete zone but it was been an ongoing battle every day

6523403 as much as upshaw was labeled a fighter a line in the sand leader he sought common ground he sought consensus he would hold a match in one hand and a hose in the other he could flip back and forth with effectiveness his passion for his players was real his passion to lead was real
6523404 but behind the laugh was a man who cared about the players and also understood that a cooperative working relationship with the league was the best way to get things done some players felt his relationship with paul tagliabue and roger goodell was too close for comfort but i say he kept it professional at all times and the proof is in the rise of salaries and benefits the players have received while he was in charge
6523405 he was tenacious battling toe to toe with powerful titans of corporate america

6523442 were going to try to identify the strain that is making people sick
6523443 how exactly long that will take is very hard to tell right now
6523444 right now we only have one death thats confirmed and once we have the meat and confirm that we are looking at more deaths from the outbreak we will let you know
6523445 if you think you have the tainted meat get rid of it immediately
6523446 that would be a little bit of an overkill from my perspective that would be overly cautious
6523447 thats the reason for us putting out the public alert so if anybody remembers eating that meat somewhere and gets sick then they can maybe go to their physician
6523448 at the end of the day it this recall could happen to anybody and fortunately it didnt happen to us

6523455 then gore starts running up the popular vote in california and i lost on both accounts
6523456 markets are different than polls in that they dont ask how you would vote
6523457 but they ask how you think everyone will vote come november
6523458 it was a conversation we had at lunch the next day
6523459 we were chatting about what the polls were saying going into michigan and said that if the futures markets in chicago predicted like polls those markets wouldnt exist
6523460 theres interest in franken coleman for a couple of reasons first the markets work best when theres an incumbent running against another person what we look for in markets is people paying attention and here you have a contested race that also features a celebrity
6523461 its a pretty high profile race with two high profile candidates
6523462 if it was coleman ciresi we probably wouldnt do this
6523463 to us a success means a market thats an accurate predictor
6523464 we need more people and minnesota people in the market
6523465 people have an incentive to get it right it gives them an incentive to make money also polls dont predict how a race will actually turn out we think its important to put money on the table but how much tends not to matter
6523466 weve had people from wall street who do this every day for high stakes do our markets at the end of the day
6523467 then if it comes up to 50 ill sell it and then figure out what to do
6523468 es que la nena me dijo que quer a xyz

6523472 i was suffering too when i left you those messages crying and begging u to please let me know something and u didnt bother to do so
6523473 jessi i need some time for myself i will be busy this week and we wont be able to talk
6523474 ya no me creo tus excusas mauri porque para tus amigos si tuviste tiempo y sabes q si no tienes tiempo para una novia no la tengas b scate otro juguete estoy cansada de escuchar siempre las mismas excusas las mismas promesas y las mismas falsas esperanzas de que vas a luchar por m sin que lo hagas estoy cansada de que todo sea m s importante que yo y de que siempre te quedes de brazos cruzados y te rindas a la primera porque no tienes cojones para luchar y para defenderte estoy cansada de que siempre intentes hacer cosas pero nunca las hagas estoy cansada de que intentes siempre tomar las decisiones correctas a n cuando sabes que there arent any rights or wrongs just different options and that no matter what you do somebody will be hurt at the end you have decided to hurt me because your life with your parents is more important than my relationship with you so i have to respect that pero no esperes que lo acepte y que lo permita porque yo quiero a mi lado a un hombre que me de el lugar que me corresponde y t no has sido capaz de hacerlo

6523476 the chinese army again fired on a crowd on monday august 18 in the kham region in eastern tibet
6523477 he clearly stated that we had no specific information on the number of casualties
6523478 we have been told that there have been casualties but we are not able to verify what casualties means whether people have been killed or whether they have been injured
6523479 reliable witnesses say that 400 people have been killed in the region of the tibetan capital lhasa alone
6523480 killed by bullets even though they were protesting without weapons their bodies were never given back to their families if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
6523481 ten thousand people have been arrested we dont know where they are imprisoned
6523482 a project of long term brutal repression is under way

6523503 1 of religion in general as amidst several degrees of darkness we may form a judgment of those which are the least thick and among precipices which are the least deep so we may search among false religions for those that are most conformable to the welfare of society for those which though they have not the effect of leading men to the felicity of another life may contribute most to their happiness in this i shall examine therefore the several religions of the world in relation only to the good they produce in civil society whether i speak of that which has its root in heaven or of those which spring from the earth as in this work i am not a divine but a political writer i may here advance things which are not otherwise true than as they correspond with a worldly manner of thinking not as considered in their relation to truths of a more sublime nature with regard to the true religion a person of the least degree of impartiality must see that i have never pretended to make its interests submit to those of a political nature but rather to unite them now in order to unite it is necessary that we should know them the christian religion which ordains that men should love each other would without doubt have every nation blest with the best civil the best political laws because these next to this religion are the greatest good that men can give and receive
6523504 he was a soldiers soldier and that was his path that was his lifes dream to be a soldier

6523506 it means the average worker in ontario has less purchasing power than they did a year ago
6523507 certainly all the evidence points to the labour market going from bad to worse in ontario and that is likely to limit future wage increases
6523508 ontarios inflation really has jumped up quite quickly in the last few months and the wage increases have really slowed down
6523509 gasoline prices were the main factor behind the climb in consumer prices from july 2007 to july 2008

6523530 the unm foundation received gifts from more than 20 000 donors in one years time
6523531 one hundred percent of gifts to the unm foundation provide support to achieve the mission and work of unm

6523538 there was an altercation involving an unknown male who obviously threw something through a window
6523539 there was a smash it the object must have been alight because it ignited the curtains and the house went up
6523540 i was there eight minutes later and it was just destroyed
6523541 through their heroics they entered there and retrieved one male who was nearly unconscious he was unable to get out on his own
6523542 they went back in to retrieve the woman couldnt find her and they found she gained access to the rear of the premises and was in the back yard
6523543 we wont know what he threw through the window until the forensics get there we dont know if he had some sort of accelerant or if things just went up themselves

6523568 its a little bit of a surprise how strong some of the numbers were in july
6523569 weve been waiting for some moderation but especially with some of the meat prices and how much has come through relatively recently at the retail level leads me to believe the overall number may be a little bit higher for the year
6523570 we need to get the word out that this is likely to happen but as a practical matter leases have been signed and properties bought for this school year

6523578 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6523579 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
6523580 to date the cftc has found that supply and demand fundamentals offer the best explanation for the systematic rise in oil prices
6523581 regardless of their classification the cftcs market surveillance group scrutinizes daily the positions of all large traders both commercial and non commercial to guard against market manipulation
6523582 when the cftc granted the 1991 hedging exemption to j aron a division of goldman sachs it signaled a major shift that has since allowed investors to accumulate enormous positions for purely speculative purposes
6523583 legitimate businesses that hedge and take physical delivery of oil are being trampled by the speculators who are in the market purely to make profit

6523588 we believe that one of the different biomarkers we have discovered may be sued to help detect skin cancer in a new and non invasive manner

6523596 we have a lot of work to do but this is a talented group well be working with it will be exciting to watch their progress this fall
6523597 we are concerned by recent reports that the chinese have detained protesters
6523598 we call on china to respect the fundamental and universally recognised right of all persons to peacefully express their views including chinese citizens and we urge the chinese to put their best face forward during these olympic games
6523599 beijing police decided to give thomas and the five others 10 days of administrative detention
6523600 these young men were in beijing to amplify tibetan voices calling for freedom and human rights and the right of all people to freedom of expression
6523601 they are no more guilty of a crime than tibetans or chinese who speak out for justice
6523602 for the chinese authorities to sentence them at all shows the governments paranoia and intolerance of even the most peaceful challenges to its control

6523649 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

6523654 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6523655 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6523656 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6523657 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6523658 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6523659 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6523660 who are open to doing something on the production side
6523661 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6523662 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6523663 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6523664 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6523665 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6523666 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6523667 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6523668 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6523669 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6523670 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6523671 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6523672 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6523673 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6523674 because after the kids were finished the whole house smelled like chuck it was so wonderful

6523681 we will host a russian missile system in our country to counter the us
6523682 my vp wont be like that other vice president who thinks he is above the law
6523683 we understand what is behind russias position we believe this is a response to georgian provocation we support moscow in this and are against any attempts to blacken russia
6523684 to consider the offers of the syrian government in connection of the delivery of new weapons only for defence purposes
6523685 we are not going to slam the door on nato nato could slam this door though everything depends on natos priorities if the priorities are absolutely supportive of saakashvilis bankrupt regime to the detriment of partnership with russia then it is not our fault
6523686 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6523687 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6523688 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6523689 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6523690 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6523691 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6523692 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6523693 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6523694 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6523695 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6523696 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6523697 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6523698 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6523699 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6523700 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline

6523702 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6523703 how to make them obey and when they need a spanken
6523704 there are some to whom our ways seem quaint but today of all days it is brought home to me that it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life
6523705 excuse me your excellency but are there any dwarf nuns in rome
6523706 your worship are there any dwarf nuns in all of europe
6523707 no dopey there are no dwarf nuns in all of europe
6523708 mr pope are there any dwarf nuns in the whole world
6523709 im sorry my son there are no dwarf nuns anywhere in the world
6523710 life often feels simpler without these issues and its easier to eat a whole bag of potato chips and retreat to your fatter safer world
6523711 enroll in a public speaking class to build self esteem and increase your comfort level around people
6523712 maybe youre energetic or you smile a lot or regale your friends with funny stories thinking in terms of confidence and strength makes you act in terms of confidence and strength
6523713 blaming your tardiness on a hectic schedule is easier than admitting youre resentful about constraints being placed on your time
6523714 rather than risk a poor showing in the new position you ensure that the opportunity never arises
6523715 if its a career issue ask yourself if your interest in your job is waning
6523716 being late is a way of disconnecting this can be a warning that its time to take stock and either recommit yourself or make a change
6523717 i cant help it he used to be great but now hes just driving me crazy
6523718 you end up fearing that just as youre ready to make a commitment your partner will see your true self and find a reason to not love you
6523719 its like changing the rearview mirror in your car if you rotate it just a little bit you get a whole new perspective
6523720 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6523721 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6523722 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6523723 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6523724 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6523725 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6523726 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6523727 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6523728 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6523729 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6523730 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6523731 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6523732 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6523733 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6523734 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6523735 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6523736 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6523737 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6523738 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6523739 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6523740 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6523741 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6523742 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6523743 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6523744 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6523745 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6523746 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6523747 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6523748 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6523749 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6523750 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6523751 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6523752 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6523753 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6523754 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6523755 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6523756 there comes a time for all of us to choose between what is easy and what is right
6523757 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
6523758 it moves what the rules were from 1993 to the new world we live in but it maintains civil liberties
6523759 provide specialized equipment technical knowledge or assistance of expert personnel
6523760 these measures are not intended as personal affronts on your civil liberties rather they are part of long range policies designed to protect the american people its corporations and government against any and all potential threats and to insure that our strategic interests are kept safe and available i wouldnt worry myself about this if i were you

6523777 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6523778 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6523779 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6523780 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6523781 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6523782 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

6523790 in all topics mr obama displays a similar worried serious looking facial pattern even when talking about more positive subjects his facial expressions do not signal positive affective states
6523791 there is an element of the fact that he is on the edges of his comfort zone here
6523792 going into a presidential campaign is not something he has done before and you could say it is written all over his face
6523793 the dominating attitude as transmitted by his vocal style is that of concern and sincere involvement
6523794 his smile is often not fully developed ie his cheek raising muscles do not participate enough in the expression of positive affect to be perceived as genuine

6523798 i felt his briefing was exactly what the junior soldiers needed to hear
6523799 i thought i was doing something wrong i thought it was all me i had little pieces of the puzzle but i couldnt see the big picture
6523800 the briefing had a bigger impact because it came from a soldier who is going through ptsd rather than a doctor up there briefing a bunch of long words that they junior enlisted soldiers do not understand
6523801 the soldiers can relate to him and his experiences in iraq
6523802 if we can just reach one soldier to get help and then each one of them helps one more

6523844 the elections have led to almost a paranoia on the part of the kremlin administration about who is on television

6523846 the thing that nobody wants to talk about is that we do not have freedom of the press when it comes to the television networks
6523847 my programs with him were among the highest rated programs of any in the history of his show
6523848 they say it is boring it is pro government it is too oriented towards the positions of state agencies of those in power you know i can say that our television in terms of quality in terms of the technology used is i believe one of the best in the world
6523849 these are people who are not interesting for society who are not interesting for journalists
6523850 but they want publicity and perhaps they want to explain away their lack of creative and political success by the fact that they are persecuted that they are included on the so called stop list
6523851 i thought that maybe she forgot to look at the stop list

6523862 everything has been agreed with abdoulaye in fact it was all agreed at the back end of last week
6523863 unfortunately the work permit situation isnt as straightforward because he hasnt played the requisite number of games for the application to go straight through
6523864 however having gone through it with abdoulaye the reason he hasnt played the games is because he has been injured
6523865 we have been in constant contact with the home office and we have got an agreement with them that providing we can prove he wasnt selected because he was injured then they will approve that work permit application
6523866 what we require from that to put it simply is a certification from the international team doctor that he was not fit or available for selection in those games

6523890 i went to a chiropractor the last two days and was doing a bunch of treatment
6523891 the night before i was fine and slept with a harder pillow
6523892 that night i had grabbed a softer one i woke up in the middle of the night jammed up against the headboard
6523893 they were joking that maybe it was better because i am keeping my head on line and not moving it
6523894 they said hey youre not pulling off the ball as much we tried a couple of things out and well see if it works mechanically
6523895 for what its going to be used for fair or foul home runs i think they should probably draw the line somewhere and stop it there
6523896 there are so many parks where there are poles behind the fence and you cant see so it makes it tough for the umpires and i think theyd rather get the call right especially in a playoff atmosphere or world series atmosphere
6523897 i guess it all depends on whether it works in your favor or not
6523898 i think itll be a touchy situation just because theres no real clear call on how theyll make it work if they use it like the nfl and get a tv down there or do something where they can run over and make a quick decision that should work we cant be checking every single play
6523899 thatd be pretty funny he could reach into his sock like patriots coach bill belichick
6523900 i personally dont like it just for the sole fact that when you start bringing computers into the game one thing leads to the next
6523901 theres human error involved from all sides from the players side to the umpires side nobodys perfect
6523902 i know what theyre trying to do is make the game more fair and make sure the calls are right
6523903 these umpires are doing a great job and making sure the calls are right theyre always looking for new ways to improve the game and if they feel this is a good route to go im all for it i personally wouldnt have brought it up
6523904 out and safe and strikes will always be the umpires game
6523905 we might go the whole playoffs without seeing a controversial home run
6523906 theres just so many games during the regular season and so many teams that theres bound to be home runs that arent home runs and vice versa i think the chances of them having to look at a call in the playoffs probably wont happen and at least theyll get it right
6523907 someone said they saw it on replay and said it looked like a home run so ive heard two different things
6523908 the foul ball home run thing even if youre standing there its tough to see
6523909 maybe they should shoot laser beams up there like the espn k zone or something i still think there are going to be some plays that are questionable and replay wont help get it right and move on
6523910 theres no formula to it theres years you have good years and years that you struggle a little bit it seems like everyone has their own ideas and opinions its a crazy game theres guys that have bad years that are great players it just happens for me ive been very fortunate to be on the other side of the spectrum this year having a good year
6523911 we definitely needed some offense manny is gone now me and manny have pretty much been the guys stepping up every year we needed somebody else to get it done like that
6523912 im getting better results but i just think as you get older you try to get better and you try to learn from your mistakes in the past and thats what im trying to do
6523913 just grow as a player for me im having more success but for me i dont change anything i just go out and try to be the same player im having better success than ive had in the past i cant pinpoint it as much as maybe just taking good swings at good pitches and just having better success with some pitches up in the zone maybe
6523914 our main goal is to make the playoffs whatever happens from here was in the past we just have to push for the next six weeks to get that playoff spot
6523915 i dont care about that kind of stuff i just go out and play winning a world series is better than winning an mvp thats just me personally i think winning the world series is way better than winning an mvp if you win an mvp you had a great year but an all around great year is to win a world series
6523916 hes been fun to watch hopefully it continues hes been the biggest part of our offense all season long thats great hes getting two three hits a game driving in runs hitting home runs hes been outstanding
6523917 he was hurt he was banged up in 06 and 07 i think mentally he knows how to handle a major league season now hes always going to be emotional after an at bat but its not like he was i think he kind of wore himself down a little bit i dont see him doing that right now
6523918 all these fans want to say players are emotional theyre the most emotional fans in all of baseball i dont get it im still the same emotional guy coco crisp is the one who told me to stay the same way not to change i tried being less emotional it didnt work
6523919 theres all different kinds of players that perform at different levels and perform on a different basis and have a different routine every day
6523920 theres not one right way to do things thats what makes sports so great is you can do whatever you have to do what makes you a better player because if youre a better player your team will be better
6523921 thats our job were put in the role were in because they thought of us as players who could do the job and do it all year thats what we do dustin and i were going to be grinding it out every day theres going to be ups and downs were just going out there every day and trying to win ballgames and weve done a good job this year
6523922 our main goal is to make the playoffs whatever happens from here was in the past we just have to push for the next six weeks to get that playoff spot
6523923 i feel all right i dont have any pain really
6523924 ive still got the bloody nose and you can see swelling but beyond that i feel fine pain wise
6523925 i havent seen a replay but i dont think it hit my helmet some people thought maybe it grazed the helmet i dont know but it got me pretty good though
6523926 i squared to bunt and when he let go of it i just remember it riding up and in i tried to pull back and get out of the way i saw the ball and it was about a foot away i closed my eye and it hit me
6523927 zach obviously let me know it wasnt intentional and he was sorry and it was just one of those things
6523928 i appreciate the call he wasnt trying to hit me in that situation i know theres no harm behind it its just one of those things
6523929 hes a tough kid to take a shot like that
6523930 this face will heal as long as i can still see because thats my front eye when i hit
6523931 he said he wants to make sure hes got one on his phone
6523932 were lowering our third quarter 2008 estimates to reflect the difficult operating environment characterized by lower client related trading volumes and losses on hard to sell assets primarily mortgage securities
6523933 the markets have not yet indicated that the credit and mortgage markets are getting healthier
6523934 we expect third quarter 2008 results will be hampered by declining global equity markets further deterioration in mortgage assets and slower levels of corporate and institutional activity we assume no or negative earnings for the majority of firms in our universe this quarter

6523941 ten of the 14 were alive when i started writing the book one of them passed away ive met every single one of them thats still alive and some of the other players widows
6523942 they listened on the radio to a spanish rebroadcast of brooklyn dodgers games
6523943 i dont give up on anything until were completely mathematically eliminated
6523944 so im not saying im giving up on the season but i am saying this is a good time for me like an extended spring training type of deal where i can go out there and im concentrating im making a conscious effort to better myself in this last part of the year so that i will be ready to go for next year
6523945 he leads to pitching coach chuck hernandez i think hes conscientious i think he wants to do all the right things i think that you have to go slow
6523946 once you get out of the catching spot you dont ever lose that
6523947 because youre just sitting there the whole time youre just reading batters more than anything
6523948 its more personal youre in it youre actually the guy doing it youre not sitting back watching
6523949 id say probably 70 75 percent of my focus has been to make sure the pitchers are doing what they want to do theyre comfortable calling the game
6523950 offense i know it will come but right now i think getting back in this position and kind of feeling things out from a defensive standpoint is probably more important than getting my offense going it will come around its just that its going to be a process its getting better now
6523951 contrary to what people think you go into the game having a game plan but sometimes you have to make adjustments on the fly to see what a hitters doing
6523952 and i dont think its fair to be asking him to do all those things just yet but theres no question he gets an a for effort hes working with chuck trying to learn the pitchers and i give him a whole lot of credit and i think by the start of next season hell be fine
6523953 hes going to throw good hes going to catch good hes quick back there
6523954 i think the no 1 thing he has to do is be able to retain his concentration pitch to pitch if he does that i think hell be fine hes got good quickness with a great arm

6523975 i cant deny war stories are my favorite genre and i do get a huge kick out of writing them probably because even now my opportunities to do so are few and far between
6523976 i do them whenever i can but in the last ten years youre talking about the two war story series which battlefields is a pretty direct thematic sequel too by the way battler britton and enemy ace so when i do get the chance to write them i give them everything ive got as far as im concerned battlefields represents my absolute a game right now
6523977 theres nothing unique about it really its the way i write everything the first third of this year more or less went boys punisher crossed streets of glory dan dare each month repeating every five weeks until each story was replaced by another
6523978 so im pretty comfortable switching from story to story with battlefields its given me a pleasant couple of months where ive spent 60 80 of my time writing war stories immersed in the lore and technical details of ww2
6523979 its also nice seeing his attention to detail with characters watching the people ive written come alive theres anna theres zoya thatll be kurt theres kosher and gloomy that must be scholz yes hes really caught the bastard ah and theres aleks so thats what he looks like russ has a slightly understated unfussy style that allows him to concentrate on storytelling in all its aspects to focus on narrative in a way that fewer and fewer artists seem to its something he shares with both peter snejbjerg and carlos ezquerra i believe a dedication to story that relies on substance rather than flash
6523980 i try and set the situation up as quickly as possible heres where we are and how we got there and then dive into the story introduce the characters get things moving
6523981 if nothing else the stories in battlefields highlight the courage of people whose time has almost passed and whose stories are fading the night witches for instance young women in their teens and early twenties flying obsolete biplanes at night against the most lethal military machine in the world facing potentially catastrophic consequences should they be captured alive or the tankies men going into battle against heavy odds knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt that the enemy has them outmatched and outgunned on every level but doing it anyway that to me is heroism and that deserves to be acknowledged

6524008 we need to know on what conditions the companies have reached an agreement whether they are exclusive but it is not such a trigger for the company which will radically influence its results

6524014 the bottom line is that airgun noise from seismic surveys that are thousands of yards distant does not drive away sperm whales living in the gulf
6524015 however some individual whales feeding at depth reduced the rate at which they searched acoustically for their prey when scientists carried out controlled exposure experiments by bringing seismic surveys close by the whales as a result the oil and gas industry has agreed to a best practice attitude that seismic surveys should shut down temporarily when towed airguns come within one third of a mile of whales or groups of whales in the gulf
6524016 sperm whales go to where their food source is and that means very deep water so folks that do see them are marine mammal observers who ride the seismic survey vessels and the workers on the big oil and gas rigs and even that does not happen often
6524017 we now know that the sperm whales in the gulf appear to be their own distinct stock they show genetic and social differences from other sperm whales around the world
6524018 there are believed to be about 500 to 1 500 sperm whales that reside in the gulf
6524019 the five year study has greatly contributed to our knowledge of sperm whales especially those found in the gulf of mexico its also raised new questions we need to know more about such as their feeding and breeding patterns theres still a lot we dont know about these huge creatures

6524021 in reaching the decision the commission was trying to move xcel energy toward carbon reduction goals that gov bill ritter has outlined in his climate action plan
6524022 also they were adding renewable energy resources in a cost effective technically feasible manner ensuring an adequate supply of electricity in the future and being respectful of the cost that consumers have to bear
6524023 we are pleased that the commission has agreed with our proposal to close two of our power plants as we continually move toward reducing our carbon dioxide emissions in colorado
6524024 gov ritter last year called for a 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emission by 2020 these closures will reduce our emissions by 1 4 million tons a year and put us well on the way toward meeting the governors goal
6524025 the colorado public utilities commission has set a clear path for colorados energy future
6524026 colorado will be a leader in clean renewable energy and well close down coal fired power plants and replace that energy with renewable resources
6524027 we need to look at renewable resources first and we need to get off of expensive and environmentally costly fossil fuel resources solar is a better investment today and will be a better investment for tomorrow to supply energy for colorado
6524028 at the moment we do not view wind as a viable baseload resource
6524029 i think all sectors of this industry need to pull their share and while there are reasons that exact solutions may be different in rural areas and for small utilities thats just a matter of degree

6524310 you hear so many people moaning about how the real estate market is crashing and the housing bubble is bursting but weve said all along that after the huge boom of the early 2000s there was bound to be a leveling out agents and consumers became so used to an abnormally great market that when it starts to normalize again they panic
6524311 our sales and customer support department have had their work cut out for them trying to keep agents from giving into the panic of the supposed market crash but they never gave up and its because of our amazing team of employees that weve been able to achieve this kind of success
6524312 its just amazing to be recognized for growing a business were so passionate about we knew going into this that if we put our minds to it wed be successful in a big way and the fact that weve grown so much justifies what weve believed all along theres still plenty of money to be made in real estate agents just have to be willing to work hard for it

6524316 many unstable countries change their currency every few years to help control runaway inflation and often to curb corruption the african country ghana just looped off three zeros in their currency this was done more to help control the rampant illegal diamond business in that country than to help inflation there was an estimated 25 percent of the currency in criminal hands outside the countrys banking system the turn in period was short only 60 days and the customer turning in old currency had to have an existing bank account
6524317 when the ruble became an international currency the first thing the russian government did was print new currency and give only 90 days to turn in old currency to convert to new currency
6524318 they also put a temporary freeze on new bank accounts being opened during the turn in period this left all the tens of millions of rubles outside russia as worthless a successful investor made several thousand percent in just the first year
6524319 today investors are interested in the chinese yuan the vietnamese dong and the iraqi dinar to name a few
6524320 the lesson learned is to make sure you comply with the issuing countries laws on their currency and business
6524321 to safely invest in any of these countries you need a state approved business license
6524322 because we do licensing in iraq we do make it easier to do business there where licensing has gone up dramatically for foreign companies often times it is better to wait until the currency actually makes it to the international market before investing or doing business

6524349 smaller than a pack of cigarettes the fs 488 quickly and accurately shows a car dealer if there is previous body damage on the car he is appraising or purchasing
6524350 in todays economy if a car dealer purchases or trades for a vehicle with previous damage he doesnt know about he can easily lose several thousands of dollars
6524351 we take the guess work out of determining a vehicles condition and help the dealer avoid serious losses
6524352 it was orange fairly large and heavy and the user said he paid over 700 for it i immediately saw the potential for the gauge and knew if someone could make a quality paint meter that was smaller lighter and more affordable it would sell like crazy
6524353 we have just scratched the surface of the automobile business we are also making huge inroads into the powder coating industry with our fs 502

6524358 everyone who sees the popatot at the beach and the kids soccer and tee ball games wants to know where we got it nobody has seen an entertainment center like this
6524359 i made the first one in my garage just for personal use with our children but the response from other parents prompted us to file for a patent and create a new product for families on the go
6524360 for the last year evan and i have been designing and building the prototype creating a company looking for financing and a manufacturer in addition to raising our 5 kids
6524361 popatot was born while camping with the family last year stacy and i found it difficult to keep the baby in a safe place while we setup camp cooked over the fire and watched the other four kids
6524362 so while sitting around the fire late one night we developed the concept on a paper sack almost unbelievably it will be delivered around labor day
6524363 its safe for my children and so simple to use
6524364 no more lugging multiple play sets and toys we just grab the popatot with the toys already in place and off we go its perfect when i go to my moms house
6524365 traveling is stressful enough these days but young kids and first time fliers are even more vulnerable to the anxiety associated with new sounds processes and unfamiliar faces associated with flying our goal is to help prepare children so parents dont have to appease them along the way
6524366 chipper is a character kids can relate to so we utilize the stories and activities to playfully teach kids good behavior in a variety of experiences
6524367 chippers plush pillow backpack is our answer to mom carrying the pillow stuffed animal and stuffed backpack
6524368 its lightweight soft and features ties with safety snaps so its three items in one that mom or dad wont have to carry because it rests comfortably on a childs back from check in to naptime and landing
6524369 we were scrambling to find something that would get this virus out of our network
6524370 we tried everything we could think of but nothing was working and time was running out
6524371 obviously after avgs free product performed so well i owed it to the company to check out avgs commercial offerings
6524372 weve just renewed our subscriptions to avg for the fifth time
6524373 this time we decided to work with an authorized avg distributor to help the purchase and installation process go as smoothly as possible we selected walling data who ive since learned is the largest avg distributor in the country because they were offering free round the clock support as part of their already competitive license prices
6524374 we havent had any issues with avg that have required us to contact walling for support but it is reassuring to know they are there if we ever do need them it also helps that there would be no surprise charges for support if we did have a problem
6524375 we were and always will be more concerned with finding a product that we can have confidence in something that wont allow viruses to take over our network we lost our confidence in mcafee but we found it again with avg
6524376 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6524377 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6524378 n o perceberam que ele estava fazendo uma revolu o no pa s
6524379 for sure last year kimi raikkonen was 17 points behind with two races to go and he won the championship so we cannot give up
6524380 i think we are there we are competitive so thats the only thing i want
6524381 sometimes we rely a lot on the car and on that occasion it was not possible because we had a failure
6524382 but it doesnt change our way of working because we still have seven races in front of us
6524383 it was not nice for sure it was very sad for me to leave the race with so few laps to go
6524384 but now im looking forward and trying to do a nice performance until the end of the season because we still have 70 points up for grabs and 70 points is more than the leader has now
6524385 so it can be that we still have half the season in front of us in terms of points
6524386 i think it will be very competitive in most of the remaining races
6524387 we have two new circuits in front of us where we dont know who will be quickest
6524388 i think we can be very strong at spa and maybe in japan for sure they mclaren can be strong in monza like last year we can be strong in brazil
6524389 we just need to see what happened last year and then maybe have an idea but things can be different than what happened last year
6524390 we need to try to win races for sure but if we dont win the race maybe we can finish in front of lewis or whatever
6524391 i think they have done a fantastic job in building the place up
6524392 it has got a great hotel and the track looks incredible
6524393 i think it looks pretty awesome so i am looking forward to getting out on it tomorrow
6524394 i think it is a pretty different track than we are used to having on the calendar
6524395 you can have maybe some corners which seem to be like monaco but some very different corners very long straights which even can be similar to bahrain for example
6524396 it will be very very dirty tomorrow because you can see that the asphalt is very very slippery and dirty but i think it will be okay
6524397 the circuit looks good but obviously we need to wait until we get into the rhythm of the weekend to understand what kind or what type of circuit it is as we dont know much about it
6524398 but it looks pretty good very well organised and obviously the atmosphere seems great because we are in spain and for sure we will have a lot of spanish supporters
6524399 its very similar to melbourne in a way because you have limited space on a road circuit i think its nicely done
6524400 obviously if you have problems in turns nine and 10 which is the bridge if a car parked there i think you would have to stop the race because its not even a safety car issue
6524401 you would have to take the car away and bring trucks onto the bridge
6524402 it might be a bit of an issue but i think we have to really understand what is the speed of the cars and the only corner that we were concerned about as a team was turn one because you dont have a lot of run off in that turn
6524403 it will definitely change the weekend for me because its a tragedy
6524404 all the spanish people are in shock and i am too
6524405 its probably the saddest approach to a weekend i have had
6524406 i will wear a black armband and i will talk with the other drivers tomorrow
6524407 maybe we can do something before starting maybe one minutes silence in the pit lane
6524408 tomorrow we will start slowly to get into the weekend life continues but its a different weekend compared to what it should be
6524409 yes for me i would definitely be looking forward to doing that
6524410 i just want to send out my heartfelt thoughts and best wishes to all the families and to all the people in spain
6524411 i think its a tragedy i was really sad to hear it had happened
6524412 i just hope that doesnt stall our weekend i hope we are able to move on and do the country proud
6524413 i think last year we had a similar accident in brazil and it was a disaster it was so sad
6524414 as lewis said i give 100 percent support to the people because we are here for sport and there are so many important things apart from sport which are the lives of these people and its a very sad moment
6524415 i think all of us need to do everything we can to help these people
6524416 with my presentation competing on web analytics i am working to clarify the steps companies of all sizes need to take to truly benefit from their investment in web analytics drawing on the wisdom provided by tom davenport and jeanne harris in their book competing on analytics focusing on how the enterprise can transform their data assets into a sustainable strategic advantage my presentation draws on my decade of work in the field and interaction with hundreds of companies around the world i believe that any company focused on making the most of their use of technology like omniture webtrends coremetrics unica and indextools will benefit from this presentation i am also honored to be presenting this work to an esteemed audience of my peers as imc has invited great web analysts like jason burby gary angel and bob page

6524435 have to agree with you and internet revies you are spot on we live in a critical culture where people feel like they are experts just because they can post a review bayou is great try their brunch and all of these fair weather bon vivant wannabes are just unable to be satisfied
6524436 his will be a nice spot to spend with my kinds this labor day weekend
6524437 the point is internet reviews are just opinions of people you dont know most people only bother to write when they are displeased so the reviews are usually negatively biased personally id rather ask people i know who have the same standards i have and not trust random online reviewers

6524443 kids definitely spend more time online during the summer months
6524444 but very often parents will try to curtail that time now with school back in the picture kids have the excuse they need to legally be online and surfing the internet
6524445 instead of doing research for a report they may be updating their facebook pages
6524446 there is no doubt that kids keep in constant touch over the internet throughout the summer
6524447 but they may find themselves becoming friends with classmates they werent friends with before or perhaps befriending the new student at school add to that the joining of special clubs or sports and there is a definite chance of new friends popping up on your childs social network page and im buddy lists
6524448 make sure you set up a schedule for computer time and rules for proper usage
6524449 if they are supposed to be doing schoolwork make sure they are doing school work and explain to them why its important to focus on the task at hand

6524511 the pairs relationship makes for wonderfully impish comedy and after only three quarters of an hour its hard to accept the end of the affair
6524512 we took a lot of time to fully understand the needs of our customers and quickly realized that we would have to offer the most robust solution possible the asigra application has advanced compression and de duplication features that significantly reduces the amount of data to be sent across the wire which reduces bandwidth degradation and saves our customers money on the storage costs the application also works on multiple operating systems and configurations so that we can backup and restore almost any server and desktop that our customers have deployed in their environment no matter where they are in the world we believe our customers will appreciate and see tremendous benefits to this solution for the storage of their critical information
6524513 we believe that this sizable investment in hardware software technology and processes clearly demonstrates a strong commitment to the marketplace to provide the most robust online backup and recovery solution possible furthermore since the amount of data organizations create and need to maintain is growing exponentially each year a solution that is dependable easy to use and implement and competitively priced will be very favorably received

6524516 but basic questions over the business case for nfc remain and there are sharp differences of opinion on how the market will develop
6524517 in many ways nfc shares similarities with the early days of the smart card industry particularly with the electronic purse
6524518 everyone thought cash would be redundant by now and wed all be using electronic money instead
6524519 but the business issues were very complex and in the end consumer demand wasnt strong enough to overcome the commercial barriers
6524520 with nfc though it is different consumers love using nfc and its that consumer demand that is set to drive adoption forward as service providers see the opportunity to use nfc as a competitive differentiator
6524521 i coached high school sports and when you have in place talent and teamwork it normally leads to success that defines what is unfolding in life with the help of my long time partner jerret goodale
6524522 both ryan and myself truly would be considered self made success stories
6524523 as i was raised by a single mother who inspired me early in life and made me understand that hard work and honesty are the keystones to creating a successful life path i had full time jobs starting at age 15 and thru the guidance of my grandfather i learned early to handle my money with care thru investments my life changed when i began attending life empowerment training and truly embraced the entrepreneur spirit thru an associate i was introduced to her husband ryan tolley there was an instant bonding experience that led to working as a team after refining our leadership techniques through the teachings of a great mentor who had owned companies in china mexico and africa we decided it was time to take our skills and leadership capabilities and form a business model where we could create success for everyone we touched from the feedback of our recent rollout i am proud to say that that goal has been achieved with flying colors

6524527 we build our business models around the same concept used to create championship sports teams talent coaching and top line management that work together for a common goal
6524528 ryan and myself are looking for entrepreneurs that want an opportunity to partner with a proven support team and a revolutionary company in order to create a long term business relationship based on a common vision our management team is top notch and our funding is what other startup business ventures dream about
6524529 opportunities are not lost they are taken by someone else
6524530 yourwebrep com does a great deal of work in conjunction with ad site its parent company but maintains its own independent client base as well
6524531 yourwebrep coms value stands on its own merit but we firmly believe that when teamed up with core services our clients marketing potential increases exponentially
6524532 our clients feel taken care of because we will go that extra mile so to speak each and every time for them it is no different with ywr we are not the first company to offer video spokespersons we do however offer the same features as these other companies for substantially less and in may cases even a fraction of the cost equally important our clients know that we will go that extra mile try something that has not been done before to ensure that they are getting the greatest return on their investment
6524533 we were thrilled to be recognized as a technical pioneer during our first year in the intimate apparel industry
6524534 it was an honor to see the slimpressions brand in the same category with such well known and seasoned brands and designers
6524535 having just brought our line to market in january of this year we were excited to see one of our shaping garments for the arms back and midriff on a runway model during the cila fashion show
6524536 having our industry peers recognize this innovation further validates that our products are a unique solution in the market
6524537 the success of shows like how to look good naked reaffirms that shapewear has to accommodate women of all shapes and sizes we are proud that slimpressions has been leading the way in smoothing and shaping women on the top half of their bodies and helping them feel better about themselves
6524538 in addressing true sustainability we had to look beyond the end product
6524539 our eco design strategy has a higher purpose that will help sustain our business and the earths limited resources and improve the lives of our employees and customers their families and communities
6524540 going forward we will partner exclusively with suppliers who share our vision of sustainability and are willing to work with us to streamline production and implement energy efficiencies
6524541 we want to keep packing materials to a minimum but need to ensure that each item arrives in tact so were also investigating alternative and sustainable packaging materials and methods
6524542 there really is a whole other world out there financially that most people dont realize exists right now
6524543 i developed these methods strictly for the average hard working american whos sick and tired of being overworked and unpaid and whos had enough of constantly battling to stay ahead of inflation tax increases and the rest of the bad news thrown at us everyday
6524544 this partnership factors strongly into our plans to expand our reach on a global basis and gives the spa week brand a distinct competitive edge
6524545 this will help to set us apart from our competition and serve to underscore our intent to continually offer our consumers new and exciting cutting edge content
6524546 this is only the beginning over the next several months we intend to unveil several exciting additions to our line up of programs and content offerings so stay tuned and enjoy the ride
6524547 we are naturally very pleased with the outcome on behalf of our client
6524548 employment law proceedings can be very long drawn out and expensive through arbitration our client had his case heard within a shorter time frame and at a lower cost
6524549 it is unfortunate uvdi chose to breach this contract and i greatly appreciate the efforts of michael morris and david krol of valensi rose
6524550 their professionalism dedication and commitment have been instrumental in bringing the facts to light
6524551 small business owners must document all of their expenses or they will not be able to take advantage of these tax benefits documentation is the only way to ensure they can maximize all of the available deductions the most effective method for keeping track of business related expenses is to record them in an accounting software program
6524552 lack of an organized documentation system is where many small business owners run into problems they dont think they have time to enter their expenses or to learn an accounting program or they dont want to spend the money to have someone enter the data for them
6524553 however the money they are able to save in taxes by capturing all of their data will be much more valuable than the time and expense of entering the data
6524554 keeping a record of business financial transactions is not optional says shwiff
6524555 the records a business keeps for the irs are the same records a business needs to prepare their financial statements so its not duplicate work
6524556 this economy is actually a window of opportunity for those savvy enough and bold enough to take advantage of the downturn
6524557 in harsh economies too many small business owners are quick to think of their own needs profit yet fail to ask how well they are serving their customers
6524558 now is the time to bring innovation and creativity to helping your businesss clients weather their own economic storms
6524559 too many entrepreneurs believe their real estate their patents their brand or their equipment are their businesses greatest assets when in truth their most dependable and leveragable asset is the loyalty creativity and productivity of their employees
6524560 the name change to telapprise from accucom builds on our already strong market position
6524561 our customers associate the telapprise brand with the most cost effective telecom expense management tem solutions available for over six years our brand has been synonymous with efficiency accuracy and value we will continue to develop solutions to better serve our customers and their increasing need to cut telecom expenses

6524563 we introduced ourselves to captain lu cho he was very friendly and graciously he gave us a tour of his jail
6524564 i tried to explain the concept of innocent until proven guilty but he didnt get it
6524565 the jail was very small and stark but very clean captain lu said it was a slow day two inmates were crowded in a space that the jailer said would hold 10 men they get rice some vegetables and water twice a day and occasionally some meat he could not tell us what kind of meat
6524566 when we drove by as far as the eye could see we could see a line of loaded cement trucks come in from one direction and leave empty from the other
6524567 because we cant concentrate on every region or profession although ive tried i offer a chance for domainers investors and website developers to pick up names at reasonable prices given the time and effort avoided in having us do the work ive always felt the value gain in a domain was generated by the holding period between when a domain is offered for sale and when its use can be developed or the right end user comes around our subscribers can add quality names to their inventory and still keeps their day jobs so to speak
6524568 ive really been able to pick up some great names due to jeffs work and appreciate the creativity and effort he puts in to finding the best names
6524569 jeff and i started a process to work together on future endeavors which led me to first add names to and then assume control over the geodomainlist newsletter our team is already extensively searching the daily drop free registrations and 10 15 expired names sites for top quality resale names and adding geo domains to our quest has increased our long term holdings substantially
6524570 our mission with the other dog show is to demonstrate that all our pets are winners in our hearts show dogs have their own type of event and now family dogs have one too
6524571 at telapprise we have always taken customer service very seriously listening to our customers about the telecom issues they face daily over the last year we conducted a series of informal research discussions and the results have strongly influenced the new website navigation and content
6524572 most companies are overwhelmed by the number of choices in purchasing and managing telecom equipment and services
6524573 given the importance of our website as a vehicle for two way communication with our customers it made sense to provide more resources and information to help them sort through their options
6524574 we are in a competitive market clients rightly expect strong solutions and professional service at telapprise we believe that our current products and services are the very best available but we will continue to listen to our customers to refine our products and services to meet their ongoing needs
6524575 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6524576 delay doesnt work as a tactic i want them to come in quickly and resolve this expeditiously
6524577 the main point is the timing of how quickly they offer the buybacks to investors
6524578 we want that done quickly and they had a voluntary time frame that was not acceptable
6524579 we are extremely disappointed with the decision made by myspace and fox interactive to delete our account
6524580 myspace was a great way for us to keep in touch with our pool playing friends and customers so the loss of franks myspace page is not an insignificant loss

6524583 we have long been excited about jazz and it is great fun to be a part of rolling out ibm rational team concert in such an innovative fashion
6524584 technology has improved to the point where remote training is not only feasible it is hands down the most efficient and effective way to let participants get their hands on a piece of software while interacting with a live instructor all from their desks

6524586 once completed the silver course will be a championship ready golf course
6524587 moving the course from a par 71 to a par 70 makes it more challenging from championship and professional tees while allowing an amateur friendly course from closer tees it will provide some of the most memorable holes at doral golf resort amp spa easily comparable to those on the blue monster golf course
6524588 working with the wetlands institute and building the excluder traps to help protect the diamondbacks has been a significant part of our audubon certification process
6524589 our entire staff is thrilled to be participating in this program and we hope it encourages our guests to do their part to save and protect the environment
6524590 again we are always pleased to see an improvement in the foreclosure situation even if it is just a month to month adjustment
6524591 although southern california was hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis the northern part of the state has also been significantly affected but not as much in san francisco even in san francisco though median home prices have declined
6524592 the region has seen prices fall approximately 20 to 25 percent since the middle of 2006
6524593 however median home prices and inventories in northern california have begun to level off in the past few months
6524594 jeff young is an enormous asset to the agilethought team

6524608 implementing a successful pci dss program that translates into long term roi benefits
6524609 the story is a long complicated one winding its way from china to france by way of the first world war the oil cartel the pharmaceutical cartel and iraq to its final destination a syringe full of something claiming to be a vaccine against the newly deadly avian flu
6524610 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering
6524611 as a physician i understand a basic virological fact that the public has not been told it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist public relations efforts to the contrary if a vaccine is being made against the avian flu virus in its pandemic form that means the pandemic virus must already exist so the fact that the avian flu vaccine is already being manufactured in china by sanofi pasteur reported to be a wholly owned subsidiary of total petroleum a french arm of the cartel supports our contention that the weaponized avian flu already exists as we saw in the case of the anthrax scare of 2001 an allegedly disgruntled government employee can release deadly toxins from even the most secure government facility
6524612 publicly available information shows the pharmaceutical industry and us government are both actively preparing for an avian flu pandemic this is shown through their own promotional literature and propaganda
6524613 the whole notion of an avian flu pandemic occurring without technological intervention is highly questionable to date there have only been around 385 human cases of avian flu identified worldwide assuming those identifications are trustworthy of course with 243 deaths to put the absurdity of this effort into perspective sudden cardiac death scd which many researchers believe is heavily associated with aspartame consumption is a leading cause of death according to the cdc for example scd killed 460 000 americans in 1999 and the numbers keep rising www cdc gov mmwr preview mmwrhtml mm5106a3 htm but aspartame a product of monsanto is an approved substance while the currently non pandemic avian flu is the focus of hugely expensive seemingly irrational preparations if there is no intent to create that very pandemic
6524614 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it drums into us is the
6524615 this show is perfectly timed for the fall holiday buying season and is the ultimate shopping solution for upscale pet industry buyers

6524629 we went across to a field as indicated by some information we had on the ground wed been over the field once but not seen anything
6524630 living abroad in various places around the world i came to realize that there arent a lot of social networks which connect people globally i wanted to build a social network geared towards inviting users from all over the world to join and meet each other

6524779 from the beginning we made the decision not to use artificial growth hormone in our milk production because we felt it was the right thing to do questions and concerns from consumers over the use of artificial growth hormone decisions in europe and canada to ban the substance and our concerns for the health of cows that willingly give us their milk every day all contributed to our decision to keep artificial growth hormone out of the production of our milk one of natures most perfect foods
6524780 we fought a good fight and this most recent decision by monsanto makes us as a company feel somewhat vindicated
6524781 id like to think that in some small part we played a role in that decision
6524782 we are strongly encouraging corporations that value their products and reputations to join forces with us in order to put those who steal your product out of business in jail or both hiring a former agent from the fbi or waiting for global law enforcement to help is a pipe dream with a serious global recession looming corporations cannot just sit by while someone else makes amp resells their product the epicenter of all of this is china and india
6524783 we had no idea how vast the problem is nor did we understand that virtually every legitimate corporate manufactured product is being counterfeited in china or india with the increasing probability of a severe global recession americas watchdog is urging corporations to utilize the very unique services offered by the global piracy amp counterfeiting consultants
6524784 the top ten global pharma companies are each losing billions of u s dollars a year to pharmaceutical counterfeiting the big tobacco companies are each losing billions of dollars per year to counterfeit cigarettes 200 billion of which are made in china auto parts manufacturers are losing billions a year sporting goods or entertainment companies are losing billions of dollars a year etc it has to stop and we have an integrated approach that will identify the counterfeit product retailers wholesalers and manufacturers there is nothing even close to our capabilities in the world
6524785 big pharmaceutical companies have done a pathetic job of protecting their brands and consumers are probably dying because of it
6524786 do not purchase any product on the internet unless you are 100 satisfied you are purchasing the authentic product amp it is produced by the legitimate manufacturer

6524805 the smart car has been an icon since it rolled off the assembly line in 1998 they appeal to all segments of the population and when the rally and photo shoot idea came up from our northern california chapter it truly felt like the perfect event for all smart owners to participate in and to really mark the first success point for the smart car here in the united states during this introductory year of the smart car to the us marketplace
6524806 with tremendous feedback and excitement around the smarts on lombard event smart car of america plans to continue the rally on an annual basis selecting different locations each year with the unbelievable turnout tripling early estimates its evident that the american public and auto enthusiast are opening their arms to the smart car in america and we plan to continue spreading the new found enjoyment around this great car

6524808 besides the obvious beauty and charm of huatulco i was impressed that it is the only resort community in mexico to obtain green globe 21 certification
6524809 it only takes a short time to get to know the locals because of their openness and gracious hospitality
6524810 the people of huatulco are dedicated to preserving their environment history and culture while also welcoming tourists to discover their rich natural resources and contribute to the economy
6524811 we decided a private residence club made the most sense for this unique piece of land along tangolunda bay
6524812 this is the last oceanfront property on the bay to be constructed and were only developing the minimum amount necessary to create an intimate resort experience residence club owners purchase a fraction of a home and they typically visit often while were keeping the overall density low owners will keep the tourism dollars flowing to help sustain huatulcos economy
6524813 residence clubs are a sensible way to own in any market but especially now members own deeded real estate in a prime location and prices reflect todays economy not only is the purchase price commensurate with the amount of use but the insurance taxes utilities maintenance replacement reserves and staff expenses are shared amongst owners the club is operated for the benefit and exclusive use of its owners similar to an equity golf country club
6524814 clients really appreciate the ability to capture all cash and benefits related expenditures in one report
6524815 the hr executive dashboard is great for reporting to upper management and indispensable for forecasting year over year increases
6524816 our internal research shows that 30 35 percent of employees will visit their online statement at least one time however when clients send at least three promotional messages employee utilization doubles
6524817 using our promotion module is a huge opportunity to maximize the investment in the project through higher utilization
6524818 the primary reason for off shoring is to save labor costs which in reality are a small component of the total manufacturing costs higher labor costs in the u s can be easily offset by lower inventory quicker customer response and higher quality
6524819 we have plans to expand to other markets and decided to launch in thailand first as we have local offices in thailand after our huge success with asiativ com as global brand we decided to use the asiativ brand for individual markets as well
6524820 i have seen the opportunities for the thai market as internet penetration is significant and the demand for offline payment channels is still important we therefore integrated with 7 11 and the atm system
6524821 the olympics are a special challenge for food producers because athletes demand organic food thats rich in vitamins and minerals and because the olympics food supply is strictly regulated by in country and international olympics committees
6524822 hydroponics allows strict quality control reliable supply environmental benefits and it produces high nutrition crops
6524823 australia wisely chose to rely on hydroponics for its 2000 olympics because soil grown crops could easily have been ruined by adverse weather which is not a problem with hydroponics
6524824 better yet as is the case in north america and europe hydroponics crops cost less to produce and buy than field crops
6524825 the chinese are mastering hydroponics rapidly especially as they produce fruits and vegetables for the 2008 olympics
6524826 in fact the chinese government created a highly regulated guarded organic greenhouse grown plant production infrastructure to guarantee the quantity and quality of the fruit and vegetable supply for olympic athletes and visitors
6524827 fact is organic fruits and vegetables grown hydroponically for the china olympics are packed with vitamins and minerals which means athletes perform better
6524828 and china is able to meet the demands for quality food better than if it was relying on regular soil agriculture healthy organic hydroponics food wins the gold medal at the 2008 china summer olympics in beijing

6524831 to live boldly encompasses many things an invitation to act true to your nature to act in accord with your natural strengths absent that it is the vision to begin to act in accord with your inclination seeking out that thing you would like to be or face even when the natural ability or the courage isnt yet within your grasp living boldly is walking right into the thing you need at the moment and putting it on seeing how well you can make it fit
6524832 live boldly before yourself so you live through your day to that just before sleep moment where you offer yourself the certain approval today i have done my best thats when you get to present yourself a trophy a trophy for living boldly forward in your day living as if no one were looking
6524833 unfortunately so many of those 47 blogging ebooks seem to leave you frustrated and disappointed so when i was planning the ballistic blogging range i thought lets take on the opposition with a free version
6524834 since those disappointing 47 blogging ebooks tell you how to start but then leave you high and dry i decided it was time for a new approach as blogging comes of age
6524835 instead the free ballistic blogging report is only the introduction to the system that looks set to redefine blogging for profit theres an interim 7 version that buyers can resell and keep all 7 but the main product is called the ballistic blogging toolkit this includes video tutorials to show you how a blueprint to follow to get started and then monthly updates of new blueprints help and advice
6524836 im really excited about the new dimension that ballistic blogging monthly will bring as it will provide new ideas advice and guidance each and every month so that ballistic blogging toolkit owners can repeat these techniques time and time again giving them free web traffic for life
6524837 as mccahon and i had quite a rapport between us i could ask him the sort of questions that helped him to explain his theories about art

6524854 sabrina walasek loved teaching middle school science and math in daly city and felton near santa cruz but after six years the oakland resident found herself worn out from keeping kids in check the amount of energy spent on discipline and behavior management just got to me after a while
6524855 according to a national center for education statistics nces survey of 8 400 public and private school teachers the main reasons for high teacher turnover and attrition rates are inadequate administrative support 38 percent and workplace conditions 32 percent

6524992 yearns to help children learn watch them grow and make a meaningful difference in the world
6524993 i love my subject but i know its not socially acceptable to say that in school i can be as enthusiastic as i want to be im able to convey that enthusiasm to the students to allow them to become confident and creative in their approach to the subject
6524994 relationships with students rewards instructional focus collegiality feeling needed and a desire to help others challenges and parents
6524995 life is learning and to be part of people developing and acquiring knowledge every person is unique and the challenge is to find fun ways to guide individuals to learn and understand what they are interested in learning
6524996 i love to see them growing personally socially and academically
6524997 they are rewarded more by witnessing their students succeed and follow their dreams than by any plaque
6524998 student achievement was another reward the teachers discussed as a reason for staying when their students were successful the teachers felt incredibly rewarded
6524999 they teach for the love of children and to contribute to the well being of all of us
6525000 teacher quality a report on the preparation and qualifications of public school teachers
6525001 hes showing he can do it now hurdle said of smith whos making his second career start in center field
6525002 ohhh hes british right is that the guy who does mr bean
6525003 i wouldnt like to launch myself as the guy who just does funny characters he says the phone from los angeles during a press junket for
6525004 i want to do funny interesting films play funny interesting roles and work with funny interesting people
6525005 hamlet 2 he portrays a director of a very different sort
6525006 i wanted to do something that was just a broadly funny movie says coogan who had been scratching around for such an opportunity for several years before landing
6525007 something that was laugh out loud funny but not brainless and those are hard to find
6525008 ive got plenty that i can do in the u k so im not hostage to having to work here all the time or just do stuff that comes along he explains im lucky in that i can be a bit more picky
6525009 somebody who had spent a lot of time in california coogan says somebody who had read a lot of self help books
6525010 otherwise he explains if youre seen as just very very british then it kind of defines you and you only get offered the parts of villains and peoples butlers
6525011 so theyre both sort of important to me he says i think being funny by itself is not enough for me but the idea of not being involved in comedy is also something i hate to think of i love to do things that make people laugh
6525012 theres an austerity to british comedy more than american comedy he says
6525013 its often about failure and i think american comedy ultimately has to be tied into some sort of success
6525014 but i also think theres more in common than there is different he adds

6525107 you might be wondering why we need this here at a veterinary school rather than a medical school
6525108 in the last 20 years if you look at the infectious diseases that have emerged most of them are zoonotic they have crossed over into humans from animals
6525109 if you examine the air that comes out of the building its actually cleaner than it is coming through the door
6525110 its a very unique opportunity for a private university to provide revenue for the town on what is now untaxed space
6525111 i think it also might be important to differentiate between the biosafety levels 1 4 and select agents the biosafety level refers to the precautions a researcher is recommended to undertake vis vis the potential risk the agent theyre investigating poses heres a great explanation of the biosafety levels from the cdc http www cdc gov od ohs biosfty bmbl4 bmbl4s3 htm select agents on the other hand are pathogens that the federal government has determined are the most worthy of understanding to prevent a bioterrorist attack so things like botulinum or anthrax which are categorized as bsl 2 are considered select agents and as such strict handling custody and containment protocols must be employed in facilities where theyre studied as far as the anthrax goes its usually studied with bsl 3 precautions not because of the potential for abuse but because anthrax spores are so difficult to kill we currently do not study anthrax

6525114 it depends on the time of year whether its flu season time for seasonal allergies or with our younger population time for physicals

6525116 the other things that people ask for all the time and that we dont do are pain medications especially for migraines

6525119 if you dont have a medical home we try to direct you toward one
6525120 the polyketal microparticles we developed are simply a vehicle to get the drugs inside the body to the diseased area as quickly as possible
6525121 the major advantage to using these polyketals to deliver drugs is that they degrade into biocompatible compounds that dont accumulate in a patients tissue or cause additional inflammation
6525122 we think these microparticles are going to be fantastic for oral drug delivery because they can survive the stomach conditions before they release their contents in the intestines
6525123 patients with acute liver failure need drugs as soon as possible or else theyll die
6525124 weve tailored the polyketals hydrolysis rates to deliver the drug in one or two days
6525125 delivering proteins inside microparticles has been limited because getting the protein into the microparticles required organic solvents that frequently destroyed the proteins
6525126 to overcome this problem we developed a method of simply immobilizing the protein on the surface of the microparticles
6525127 in the past few years we have developed methods to tailor the polyketals properties which have already allowed us to target many different medical conditions but our end goal is to test these treatments in humans
6525128 americas future depends on the health of our country the obesity epidemic is lowering our productivity and dramatically increasing our health care costs our analysis shows that were not treating the obesity epidemic with the urgency it deserves
6525129 even though communities have started taking action considering the scope of the problem the countrys response has been severely limited for significant change to happen combating obesity must become a national priority
6525130 despite widespread acknowledgement that obesity is endangering the health of millions of americans the country is still failing to respond clearly or comprehensively
6525131 we must work together governments schools and communities to improve nutrition and increase physical activity for all ages we must ensure that strong policies are implemented and enforced in every state not only to help reverse existing obesity rates but to prevent obesity among our nations children and generations to come
6525132 the report shows the serious impact that the obesity crisis is having on our countrys health and economic well being
6525133 we need to continue to work to create a real push towards reversing the obesity epidemic it is time we make it a national priority
6525134 any barrier or potential barrier including any technical siting financing or regulatory barrier
6525135 we dont really know how these drugs work but we think its got something to do with serotonin imbalance
6525136 ive heard you give this speech so many times ill bet i could give it for you
6525137 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6525138 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6525139 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6525140 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6525141 the caring voice on the other end of the line to people in distress
6525142 senator obama has wasted millions of dollars on a bizarre little odyssey of self aggrandizement funding that could have been better spent on the needs of american citizens
6525143 bashing a republican for having money is like criticizing a cat for having fur
6525144 that doesnt mean that i know everything ive got to have good smart advisers around me its not like i just kind of show up you know one day in the
6525145 we will have the best and brightest and by the way they dont have to be democrats
6525146 there are republicans like the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee who is one of my dearest friends and advisers in the senate
6525147 hes a staunch republican but chuck and i agree almost on every item of foreign policy
6525148 when i come down the street on game days ive noticed that frequently there are cars parked on the sidewalk and also parked next to the fire hydrant on the sidewalk sometimes blocking it on both sides
6525149 if theres a fire with a lot of cars parked by the hydrant like that particularly when theyre parking on both sides it would slow down the firemen
6525150 they block the sidewalk in such a way that you cant even squeeze by at all
6525151 the sidewalks really are for people to walk on and not for parking
6525152 ive asked police ticketing cars in the area to come and take a look at it and theyre really indifferent to it

6525223 i think it would be a foolish mistake to bypass this opportunity

6525233 people dont realize how high demand is for fields around santa barbara

6525302 a motorist survey this year by the rubber manufacturers association found that 85 percent of american drivers do not properly check tire inflation pressure this is an alarming statistic since tires are the only part of a vehicle in contact with the road and a critical vehicle safety component
6525303 drivers across the u s can battle rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation
6525304 current statistics indicate that 82 million vehicles have under inflated tires which means more rubber is hitting the road and accordingly miles per gallon is lessened in fact tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas is wasted by u s drivers each year simply because theyre driving on under inflated tires

6525355 permitting people to register as designated friends with mutual benefits and obligations the friends would have the right and duty to make financial and medical decisions on each others behalf in case of incapacitation theyd have the same medical leave and testimonial privileges as spouses and if one died without a will the other would be entitled to a share of the estate

6525378 penso che sia un tracciato impressionante interessante e molto diverso rispetto agli altri in calendario ci sono curve in cui sembra di essere a monaco ma anche curve molto diverse rettilinei lunghissimi che somigliano a quelli del bahrain penso sia davvero bello sar molto sporco domani perch si vede chiaramente che lasfalto molto molto scivoloso ma poi il problema si risolver mi piace la citt e spero sia una bella gara per noi e anche per il pubblico
6525379 dobbiamo guardare avanti e dobbiamo pensare alle prossime sette gare sappiamo di avere ancora 70 punti davanti a noi e dobbiamo dare il massimo per raccoglierli sarebbe stato meraviglioso vincere lultima gara ma qualche volta lo sport cos la cosa pi importante che siamo davvero competitivi allhungaroring abbiamo mostrato grandi prestazioni sia sul piano della velocit che del passo
6525380 era un problema di fabbricazione del pezzo e non si poteva fare nulla non abbiamo mai avuto un guaio simile se non in quel momento particolare quindi non potevamo farci nulla
6525381 il campionato si decider sui punti persi pi che su quelli guadagnati questa stata la chiave fin dalla prima gara tutti quelli che lottano per il titolo hanno perso punti importanti ma ora non si pu pi sbagliare

6525386 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

6525397 het ziet er naar uit dat griekenland er alles aan doet opdat het geschil niet geregeld zou worden tijdens deze periode van onderhandelingen namelijk voor midden volgend jaar en de verkiezingen voor het europees parlement
6525398 both candidates are talking about energy high prices and global warming so its important to look past the rhetoric and see what is at the heart of their plans

6525403 the damage to the senior center caused by a members lawsuit is now irreversible
6525404 the damage to the center by current officers efforts to change the governance of the center is also irreversible
6525405 current officers do not have the experience or knowledge to run the center
6525406 ongoing actions of the lawsuit group have damaged the centers reputation with all of our funders and the public
6525407 qualified members of the public are unwilling to serve on the board due to the damage by the above
6525408 the controversy at the south county senior center in recent months is a clash between a 40 year old foundering boards dictatorial control and the memberships desire for a democratic form of center management
6525409 the question is should complete control of this organization remain in the hands of a founder and friends and associates or should it be managed by the membership through an election process
6525410 the mandate of the membership is for an elected board by a mandate of over 80 percent
6525411 currently the directors of this self perpetuating private non profit offer
6525412 the membership comprised of thinking adults wants a membership elected board allowing the center to grow and offer up to date services
6525413 the question for the city and county is will you fund a privately managed non profit with public funds
6525414 at the end of this year over 40 years of experience on the board will be leaving and the following year we will loose another 30 or more years of experience
6525415 there is no evidence the direction and leadership of the current officers are adequate to continue the center
6525416 it is our responsibility as board members to move forward for the best interests of the senior center operation of the center by the city can provide a secure future for the center and the citizens it serves the current path is destructive and will surely cause the center to fail
6525417 i will be preparing a motion for the next board meeting to initiate this process
6525418 the point of talking with the city is to find a way for the center to continue
6525419 at least until we have a chance to talk it through at a board meeting
6525420 i am your nightmare i am the shape in the dark

6525435 its pretty humbling isnt it for an old fisherman and surfer in queensland who now and then plays a bit of cricket
6525436 after careful consideration and having taken advice from several people who have been close to me throughout my career i have decided to retire from one day international cricket with immediate effect
6525437 this has been a difficult decision but i want to play at the highest level for as long as i can and believe that concentrating solely on test cricket is the best way forward for me during the next phase of what will hopefully be a long england career
6525438 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands odi squad after careful consideration
6525439 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6525440 i decided to retire from englands odi team for a number of reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family
6525441 now that my family is settled and my bowling is settled i feel i have something to offer englands odi side and am looking forward to playing a part in the series against south africa

6525453 i hope other youngsters who have gone through a similar journey will be inspired by what im doing
6525454 ill be able to compete in the squash and swimming events i cant wait
6525455 it is heartbreaking for me i have to walk past that plot of land everyday and it is soul destroying knowing that no legal action will be taken and the people that did this will get away with it
6525456 the house was not in the state that was made out at the time my mothers house was never dilapidated
6525457 i have received a bill from my solicitor for 1 392 for barristers fees but they have waived their own fees
6525458 some of that money is to pay for planning permission on the plot of land that was knocked down which to me is ridiculous
6525459 i was also told that because the plot of land is now more valuable than it was in 2002 i cannot take thomas armstrong to court which is annoying and upsetting they made an mistake but that does not make it right
6525460 i believe this now concludes matters in that there are no future steps that can be realistically and sensibly taken to resolve the original issue of the demolition of the house
6525461 we didnt want to get rid of the house and turned down money from home housing who wanted to knock it down their offer of 1 000 was insulting to us and we decided to keep the property

6525474 we are following up information that people have rung in with we are looking at similar offences in the area we are seeing a large number of males anyone who was about at the time
6525475 we are still sending out the message to women to be careful we have not yet identified the offender we are looking at quite a lot of people in our system and working through them
6525476 i think they are totally mad but thank goodness for that
6525477 to do it in nine days at 100 miles a day is fantastic
6525478 it was a good challenge waking up every day knowing that we had got 100 miles to do it was also brilliant for my training for the rallying

6525487 while it remained behind the coalition as the preferred party on these issues its disadvantage was small and many more voters saw no difference between the major parties
6525488 there were clearly many factors that contributed to the australian labor partys 2007 election success but one was the partys increasing credibility with voters on national security issues
6525489 clearly the rise in the numbers seeing the us as a threat is motivated less by the belief that the us harbours military ambitions towards australia and more by anti american sentiment fostered by disenchantment with the fta free trade agreement and opposition to the iraq war

6525511 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
6525512 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited
6525513 this report is a one stop shop document that can guide us toward ensuring that we get clean safe water to canadians wherever they choose to live
6525514 migliaia di persone morirono sulla croce secondo le fonti storiche il supplizio era per gli schiavi i prigionieri di guerra e i ribelli al dominio di roma tra questi ultimi il pi noto era ges mandato a morire nel 30 d c circa mai tuttavia avevamo trovato prova che la crocefissione avvenisse con luso di chiodi su piedi e mani come descritto dai vangeli
6525515 e possibile che la maggior parte delle crocefissioni avvenisse solo con luso della corda che il condannato con i piedi appoggiati a un tassello di legno e le mani legate ai polsi attraverso la croce morisse comunque di stenti in poche ore i chiodi si conficcavano quando il martirio doveva risultare pi doloroso in casi eccezionali
6525516 we found that the hairs came from sheep and cattle just the types of animals that herdsmen care for during their seasonal migrations
6525517 in this order and by this succession the ecclesiastical tradition from the apostles and the preaching of the truth have come down to us and this is most abundant proof that there is one and the same vivifying faith which has been preserved in the church from the apostles until now and handed in truth
6525518 many theologians i among them strongly endorse circumspection when it comes to the attempt to use one of the great mysteries of the faith the internal life of god in the trinity to shed light on some other doctrine some doctrines do require deployment of the doctrine of the trinity to understand them properly most notably christology soteriology and pneumatology but the question of gender seems to be one of those theological subjects not much improved by reference to the trinity as is evidenced by the fact that everyone seems to be able to selectively access this doctrine in the interest of contradictory understandings of gender in short i find this whole line of theological reasoning unhelpful to an investigation of gender there are lots of good arguments to consider on both sides but this isnt one of them

6525540 in quel caso non si tratta di cooperazione militare ma bisognerebbe chiedere a mosca cosa intendono fare la nota che ci stata inviata non specifica nulla
6525541 non posso immaginare in questo momento fino alla soluzione della situazione in georgia in quali circostanze sarebbe possibile una collaborazione militare con la russia
6525542 speriamo che un giorno saremo in grado di riprendere una normale collaborazione militare con i russi

6525547 we are advocates for proper sexual education which we agree begins at home we offer assistance to those who may not have access to health services millions take for granted like simple ob gyn services we want to reduce teen pregnancy stis and abortion rates
6525548 the services we provide are invaluable to the community regardless of rhetoric and without which would cause significant hardship to those that rely upon the organization and further strain taxpayers and hospitals

6525580 the sexism of our day the dominance of male over female comes in two inseparable forms one directed towards persons the other towards god both social sexism and theological sexism developed from a common source the fall of humankind as described in genesis 3 they both result in prejudice against women and they both distort our image of god
6525581 the church at worship powerfully shapes our understanding of god and every week at church services all over the world church leaders reinforce our male dominant image of god with religious fervour pastoral authority and incredible repetition they talk as if god is male

6525606 dari sekian kabupaten yang dimekarkan halbar lah yang pertama kali membangun gedung perkantoran pemerintahan dan mulai digunakan sejak tahun 2005
6525607 karena sebelumnya itu semuanya terfokus di kota ternate yang waktu itu menjadi pusat dari kabupaten maluku utara
6525608 selain lebih mudah dalam pelayanan pemerintahan otomatis dengan berkurangnya luas wilayah tentu lebih mudah dalam perencanaan pembangunan
6525609 yang lebih memperihatinkan lagi masalah ekonomi masyarakat ini hampir semua masyarakat petani di halbar masih menggunakan alat tradisional dalam bercocok tanam otomatis mempengaruhi pendapatan mereka sehari hari yang jauh dibawah upah rata rata
6525610 20 persen sudah mulai nampak buktinya jalan di pusat kota sudah mulai hotmix taman taman mulai dibangun tapi bagaimanapun juga ini kan daerah baru
6525611 contoh saja waktu masih kabupaten maluku utara hampir seluruh jalan jalan hancur dan rusak parah setelah pemekaranbaru akan mulai nampak pembangunanya
6525612 tetap ini berada pada galian c sama pada yang dulu kalau berbicara sektor pertanian kita keterbatasan infrastruktur

6525614 a massive e mail and internet campaign is under way aimed at derailing the nomination of barack obama and making hillary clinton the democratic partys standard bearer next week at the national convention in denver
6525615 i still think he has the potential to improve the 100 by quite a bit to get it to the same level he is running the 200
6525616 there is of course a very nice bonus available if you run a world record in zurich
6525617 i think zurich is probably the most advanced track there is in the world
6525618 it needs time to settle in so we expect the track to be in better condition for the athletes than last year
6525619 as per the arrangement customers who hold a credit card of any of these banks can avail iphone without any down payment and at a rate which will be significantly below the interest rates charged for credit cards or personal loans
6525620 the amount can be reimbursed in 6 to 12 months equated monthly installments emis
6525621 this could be similar to the credit facility that we are currently offering in the consumer finance space
6525622 in the us the operators are giving subsidies to increase the usage and the attraction is the price tag you need to have a price advantage while you market this in india
6525623 however you cannot compare india and the us as both are two different markets
6525624 here it will take time to test how the market will react to it we need to wait and watch up to what extend this could be received
6525625 the draft of the speis supplemental programmatic environmental impact statement on weapons complex transformation will be coming out very soon and were anticipating that well still be the preferred alternative for upf
6525626 its kind of a mixed bag do we need upf and if we need upf where is it but i think those things are reaching resolution with completion of the speis documentation the decision that tom dagostino nnsa administrator is working to make i feel encouraged were moving in the right direction obviously we cant say anything or dont know anything final until the speis comes out but that is going to be out in the late august or september timeframe
6525627 we feel like upf has to be built we fee like from our perpsective that y 12 will get that mission and that upf is the thing to do from a standpoint of having the capability and being cost effective in the future upf just makes sense
6525628 it will not be less expensive to build upf elsewhere
6525629 weve worked on teams that have looked at other potential sites savannah river and pantex are two sites that have been looked and and in great detail and frankly what the teams have done is theyve used basically the same construction costs for upf whether it be y 12 pantex or savannah river i think its a fallacy that upf could be built more cheaply somewhere else the other thing that goes with that is weve already built heumf at y 12 at a cost of about 550 million that would have to be built at another site because it would not be feasible to store highly enriched uranium here and do production work somewhere else it would be a transportation nightmare
6525630 the other thing is we talk about enriched uranium but y 12 does other functions that are part of our missions here those facilities would have to be built at another site also and i think thats going to play out in the long term analysis
6525631 i think actually theres some fairness in it what theyre looking for is there are eight sites in the complex and theyre trying to reduce the number of sites that have special nuclear material so what you do is you look at sites with special nuclear material and you ask is it possible to close one of those sites so i think it was a timely and responsible thing to look at that analysis and i think theyre finishing up that right now
6525632 you want to give em just enough to hook em
6525633 they were less christ centric and more aware of gods providence in their surroundings
6525634 the cowboy church works because we are people who like to ride and also worship the lord

6525692 i stopped drinking i got back in shape it took me two years but ive changed my life around
6525693 i think that the capacity to learn goes very deep with all people
6525694 learning is not just memorization but an attitude mindset set of skills if people learn how to learn at a young age theyll have the tools they need to educate themselves with curiosity as their guide throughout their entire life
6525695 most important to me is the rise of the diy spirit and the tools to help people create things

6525703 they know hes in heaven with jesus and they know they will see him again the pain of separation the pain and the grief of loss is very real
6525704 i had the privilege of baptizing him and confirming him in the christian faith
6525705 he did touch a lot of people he probably thought he didnt but he did
6525706 youd love to have him as your own such such a gentleman
6525707 kids today think about themselves first and foremost he was not like that hes got to be in the top 1 percent of kids today he was so focused and thoughtful
6525708 he said iraq is where he belonged and he knew where he was supposed to be
6525709 i believe it was deep in his faith in his being he knew this was something that was important
6525710 we know hes in a better place the sad part is not being around to see him grow up the sadness is seeing his mom and dad in their situation
6525711 you could see it come out in him the haircut the pushed back shoulders trim and tan

6525787 we are now working with important international commercial and correspondent banks on a daily basis including european asian and african ones
6525788 this economy has its own attractions even under the worst conditions
6525789 it will be troublesome if europe imposes unilateral sanctions on irans banks but we will be able to again replace the outgoing banks
6525790 domestic investment on its own cannot meet the countrys needs which makes iran an opportunity for foreign banks particularly as investment banks not retail banks to function as gates in attracting foreign investment

6525795 republicans are concerned on two fronts first the names involved republicans inside edge talked to are concerned the prominent names that could take a hit on the republican side could be even more devastating than what the democrats faced they are also concerned that timing could be a lot more damaging as the election draws closer voters start paying more attention while a september or later round of indictments could greatly benefit republican corbett in his reelection bid it could have a devastating effect on republican legislators because the focus would shift to them right when voters are really starting to tune in while any possible indictments are not known for sure republicans who agreed to talk to us are very concerned about the rumors they are hearing and are bracing for the worst
6525796 god whatever it takes make me a vessel of your truth

6525860 its so easy for somebody to say they will do something for 3 per cent when it should be 5 per cent and thats always attractive but the problem is if the property is worth 2 million and they get you 1 7 or 1 8 million the value is not in the commission its in the price negotiated were seeing it in all areas of our business everybodys trying to be a wal mart and thats not where it should be going and thats not where i go

6525885 whether i shall turn out to be the hero of my own life or whether that station will be held by anybody else these pages must show
6525886 the cider house rules i think represent those kind of rules that are imposed on us rules that are made by others who know very little about the circumstance of our world and therefore its important to oppose those rules and question them

6525899 the studio however wanted cruise to play the operative which the star deemed too close to mission impossible
6525900 i truly thought tom would be great in the role of an outsider elected to the highest office the studio was always more than happy with cruise for the original role but wanted to explore further possibilities for the president including denzel for them it was about finding the right balance between the two leads in a very high budget political thriller

6525930 we had dreams that computers would improve education and improve communication and help us achieve a lot of tasks a lot of us in our group understood it
6525931 what we were doing was not figuring out how build a computer it was how you get a computer that fits into the home price looks a lot of that stuff it gave us more passion we used the word revolution all over the place
6525932 i was doing really advanced computer designs when i was 10
6525933 i just loved computers and what they were and ones and zeros and the logic and how they added
6525934 sometimes when youre short of resources it forces you to do better work
6525935 i couldnt afford an online timeshare computer system i had to write down ones and zeros and simulate the computers operations it was all done by hand never once on a computer
6525936 some of the tricks were so weird i knew youd never find them in a book
6525937 i got a job a hewlett packard designing handheld calculators i was very lucky because i could design they interviewed and hired me but i didnt have a degree
6525938 i did go back to college i got my degree under a fake name rocky raccoon clark
6525939 i wanted my kids to see they had a dad who had a college degree i went back 10 years after i finished my third year

6525945 sometimes i go into an apple store and say im an employee i get a discount
6525946 these press guys who write stuff like that they get seated first in the prime seats
6525947 now were in the age of blogs opinions get replicated facts dont come into play much
6525948 i dont like any articles that put people down like steve jobs because it sells everybody likes to see heroes beat up
6525949 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make five million dollars and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6525950 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6525951 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6525952 when somebody makes that argument particularly given that i spent my entire life working with workers low income communities to try to make peoples lives a little bit better then thats when you know were in political silly season

6525959 writing from his perspective lets other people know how great of a dog he is
6525960 weve lost touch with our traditions and values our politics has become a poisonous swill and the most influential voice for the business community has been taken hostage by partisan ideologues
6525961 i want to send a wake up call to the citizens of wisconsin regarding our economy and our educational system
6525962 the ailing economy poses a serious threat to our schools and colleges and unless we act now to protect funding for education the states future will be bleak
6525963 the hyper partisan environment at the state capitol is toxic
6525964 the first priority seems to be to repudiate damage or block any proposal or position of the other party the second priority is to push their own partys proposals and positions in unaltered form the far distant third priority to be avoided if at all possible seems to be addressing any genuine state need that requires compromise
6525965 for the last 15 years of wisconsins declining fortunes the candidates wmc has supported for elective office have been the very ones who when elected have concentrated their efforts on opposing stem cell research and domestic partner benefits pushing a cleverly named but economically devastating taxpayer bill of rights fussing over the definition of marriage hauling universities before staged hearings to defend our efforts to prepare ethnic minority students for the workforce railing against the personal views of otherwise obscure instructors resisting any form of gun control proposing mandatory arming of teachers demanding the illegal summary firing of named state employees and proposing the elimination of the states only public law school
6525966 what do any of these ideological diversions have to do with making wisconsin the most competitive state in the nation
6525967 those are all things that rep nass has been critical of has challenged the uw on and raised questions about and numerous other scandals frankly theres probably two pages worth of issues
6525968 but john wiley wants to live in this very distorted world that everything he did was wonderful and he ran the university well
6525969 if theres any campus in the state that has no room to complain that they dont have resources its madison
6525970 have no time for the whining that john wiley became known for toward the end
6525971 truly astounding number of independent counties cities towns villages school districts and other jurisdictions
6525972 to the citizens of wisconsin unless we want wisconsin to become a permanent third world state we need to stop electing fanatically dedicated partisan ideologues of all stripes and start electing pragmatic problem solvers to wmc member companies please get control of your staff or replace them
6525973 its part tractors part family part reunion part meeting people

6525977 everyday that goes by without action another 18 veterans commit suicide and hundreds of thousands of veterans are denied mental health care and the compensation they need to survive at swords to plowshares we deal everyday with homeless and mentally ill veterans these veterans need medical care and disability compensation in the near term to prevent the outcomes we still see among our homeless vietnam era clients veterans are giving up committing suicide it is a tragedy
6525978 the courts ruling is very disappointing the decision lays out in great detail the failures of the va and yet the court will not act if the administration and congress were exercising proper oversight of the va then these veterans would not have had to resort to the courts the va benefits system should have out a welcome mat not a locked gate for desperate veterans to pound on to get in or die waiting for it to open
6525979 there are good people on the ground in va offices and vet centers providing care but the leadership made no provision to meet the wave of new combat veterans there is no consistency of care we get a steady stream of calls from iraq veterans and their families struggling without care and benefits the homelessness joblessness broken families and suicide are heartbreaking
6525980 we had hoped that the judge would call for some independent oversight of the vas mental health services to bring some consistency and accountability to the treatment of our veterans we hope for a different outcome in the plaintiffs appeal in the meantime veterans and their families wait suffer and die needlessly
6525981 theres a lot more under the water in this investigation
6525982 mr brodsky is seeing just a small snippet of whats out there
6525983 a lot more interviews and information that we havent seen or are privy to that is part of this investigation of stacy because drew peterson is still the prime suspect of this potential homicide of stacy peterson
6525984 we are pleased to launch the dfr 8320 ross 2ru high density 20 slot frame series at ibc 2008
6525985 the modular backplane allows the dfr 8320 to offer both a 10 bnc per module rear as well as a split 5 bnc per module rear for applications requiring high density 1 in by 4 out solutions the dfr 8320 supports any mix of analog digital video and audio modules in the same frame making it a great addition to the award winning opengear family
6525986 we have received positive feedback from our clients based on our ability to meet delivery commitments as a direct result of implementing the microsoft tool refining our processes and the evolution of our project management office

6525994 its that they may not consciously recognize the automatic associations that influence their decisions
6525995 the difference in reaction time was typically very small usually about 100 to 200 milliseconds
6525996 but these millisecond differences were informative enough for us to predict their future decisions
6525997 the lore in politics is that campaigns need to target undecided voters
6525998 but this research suggests that it may be much more effective to focus on your base by registering as many people as you can and getting them to vote on election day

6526006 for far too long the rules of the financial services industry have been tilted in the interests of companies and consultants not the millions of american workers who are deeply worried about saving enough for a secure retirement
6526007 with more and more workers having to dip into their nest eggs just to stay afloat in todays economy there is a clear and urgent need to ensure that workers are getting the best deals possible on their 401 k and other retirement plans
6526008 in its final months in office this administration has developed a disgraceful pattern of sneaking in last minute regulatory changes at the behest of special interests at a time when americans retirement accounts have already been pummeled by the nations economic downturn it is deeply extremely troubling that the department is trying to push through proposals that would further jeopardize workers hard earned savings indeed the rules proposed by the administration today are nothing less than a boon for wall street and corporate executives and i urge the department to immediately withdraw these harmful proposals

6526025 with respect to the riverfront park we are certainly pleased with the 1 6 million grant award
6526026 this funding continues a partnership with the state that we started a number of years ago when we first embarked on the riverfront park project these grant monies joined with town funding and funding from the community will help us move forward with phase two of this project

6526031 while it remained behind the coalition as the preferred party on these issues its disadvantage was small and many more voters saw no difference between the major parties
6526032 there were clearly many factors that contributed to the australian labor partys 2007 election success but one was the partys increasing credibility with voters on national security issues
6526033 clearly the rise in the numbers seeing the us as a threat is motivated less by the belief that the us harbours military ambitions towards australia and more by anti american sentiment fostered by disenchantment with the fta free trade agreement and opposition to the iraq war

6526058 there were clearly many factors that contributed to the australian labor partys 2007 election success but one was the partys increasing credibility with voters on national security issues
6526059 i spoke with some friends on the phone today they are large families living in russey keo in the same small block on road no 5 in phnom penh they all went to the polling stations and none were able to vote all of them have all their family members registered with the sangkat with their family books one family very pro srp despite the fact that the elderly father of the family is a driver for the cpp were not on the list at all the other family were on the list but someone had already voted under their names when they got there their friends on the other side of the no 5 road were not able to vote either they say but i have no details another friend who lives with his wife and two small children between norodom and monivong south of sihanouk he works at the s korean embassy told me his name was not on the list despite a prior visit to his block by officials checking electoral lists i have as yet not found any khmer person that i know in pp who was able to vote successfully

6526131 it feels like a more familiar role for all of us when were starting the season because we finally feel like we know our players as athletes and people weve worked with our seniors for the past two seasons and for everyone else they only know our staffs way of doing things i think were starting to feel much more connected with our players things are rolling for us and we dont have as much teaching to do
6526132 we just blocked out a lot of what we had to deal with last year it will be exciting to walk out there with our stadium being completely done and looking amazing weve really learned what the facility is all about from the surface the weather and playing under the lights having the stadium totally finished this year diminishes a ton of distractions which will only help us we have a lot of night games on the road as well and i think they are something our players get excited for
6526133 i think we took our schedule a notch up in terms of its strength if we have success with it we should be in good position for a tournament bid it is great that were playing the big 12 sec the big east and eight ncaa tournament teams from a year ago there are some new teams for us and we will have to work hard in preparation it will be a motivating factor for our players to play teams that are well known
6526134 it is rare in my career to feel so connected to a senior class since it is a small class we know each one of them well they are really close as a class and have embraced what we are trying to do it will be fun to watch them lead our team because they are excited to do it they will all have an impact on the field which isnt always true of a senior class it will be a special year to have that experience with the four kids
6526135 we are fortunate to have one more year of jeanette lorme in the midfield she will be the key to that unit she isnt flashy and she isnt one you will always notice but she does all the dirty work and keeps the ball for us she is usually the reason things happen from back there jennifer baumann will only be better from having a year under her belt and there will be a lot of competition to round out our midfield
6526136 leigh coming back is going to be exciting because she will add a dimension of athleticism that weve been lacking and we are ready to have her stability back there she is so hard to beat kay sampson all have experience back there we arent sure exactly what the backline will be but it will be experienced that is important because we will have young goalkeepers the experienced players will have to help lead in the back at the beginning of the season

6526168 campagna stragista continentale avente come obiettivo strategico anche quello di ottenere una revisione normativa che invertisse la tendenza delle scelte dello stato in tema di contrasto della criminalit mafiosa
6526169 le indagini svolte hanno consentito lacquisizione di risultati significativi solo in ordine allavere cosa nostra agito a seguito di inputs esterni a conferma di quanto gi valutato sul piano strettamente logico allavere i soggetti cio gli odierni indagati n d r di cui si tratta intrattenuto rapporti non meramente episodici con i soggetti criminali cui riferibile il programma stragista realizzato allessere tali rapporti compatibili con il fine perseguito dal progetto

6526173 alla verifica di corrispondenza tra il numero di iscrizione e i soggetti
6526174 si tratta di mera comunicazione orale da parte della segreteria previa autorizzazione
6526175 aspetti alquanto inquietanti specie in considerazione della commistione di probabili menzogne e marginali verit
6526176 risulta quanto meno provato che la morte di paolo borsellino non era stata voluta solo per finalit di vendetta e di cautela preventiva bens anche per esercitare cumulando i suoi effetti con quelli degli altri delitti eccellenti una forte pressione sulla compagine governativa che aveva attuato una linea politica di contrasto alla mafia pi intensa che nel passato ed indurre coloro che si fossero mostrati disponibili tra i possibili referenti a farsi avanti per trattare un mutamento di quella linea politica e proprio per agevolare la creazione di nuovi contatti politici occorreva eliminare persone che come borsellino avrebbe scoraggiato qualsiasi tentativo di approccio con cosa nostra
6526177 come una vite arrugginita che ci vuole del tempo per svitarla
6526178 io a cosa nostra ci ho creato un terremoto di decimo grado
6526179 hanno promesso allo z tot che devono rifare il processo nel quale lui stato condannato allergastolo
6526180 il discorso che ganci mi confid che salvatore riina si era incontrato con personaggi importanti proprio in relazione allattentato in danno del giudice falcone per ottenere in cambio una probabile revisione dei processi o altri favori come per esempio la non approvazione della legge sui pentiti o comunque di non rendere possibile una legislazione sfavorevole allorganizzazione di cosa nostra
6526181 ribadisco di non aver saputo da ganci raffaele n quando mi fece questa confidenza n in epoca successiva sino alla data della mia costituzione chi erano i personaggi importanti in contatto con riina
6526182 80 decise di indirizzare i propri voti verso alcuni candidati del psi anzich come tradizionalmente aveva fatto verso esponenti della dc
6526183 una cosa deve essere chiara che queste persone importanti non erano certo uomini di cosa nostra perch pi importanti di riina e provenzano non ce ne sono allinterno dellorganizzazione e quindi i personaggi con cui riina si incontrato li dovete cercare fuori dallorganizzazione
6526184 voglio che sia verbalizzato che probabile che io possa ricordare altri episodi specifici circa i contatti tra mangano e dellutri anche se in questo momento non mi vengono in mente non perch io non li voglia riferire ma perch si tratta di fatti molto vecchi che richiedono un grosso sforzo di memoria da parte mia
6526185 precis che secondo degli accordi stabiliti con dellutri che faceva da emissario per conto di berlusconi arrivavano a riina 200 milioni lanno in pi rate in quanto erano dislocate a palermo pi antenne
6526186 queste rate venivano consegnate non so da chi a pierino napoli reggente della famiglia di malaspina compresa nel mandamento la noce
6526187 da quello che sentivo dire da riina e da biondino si era certi che lo stato non avrebbe reagito i rapporti che loro facevano comprendere avere con altre persone erano tali da non far presumere reazioni forti
6526188 io mi sto giocando i denti possiamo dormire tranquilli ho dellutri e berlusconi nelle mani e questo un bene per tutta cosa nostra
6526189 un giorno ci siamo incontrati io riina ganci e credo biondino salvatore che venuto ci doveva dare alcuni punti di fare annullare lergastolo di fare annullare la legge sui pentiti il sequestro dei beni e altre cose diciamo ha parlato con me e con ganci
6526190 p m e queste richieste in quelloccasione disse a chi dovevano essere rivolte cancemi lui pi volte ha detto che aveva queste persone nelle mani quindi berlusconi e dellutri quindi queste cose lui le doveva girare a queste persone per me era una cosa p m s ma nel corso di questa in questa riunione riprese il discorso di chiarendo cancemi s lui in questa in questa riunione dice che ci doveva fare avere queste cose a queste persone berlusconi e dellutri i nomi che ha fatto erano questi qua anche dopo diciamo lui parlava sempre di queste persone anche dopo questincontro mi ricordo che altre un paio di volte ha parlato sempre di queste persone
6526191 mi ricordo una volta ha fatto un discorso che cercava di portare queste persone
6526192 io vi devo dire quello che mi risulta lui stato proprio in quel periodo che mi ha chiesto queste cose qua esatto
6526193 mi rispose cos totuccio stai tranquillo stai tranquillo stiamo a buon punto non pensare che io dimentico diciamo n carcerati n nessuno
6526194 queste persone noi li dobbiamo garantire ora e nel futuro di pi
6526195 si parlava quello sulla bocca era sempre martelli and la barbera come gli ho detto non cera bisogno pi di ritornare sul punto del dottor borsellino in quanto era stato menzionato cos molto veloce gi precedentemente fine febbraio inizi di marzo
6526196 io ho capito che il riina aveva premura come vi devo dire una cosa di una cosa veloce aveva io avevo intuito questo che il riina questa cosa la doveva la doveva fare al pi presto possibile come se lui aveva qualche impegno preso
6526197 io apprendo come fatto esecutivo la strage del dott borsellino tre giorni prima che succedesse da biondino salvatore e mi dice siamo sotto lavoro e poi quando apprendo dalla tv con siccome io non mi ero visto con salvatore riina quindi vuol dire che qualche cosa era successo cosa gli avevano detto cosa era successo non glielo so dire per c stata unaccelerazione
6526198 che lui ci diceva che erano quelli che un bene per cosa nostra
6526199 appare chiaramente smentita dal fatto che il collaborante prima ancora di confessare la sua partecipazione alla strage per cui processo aveva gi indicato delle circostanze che avrebbe dovuto tacere se questa fosse stata leffettiva motivazione del riserbo
6526200 una volta individuato il solo fattore inquinante della collaborazione del cancemi nella predetta volont di esagerata autoprotezione e cos spiegata lindubbia progressione accusatoria delle sue dichiarazioni ben possono le medesime essere utilizzate
6526201 conferma lattendibilit delle sue chiamate in correit nei confronti degli imputati per cui processo
6526202 80 il gruppo ferruzzi gardini era venuto in sicilia e aveva rilevato tutte le imprese di
6526203 nel momento che il signor berlusconi si veniva a lamentare nuatri putivami accuss videmu dagganciari craxi tramite berlusconi
6526204 rispondeva picche che non erano pi i tempi di una volta
6526205 esclusivamente di un progetto di eliminare tutta una serie di personaggi per quelli sul pentolone lima prima e falcone si parla di personaggi politici non politici amici o ex amici persone che si erano messe a disposizione e che avevano tradito perch noi dovevamo stroncare lattivit politica o la corrente politica di andreotti in sicilia in quanto lui non si era interessato per il maxi processo
6526206 non mi stato mai richiesto che ne pensi se vuoi uccidere il dottor borsellino o meno o cose varie non mi stato chiesto quindi io non che potevo dire un parere si o no
6526207 ma siccome non ho premura di farlo me lo faccio quando mi viene pi comodo
6526208 con sorpresa mi fa dice mi vogliono portare a bossi mi vogliono portare a bossi tanti avvocati
6526209 si sono fatti sotto gli ho fatto un papello cos
6526210 tutta una serie di benefici che si discuteva nel tempo
6526211 guardi io non era sicuro se era avvenuto prima la strage borsellino o dopo sono riuscito a potere mettere dei paletti con certezza a causa delle accuse che mi faceva il di matteo mario santo e quindi io siccome poi in quel periodo mi sono trasferito nel trapanese per commettere anche reati l ho potuto stabilire che era prima della strage di capaci quindi dopo la strage di capaci e prima di quella del dott borsellino sar stato una settimana prima saranno stati dieci giorni quindici giorni per nellarco di questo tempo prima sicuramente della strage del dottor borsellino
6526212 sono due cose completamente diverse e separate almeno per quello che riguarda noi anche se poi ho saputo che dietro le quinte chi gestiva alla fine era sempre uno da parte dello stato ma io non lo so io so bellini che per noi era tutta unaltra strada
6526213 cera lonorevole and che nei suoi comizi gridava per garantismo cio per una serie di fatti generali ma ne usufruiva cosa nostra e noi gli davamo questa interpretazione
6526214 il fine comune era di portare lo stato a trattare con cosa nostra
6526215 e nello stesso tempo loro per i fatti suoi io non so per quale motivo si volevano togliere qualche spina o qualche cosa dalla scarpa
6526216 persone o fatti che lo inducessero a pensare che nelle stragi del 1992 vi fossero implicate a livello di ideazione persone diverse da quelle che sono appartenenti a cosa nostra
6526217 siamo a mare cio mi abbracciava mi allargava le mani come a dire siamo a mare
6526218 so che ci sono indagini che lo riguardano dellutri n d r e che riguardano insieme mangano
6526219 limprenditore allinterno della fininvest aveva lappalto delle pulizie allinterno della fininvest
6526220 io glieli ho mandati a dire un po tutti assieme per nel tempo se non con la minaccia se non avrei continuato le stragi se loro non avrebbero fatto niente dice no no no e mi manda a dire tramite vittorio mangano cio di stare calmo piano piano che ora si va vedendo ma poi subito tutto fin l perch vittorio mangano poi viene arrestato io non avevo pi contatti il governo berlusconi subito dopo caduto quindi i contatti miei sono finiti qua
6526221 quando bagarella mi allarga le mani che non aveva pi nessuno cio per la strage al nord io convinto che lui avesse qualcheduno e mi diceva che non aveva nessuno e che giuseppe graviano laveva lasciato in mezzo a una strada o perlomeno si erano tirati indietro sempre a dire del bagarella al che io gli dico proviamo questa strada perch avevo letto su repubblica lespresso questa intervista o queste dichiarazioni credo che erano gi i primi attacchi politici nei confronti di silvio berlusconi cominciano a uscire indiscrezioni per dire silvio berlusconi aveva amici mafiosi cio questo era il senso per me di quelle di quelle notizie quindi io leggendo questo gli chiedo a vittorio mangano se era vero o non era vero e quello mi conferma tutto paro paro s vero allora dico sei in condizioni di ripristinare cio di riprendere unaltra volta i contatti con berlusconi dice s dice fammi vedere va a milano torna e mi porta la risposta che a disposizione cio c il contatto di potere riprendere con silvio berlusconi per non gli domando tramite chi
6526222 colpa del governo precedente perch i carabinieri le forze di polizia sapevano
6526223 attaccare il governo precedente che era un governo di sinistra anche se era un governo tecnico ma era un governo di sinistra e che se lui non sarebbe venuto incontro a noi con certe esigenze avremmo continuato con lui nel fare le stragi ma era un bluff perch non cera nessuna volont di andare avanti
6526224 mi diceva che lo contattava tramite questo amico e ci parlava questo amico suo per telefono perch poi loro si vedevano per i fatti suoi e poi lui aveva le conferme tramite questo suo amico
6526225 non stato mai per dire berlusconi ha mandato questo dellutri ha mandato questo o c questo canale alla mia presenza non c mai stato perch non ha niente a che fare con i problemi della citt quindi sicuramente i discorsi sono stati fatti per io non ne so nulla
6526226 brusca dice il vero quando afferma che la richiesta di trattare formulata da un organismo istituzionale a lui sconosciuto oggi si sa che erano gli uomini del ros indusse riina a pensare e a comunicare ai suoi accoliti che quelli si erano fatti sotto
6526227 circa lepoca in cui apprese di questa trattativa non si rivelato sicuro
6526228 mi disse quando sono uscito che aveva avuto degli agganci anche mesi prima che io uscissi con dellutri e quindi aveva avuto assicurazioni che insomma si sarebbe interessato per cosa nostra
6526229 ha paura ecco e quindi si aggancia ad altre persone per cui quando io sono poi in carcere dei soldi che mandava prima allanno li percepiva prima dalla parte di bontate con teresi quando invece poi io parlo in carcere per fargli dare qualche cosa a lui perch era stretto cio non aveva soldi mangano ci dico scusa li prendeva lui questi soldi adesso li prendete voi dateci un qualche cosa a lui a mangano vittorio e io lo dico a giovan battista pullar che era pullar che lo riceveva
6526230 non fate rumore perch altrimenti ci mettete in una condizione di non potere fare niente
6526231 si faremo faremo per stiamo attenti non facciamo succedere cose
6526232 a roma si era costituito un ottimo rapporto con il costruttore franco caltagirone a sua volta in rapporto con giulio andreotti dico meglio i graviano avevano ripreso un vecchio rapporto che il caltagirone aveva avuto con cosa nostra sin dai tempi di stefano bontade a milano i rapporti sempre per quanto dettomi da bagarella e confermatomi da cesare lupo erano stati costituiti da marcello dellutri con cui i graviano si incontravano personalmente la nascita ed il consolidarsi delle relazioni di cui ho appena detto concretizz definitivamente un rapporto di amicizia e di collaborazione su tutti i fronti con dellutri e conseguentemente con berlusconi questa non solo una mia deduzione ma fu oggetto di numerose conversazioni con leoluca bagarella oltre che con altri uomini di cosa nostra
6526233 ci sono molti collaboranti che dicono che io ho fatto votare forza italia ed vero ma ho fatto votare forza italia solo ed esclusivamente per andare contro la sinistra per un fatto ideologico mio
6526234 quando berlusconi tenne lultimo comizio della sua campagna elettorale a palermo presso la fiera del mediterraneo io ero presente su incarico di bagarella riferii poi allo stesso bagarella di una frase di berlusconi in cui si manifestava un vago proposito di utilizzare i voti contro la delinquenza bagarella mi disse che era una frase obbligata per lopinione pubblica e per i giornalisti dato che era stato contestato al berlusconi che non parlava mai di mafia ma in quella stessa occasione mi assicur ancora una volta che lo stesso aveva preso impegni seri con noi intendendo con tutta cosa nostra
6526235 nel gennaio 1994 mentre ci trovavamo presso il mio studio ubicato a palermo via nicol gallo n 14 ove leoluca bagarella con frequenza quasi quotidiana soleva raggiungermi avevo un colloquio con questultimo nelloccasione chiedevo al mio interlocutore come mai cosa nostra si era determinata a commettere le stragi in sicilia nel 92 e quelle successive nel continente nel 1993 e quali garanzie avevano avuto loro dal mondo politico e istituzionale per evitare le prevedibili conseguenze negative ricollegabili a tali fatti eclatanti a fronte di tale mio articolato ragionamento il bagarella replic per tranquillizzarmi dicendomi di non preoccuparmi perch avevano avuto delle garanzie e che si trattava solo di vedere se gli impegni presi sarebbero stati mantenuti subito dopo le elezioni non mi precis in questa sede da chi erano state date le garanzie ma mi assicur che comunque loperazione era stata studiata bene e che vi era la possibilit di accollare le stragi a organismi terroristici del tipo falange armata evidenzio che in quelloccasione non vi era nessuna altra persona presente
6526236 portava come novit che erano nate delle alleanze che doveva nascere questo partito nuovo e si dovevano creare visi nuovi
6526237 tutto deriva dai contatti fra alfano e dellutri disse avola riferendo fatti del tutto nuovi a messina alla fine del 1991 ci sono stati degli incontri cui hanno partecipato alfano sparacio dellutri ed alcuni uomini donore della famiglia catanese di cosa nostra
6526238 i primi progetti erano di colpire in alta italia non toccare la sicilia con le stragi
6526239 stava nascendo questo partito e si doveva appoggiare questa forza politica nuova che poi doveva aiutare un po tutta la situazione di cosa nostra
6526240 p m ma lei si riferisce a forza italia perch lo deduce da quello che successo dopo o perch le venne detto ad un certo punto avola mia moglie che me lo conferma al colloquio perch il dagata mi manda a dire che se il partito il partito era nato io sto parlando gi del 1993 il partito era nato e tutti sti pentiti ce li legavamo alle caviglie e non ti preoccupare che maurizio esce con i suoi piedi era fine 93

6526243 70 allepoca lo incontrava tra laltro ai congressi della democrazia cristiana
6526244 70 e di avere seguito levoluzione dei rapporti tra lui e dellutri
6526245 in realt il dott dellutri mi prospett la necessit di individuare nuovi referenti per il gruppo finivest in quanto quelli tradizionali non rappresentavano una capacit adeguata alle esigenze
6526246 secondo il quale il dott dellutri mi chiese di fare unoperazione di marketing sociale a seguito della quale potevano anche nascere possibilit di lavoro per publitalia ma che consisteva soprattutto in una serie quanto pi vasta possibile di contatti con gruppi o associazioni al fine di verificare lopinione che costoro avevano della situazione sociale e politica al fine di creare o migliorare i rapporti di queste associazioni enti e gruppi con il gruppo finivest attraverso la publitalia
6526247 il dottor dellutri decise di affidarmi il compito di dar vita ad un
6526248 si decise in quelloccasione di fare come venne detto un
6526249 nel luglio 93 presso lo studio del notaio roveda di milano venne costituita lassociazione
6526250 il progetto botticelli prevedeva di trasformare alcuni dirigenti dazienda in dirigenti del nascente partito politico dietro questo progetto cera sempre il dellutri come pu evincersi dal fatto che tutti i dirigenti del nuovo movimento sono stati arruolati dalle strutture di publitalia questo progetto confliggeva con quello originale che come ho detto prevedeva il coinvolgimento di forze sociali esterne alla fininvest la creazione di un nuovo soggetto politico con il semplice sostegno aperto da parte della fininvest questo progetto implicava chiaramente la costituzione di un soggetto politico certamente di centro e prevedeva anche il tentativo di coinvolgere una parte della sinistra moderata come per esempio amato il progetto botticelli invece era decisamente sbilanciato a destra e prevedeva il coinvolgimento sia della lega che dei missini
6526251 una volta compiuta la trasformazione dei quadri dirigenziali del gruppo in esponenti politici titolari di incarichi e cariche istituzionali il mio apporto si sarebbe dovuto concretizzare con una collaborazione non pi interna alla struttura imprenditoriale bens con un rapporto di consulenza con la presidenza del consiglio dei ministri io accettai lincarico che non si concretizz a causa della caduta del governo

6526253 la disgregazione dei singoli partiti nelle loro strutture personali organizzative ed elettorali cominciano a manifestarsi con tangentopoli la persona beneficiata da questo mutamento va identificata nellon le berlusconi il quale ebbe la capacit di creare un contenitore in cui quadri intermedi ed elettori dei vecchi partiti trovassero identit e sicurezza quella di berlusconi stata uniniziativa quasi estemporanea che consent di neutralizzare i partiti della sinistra che erano rimasti sostanzialmente intatti e dalla caduta del muro di berlino e dal primo avvento di tangentopoli la decisione di scendere in politica di berlusconi per quanto mi consta va collocata in un periodo di tempo di circa due tre mesi prima delle elezioni del 1994 ci posso dire con assoluta certezza perch ebbi parte nello sviluppo dei rapporti tra lon le berlusconi e il leader del p p i in particolare lon le berlusconi aveva pensato che la funzione di antagonista della sinistra potesse essere svolta dallarea del p p i riconducibile a martinazzoli si rese per conto che ci non poteva realizzarsi in quanto diversa era la visione della funzione che tale leader politico aveva del p p i rispetto a quella dellon le berlusconi solo nel momento in cui constat tale iato si determin a scendere direttamente in politica mi risulta che egli era disposto anche a devolvere a favore del partito popolare di martinazzoli la struttura riconducibile a forza italia che aveva iniziato a creare a far data dallestate del 1993 i collaboratori aziendali di berlusconi erano scettici dinanzi alla sua iniziativa di assumersi una responsabilit politica diretta mi viene richiesto di indicare chi siano stati i collaboratori che mostravano di non credere alla sua intuizione ed io dico praticamente tutti
6526254 soprattutto per la situazione in cui mi sarei trovato con il dott berlusconi la cui immagine sarebbe stata offuscata da quellarticolo ne parlai quindi con il dott dellutri che mi fiss un appuntamento con il dott confalonieri nel colloquio con questultimo io espressi la mia intenzione di lasciare villa san martino per lo stato di disagio che si era creato il confalonieri appresa la mia intenzione mi lasci libero di decidere e non mi chiese di andarmene
6526255 non ho mai incontrato n telefonato n cercato il dellutri dopo il 1990 non avrei mai cercato di incontrarmi con lui dopo essere stato condannato per gravi reati cercandolo avrei potuto soltanto portargli guai dopo tutto quello che successo

6526277 clearly the rise in the numbers seeing the us as a threat is motivated less by the belief that the us harbours military ambitions towards australia and more by anti american sentiment fostered by disenchantment with the fta free trade agreement and opposition to the iraq war

6526652 there are occasionally these kinds of connections issues but they usually resolve themselves in 24 hours

6526823 in march i quit my job borrowed 30k from family members and put everything on the line to build a company around the iphone platform i now have a great product thats been ready for over a month but hasnt seen the light of day apple didnt properly prepare for the flood my user friendly functional application has languished while 22 tip calculators 8 flashlights and even i am rich made it to the store and worse yet there has been a complete lack of communication about any of it procedures contracts status time estimates etc the dream of creating great iphone apps has turned into a personal nightmare ive been losing sleep feeling sick gaining weight and i just about had an emotional breakdown today
6526824 yesterday i noticed from my itunes that apple had recently released 2 0 1 for the iphone i downloaded the 240 megabyte update a little while later i received an unknown error 6 and the update aborted but not until after it had erased my phone so for the second time in the past couple of months my phone became a brick my impression is that apple cant cope with the success of the iphone and the demands it puts on their engineering and support organizations
6526825 i am a doctor but not a good typist and i have found that dragon naturallyspeaking dns is indispensable in making entries into my electronic medical record emr program dns has saved me literally thousands of hours in the last few years in updating my patients records but i purchased a copy of dns version 10 as soon as it was available and tried to begin dictating into my emr dns stopped dead a dialog box appeared stating that the only version of naturally speaking 10 that would dictate into an emr was the medical version of dragon which costs 10 times the price very sad that nuance has chosen to take the low road in dealing with its new and established customers
6526826 you are correct that we decided to remove emr support from the non medical versions of dragon

6526839 its a tricky situation because if the mdc fails to take up its seats in parliament two things could happen after a certain number of days absent from parliament the elected officials could lose their seat and consequently that seat could then go to a bye election and given the current climate in zimbabwe that could be quite a dangerous thing for the mdc
6526840 they will not be in a position to elect the speaker and deputy speaker of parliament and these are very important positions they could lose that opportunity to zanu pf party
6526841 yes the mdc says if parliament is convened it is a violation of the memorandum of understanding which was the document that set the agenda for talks and in that document the parties agreed that parliament would not be reconvened without consensus however it may come down to deciding what is the best option on the day because the talks have not reached an agreement yet regarding a possible government of national unity and the leaders in southern africa are very keen that this agreement be reached as soon as possible but there are disagreements about what powers will be held by the various parties and particularly the party leaders in such a cabinet
6526842 at the weekend south african president thabo mbeki who is the mediator or facilitator of the talks said that he would like to go up to zimbabwe by the end of this week in order to resume the mediation

6526915 a friend of mine who exhibited there said you really ought to do this its just all about the art the people who come seem to want to look at art and talk about art
6526916 people who come are very interested in the art and how its accomplished
6526917 i think they appreciate art they appreciate being on the grounds and its small enough that someone who comes can see everything
6526918 the excitement for me in encausting its very much like watercolor its not a controlled medium
6526919 its entirely serendipitous to what you get you have to be very open and very receptive to what youre going to get
6526920 now im trying to fuse my photography with my painting with encaustics with found objects
6526921 it brings in nature which i love and the eastern religions which im quite interested in
6526922 it means different things as you look at it basically a mandala to me is a design with repeating patterns around a center most people recognize them as a kaleidoscope picture because most people have had a kaleidoscope when they were a child
6526923 thats one of the exciting things to me about living in the digital world
6526924 im trying to get at how we understand the world and interact with it
6526925 a friend suggested or requested that i do a painting or two on the subject of creation
6526926 so i did a few and one thing led to another that led to a series that people for lack of a better word called the cosmos
6526927 i like to think that good artwork can help people see things without their eyes
6526928 it should let you to do something more than just say mmm nice there should be something more to the experience
6526929 it always provides the utmost challenge to the artist watercolor is unforgiving i think as a medium its one of those things you either get it right or you throw it out
6526930 theres such a diverse number of things to choose from as a painter
6526931 section 1 of our post and we had placed a named link such as

6526934 kevin just wasnt into recording the 2005 album never gone in a creative way there were disagreements on every direction the band was taking and he left because he realized he was hurting the group
6526935 with him gone there dont seem to be as many conflicts we arent bumping heads anymore and things are flowing better musically
6526936 there can be no room for doubt four is the strongest we are the backstreet boys

6526939 i was thrown into the whole reality tv world before i should have been i had issues i had to go through and unfortunately i went through them on television
6526940 i saw myself on television in an unhealthy state both physically and mentally it opened my eyes
6526941 i stopped drinking i got back in shape it took me two years but ive changed my life around
6526942 mmm hmm and when you say junk foods you mean
6526943 well scott i guess i would start with the fritos crumbs on your shirt there i think we can safely assume that to be junk food
6526944 but doc im saving those for later plus theyre corn chips theyre made with real corn isnt corn healthy
6526945 im sorry doc surely i am i guess im just confused as to what i can eat
6526946 yes scott outside you know the place you have to walk through to get to your car

6526949 im going to show you what you can eat from now on heres my pocketknife go ahead and scrape off a piece of that bark there scott
6526950 id start by boiling it for 20 minutes maybe add some low sodium seasoning
6526951 not necessarily just bark scott but mostly things that taste like bark you can make a nice pine needle salad spruce it up with some acorns some sawdust maybe some bermuda grass and honeysuckle
6526952 dont worry about those rabbits scott theyll make it just fine you just eat on those roots and shrubs and youll be okay
6526953 this is what you get for a lifetime of rocket burgers and funyuns scotty boy i dont know what to tell you
6526954 i think you doctors just made up the words high cholesterol to make money for the rabbit food people i mean really cholesterol that doesnt even sound like a real word that sounds like something my 11 month old nephew said
6526955 wow youre cranky already scott that usually doesnt start until day three of the tree bark diet
6526956 what about dessert doc do i at least get a nice slice of cheesecake after my oak tree
6526957 sure if you make your cheesecake out of wood pulp and tofu
6526958 did my insurance company put you up to this is this because i called them cannibal hmo nazis because ill apologize doc
6526959 well it probably wasnt your smartest move scott but no theyre out of the loop on this one
6526960 well my friend youll be as regular as the atomic clock from here on out but thats really all i can give you now go ahead and finish that bark there

6526975 there is nothing new that is being said every countrys position is well known but the question is whether we can take a decision either way by tomorrow
6526976 this is our country and we have to save it lets debate this for however long we want but the house should find a solution and tell the government how to deal with the situation
6526977 we cannot allow terrorists to challenge the writ of the government how is it fair that terrorists can give the government one week time to resign and threaten to start bombing if they dont get their way we have to secure the lives and property of our people if we do not stop them now tomorrow they may attack this very house they may cause a terrorist incident inside the house they may take the members hostage
6526978 the war on terror cannot be won on defensive we have to take the battle to the doorsteps of the extremists
6526979 we are not being attacked by any outside military or a known army our enemy lurks silently within our society this is our own war
6526980 it was impressive the way vijender fought in the quarterfinals and confirmed a medal he used his intelligence he used the boxing tactics and strategy to the maximum in that bout this is what is required at the highest level
6526981 well cuba is better known for its boxers that will have some pressure on vijender
6526982 however there is no doubt that vijender is capable of rising to the occasion if he settles down quickly and implements the strategy he can call the shots
6526983 in boxing you never know you can never say anything for sure
6526984 i think leukemia taught me to think step by step
6526985 when youre lying in the hospital bed feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you dont want to think about the next week or next month youre only thinking about the next hour
6526986 you just have to be patient you lie in your bed and just wait its almost the same strategy ive used here to stay in the pack to be patient and stay easy just waiting for a chance

6526998 i spoke to the prime minister on the phone and he told me that everybody was on the streets he told me that i had written history

6527000 my coach has taken me to be a double olympic champion and a double world record holder
6527001 i was very happy when i won a medal i ran fast then they told me that they usa sent a protest and i lost my medal i was very disappointed but i cant do too much i stepped on the line and they saw it it is bad for me i guess and good for them i have got to move on i was very sad that i lost my medal but i know what i am capable of i am just going to practise and come back harder the next time
6527002 for a country of 140 000 inhabitants his performance was fantastic the procedure was not right and not fair
6527003 would churandy have been disqualified if wallace hadnt been disqualified and the us head coach had not analysed the race
6527004 it will take some more time for operations to stabilise we are committed to providing world class infrastructure in a time bound manner by the end of this year domestic terminal 1 d will be ready while the new terminal 3 will come up by early 2010 as of now flight movement at delhi airport is 35 40 per hour and it will go up to 60 with the coming into being of the third runway

6527006 really early in his presidential campaign when i got the opportunity to listen intently to his ideas and his platforms i immediately said this is beyond belief
6527007 i joined the effort and it became clear to me that i was better able to work in my community in a broad way and support this outstanding candidate as a democrat
6527008 if its going to be a close election it could be a huge factor
6527009 youre going to see some turnout like youve never seen before in the state of florida
6527010 my goal here is that african americans who have voted democratic their entire lives will begin to at least consider a republican candidate
6527011 and then ill move to the second goal of registration but it is a slow process
6527012 its a funny thing about obama but when i see him speak and see him on the stage i dont see him as a black man i just see a man he symbolizes hope and we surely need hope
6527013 after the semifinals i knew that i would run a personal best i had a strategy i stuck to it and now i am an olympic champion
6527014 i felt good coming off the turn i didnt have anything left i ran the best i could i am disappointed if i had run like i did in the semifinals i could have won
6527015 it was very fast and calm i was confident about how things would go i feel good to be the olympic champion my technique has improved significantly this year
6527016 there was some pressure but there was a lot of motivation from my team jamaica is doing very well i am just happy for everybody
6527017 i dont know how i did it i surprised myself i usually win with my first throw i have never won with my last attempt this is the first time
6527018 i have won at the world championships but an olympic medal is more difficult
6527019 when it was raining hard it was not bothering me but when it came to the high jump i just couldnt get my footing

6527033 they are senior advocates and did not tender either conditional or unconditional apology for their conduct in the bmw case
6527034 they have forfeited their right to enjoy the honour conferred on them by this court of being designated as senior advocates
6527035 given the facts of this case we are of the view that this is not one of those rare and brazen cases where we should initiate suo motu action against ndtv for contempt of court
6527036 he anand has been an mp of the rajya sabha that he should indulge in such practice may have taken many in legal fraternity by surprise

6527042 but even castro was upstaged in the audience appreciation department by the rich voiced 17 year old david archuleta who comes across as so nice and earnest and aw shucks you like me you really like me its futile to find fault with his gushy pop numbers hes a star for today at least and deserves his time in the spotlight
6527043 its ok mom i obsess over things all the time too
6527044 in david i believe that he is a spirit so rare and a personality so innocence that it leaves me with a sense of passionate helplessness as to what to do with him i must support and enjoy him in everything that he does

6527067 ive personally picked up houses that were facing foreclosure for 60 000 with a short sale then i was able to turn around and sell it for as much as 80 000 just a few weeks later thats 20 000 of profit for just five to seven hours of work
6527068 youve got to have a proven system and do it right to get those kind of results the fact is there have been a lot of people entering the foreclosure market without the right plan and they got burned weve made our share of mistakes along the way and we want to help people avoid making these same costly errors the foreclosure epidemic is a great opportunity for those who are properly informed

6527084 this is a war scenario and fury is the most experienced tactical fighter among them
6527085 once the battle is joined there may not be an opportunity for organizing or tactics alternately thor may provide the distraction fury needs to be able to mobilize his ad hoc army more effectively than he could with skrulls on every street
6527086 neither of them is aligned with any other heroes for the most part at the moment and theyre also spread out away from manhattan a lot of the time so it made sense that we might not see them get involved in a major way until now

6527091 will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
6527092 if a manned airplane is on a conveyor belt and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
6527093 will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
6527094 a manned plane is sitting on a conveyor belt which has the ability to instantaneously match the speed of the plane but in the opposite direction when the plane throttles up will it be held in place or will it take off
6527095 and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions
6527096 held in place is in reference to the ground its really just simple english and sentence structure but you apparently dont get it this holds true with every version of the myth that has been presented here
6527097 what were seeing is a bit of a belated catch up in canada to the surge in global food prices we saw earlier this year
6527098 because even with the pullback in grain prices theyre still well up from a year ago
6527099 some of that strength in grain prices earlier this year was for real
6527100 partly its just a matter of food companies making sure that its not just a fluke thats going to be quickly reversed
6527101 grain prices make up only a small share about two per cent of the actual final food price
6527102 unfortunately canadians are going to be experiencing continued pressure on food prices in the future
6527103 earlier this year we were faced by just some astronomical unprecedented commodity price increases
6527104 weve seen some relief in the area of wheat pricing its only double what it was last year versus being triple or quadruple the price
6527105 we are big users of both electricity and natural gas as well as producing a fresh product our industry has trucks on the road everyday delivering
6527106 when you look at energy in total theres been significant pressure on all forms of energy but the most acute of late has been transportation costs
6527107 packaging if its plastic its petroleum based so theres been pressures there
6527108 were starting to see the results of all those inflationary price pressures materialize at the retail level
6527109 mind you we still have an incredibly incredibly competitive retail environment
6527110 so just how much of that pressure will materialize at the retail level thats something for the market to decide
6527111 its possible that some of the grain prices we saw earlier this year were in bubble territory
6527112 is that even with a short pullback theyre still in some cases double where they were a year ago
6527113 were faced with on the agriculture side increasing demand worldwide and significant challenges with supply so prices go up

6527115 jarno wie ist dein erster eindruck von der strecke und von valencia
6527116 bisher ist es sch n warm und sonnig die strecke siegt gut aus aber wir m ssen nat rlich abwarten bis der alltag eines rennwochenendes beginnt um festzustellen was f r eine art strecke es ist wir wissen ja nicht viel dar ber aber bisher sieht es gut aus alles ist sehr gut organisiert und die atmosph re wird sicher klasse denn wir sind in spanien und es werden sicher eine menge spanischer fans kommen
6527117 nun ich habe sie mir schon angeschaut aber im moment kann man es noch schwer beurteilen weil man nicht wei wie hoch der speed in gewissen kurven genau sein wird ich muss aber sagen dass es generell eine sichere strecke ist soweit ich das sehen konnte haben sie einen recht vern nftigen job gemacht aber es vielleicht noch zu fr h um genaues zu sagen
6527118 wir haben schon gut angefangen und das auto immer weiter verbessert
6527119 toyota hat in den letzten rennen zwei podiumspl tze geholt was erwartest du vom rest der saison wird es noch weiterentwicklungen geben wie geht es bei toyota weiter
6527120 ich denke dass das team in diesem jahr einen sehr guten job macht wir haben schon gut angefangen und das auto immer weiter verbessert das team treibt die entwicklungsarbeit weiter voran deshalb bin ich zuversichtlich dass wir bis zum saisonende weitere gute ergebnisse holen werden es gibt bedingungen und rennstrecken auf denen wir extrem stark sind wie es zum beispiel in ungarn und magny cours der fall war auf anderen kursen haben wir vielleicht mehr probleme aber ich denke trotzdem dass wir in jedem qualifying um die top 10 mitk mpfen k nnen unser ziel ist nat rlich in jedem rennen zu punkten unser ziel ist platz vier bei den herstellern zu holen
6527121 ja wir haben sogar hier welche dabei wir haben immer irgendetwas neues am auto das team konzentriert sich zwar schon auf die entwicklung des n chstj hrigen autos es arbeitet aber auch noch sehr hart am aktuellen auto weil es im kampf um platz vier sehr eng zugeht wir w rden gerne diesen vierten platz holen
6527122 wie sieht die situation zwischen dir und dem team f r n chstes jahr aus
6527123 wir haben einen g ltigen vertrag also glaube ich dass wir n chstes jahr zusammenbleiben k nnen
6527124 we have done as youve asked and not said anything to anybody
6527125 i have been involved with rock the vote since its inception and proud of the work they have done
6527126 there are such critical issues facing our country from high gas prices to climate change that we need to do more then just register to vote we need to get our friends registered too
6527127 since the april 8 2008 statement was issued we have learned that the trust does not own an aa rated collateralized corporate debt portfolio our funds were used to insure collateralized debt owned by one of the investment companies involved while the description of the investment portfolio contained in the april 8 statement is accurate the school districts have recently learned that they do not own the corporate debt described second a portion of the funds were placed in a collateral investment account that included higher risk investments among the higher risk investments were some sub prime mortgages we were assured that we were not being sold any sub prime debt third the april 8 statement indicated that the investments would pay the total amount promised if the corporate debt obligations were held to maturity in five years unfortunately since the school district does not own the corporate debt obligations described there is no guarantee that the full amount promised in the investment will be recovered these and other discoveries have led the school district to join in legal proceedings against those who made the investments on behalf of the school districts involved
6527128 i dont care whats going on in that vehicle if you drive like that you better have a child in that vehicle not a damn dog
6527129 i said youre joking and she says no im serious my boss wants you to leave the fair grounds and i said tell your boss to come down here and tell me that
6527130 they didnt have any they said its too graphic they said my wife is too graphic because shes paralyzed
6527131 first i apologize for the problems and inconvenience our booth has caused you second we removed mr harn from tonights schedule as a volunteer and we have vocalized this to him so should he come to the fair it will not be as a volunteer for madd
6527132 this is a family fair families dont want to come here and see a woman in that type of state
6527133 i lost my best friend last year in a car accident and i saw her in that vegetative state for you know like a week before she died it was really offending i actually had to end up leaving work early because i couldnt handle it
6527134 marcus how do you not see 50 hes the linebacker rushing the quarterback how do you miss him
6527135 our goal is always to deliver sports to fans across any platform and this is yet another agreement that fulfills that strategy
6527136 bring our game to our fans in a variety of new and exciting ways
6527137 defense won todays game we were a team on defense
6527138 if people want to assess the blame to me thats ok
6527139 i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out we had good chemistry the hand was back there she was there i dont know what happened
6527140 then i went to grab it and there was nothing
6527141 its kind of the way its been happening to me this olympics
6527142 every fullback gets the ball two times a year whether he likes it or not
6527143 theres so much magic in the world and sometimes we let life trample that down
6527144 if i can get every single guy on our team to understand the dynamics and believe in those dynamics and have that pumping in their heart were going to graduate 100 percent of our guys keep 100 percent of our guys out of trouble were going to win all our games
6527145 thats my quest always with these guys getting them to realize that
6527146 i think hell be ok well just have to tape it up and keep it from moving around
6527147 i think its good for our receivers to have more competition
6527148 because every day you have to push yourself to do the best you can or you are going to get passed up
6527149 that had to be a big confidence builder for him
6527150 when you see he gave up nine hits eight in the first four innings you think he did okay but he was better than okay
6527151 we are playing the best baseball we have all year but unfortunately we are still 10 games 59 69 below 500 weve painted ourselves into a corner
6527152 he has been very effective against the dodgers throughout his career which says something because this is a challenging park and they have always had solid pitching
6527153 it was a very graphic description of what he was going to do to me very violent things
6527154 ill talk about it all someday i dont care ill open up with the ugliest of uglies there are things i havent shared with anybody yet
6527155 i was feeling such anxiety and stress that i would just go home and i would cry id think i just cant take this if you are an experienced athlete who trains four hours a day six days a week and focuses every minute on your technique does it still take you 10 years like coaches say it does i didnt know if i could do it even on friday im not sure im going to show that i accomplished that
6527156 the next day he left a message saying i would win a gold medal in 2004 and in 2005 i would retire and have his baby
6527157 ive never had a phone call like that i didnt know if it was a joke it just grew from there fedex packages of roses plans for our marriage moving to france
6527158 you come and get him right now or youre going to have a girl whos going off the deep end
6527159 well doesnt he have that tattoo on his arm that says us pro but the us is crossed out and france is written beneath it
6527160 it affected me i lost a lot of my joy a lot of my naivete
6527161 its embarrassing its embarrassing to say i considered going on anti anxiety medication and antidepressants but the more you talk about it with people the more you realize how many people deal with anxieties its so common just being a human being is not easy so ive learned not to be embarrassed and at least i can share my story with others so they know theyre not alone
6527162 i was always skiing by myself and always felt a little scared
6527163 once i thought for sure i saw bear tracks and i thought oh god i might get eaten alive out here and no ones going to know where i am
6527164 ive been on the edge to the point that this was not a mentally healthy endeavor
6527165 my family for the first year asked me to not do this
6527166 the financial stress because i had to sell my house to do it the mental stress i was losing falling off the horse its tough to take after you win a gold medal in one sport and you win a world championship in another sport you find yourself getting humiliated time and time again youre broke financially nobody really believes you can do it
6527167 when you get sent back because you are not good enough you have to say okay what do i need to do he was sent down with specific things to work on with his stroke he came back with a much better approach at the plate
6527168 we have to find a way to get him back into play but we also are at a pivotal point of the season where we need production
6527169 i dont know the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer
6527170 tony and i both laughed at that we got a chuckle out of it
6527171 maybe but carrie shouldnt have made that comment in the first place
6527172 i said thank you i followed you a lot growing up when you were with the mariners he kind of chuckled at that
6527173 ive already had kind of a minor experience like that because cameron maybin used to come around a lot and see us play
6527174 he was like oh man its so cool seeing you here
6527175 i thought so highly of you then and its great to see you out there
6527176 kind of exposed me a little bit to some things i needed to work on
6527177 when i was struggling when i was up the first time this year
6527178 i was like im not this bad of a player this is not me so i was never like im not going to be a good player i never doubted myself i just knew that wasnt the type of player i was i just needed to fix something
6527179 is a gift that hes got and i just wanted him to be aware of that
6527180 his confidence isnt going to get shaken even when the strikeouts were high hes not a guy thats going to panic because of the confidence and you cant really teach that or talk to somebody about that you got to just have that hes going to figure things out
6527181 strikeouts were way too high way too many swings and misses not enough productive at bats
6527182 he was patient to a fault i felt he took too many fastballs especially against left handed pitching one of the things i preach as a hitting coach and i preach as a manager left on left hit the fastball unless you think youre good enough to hit the slider or the curveball or something else and if its 2 inches inside or 2 inches off the plate or 2 inches up or 2 inches down hit the fastball and that wasnt something he was in tune with early
6527183 its been more often than not more patience more often than not better discipline and obviously more barrel showing up
6527184 it was about 140 feet from where he would stand to a fence
6527185 every 50 feet from the fence is a huge sprinkler he started at the very first sprinkler and when he could hit over the fence with regularity i would move him back another 50 feet
6527186 i couldnt really do it because there were homes and cars along the street still to this day he tells me try to take the pitchers head off because thats what he would tell me he didnt want me hitting it back at him angled slightly to the plate so he wanted me hitting it up the middle
6527187 i thought the biggest thing was just getting his hands in a position to work without a whole lot of his body getting in the way
6527188 i dont think i was getting a proper load in the swing
6527189 i was kind of just going forward jumping at the ball instead of staying back
6527190 when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember
6527191 why is it that every child that comes into contact with him is broken
6527192 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children

6527195 pointed out that because pollina made his switch on the day of the candidate filing deadline he never actually participated in the progressive party primary
6527196 that comment resulted in a quick rebuttal from secretary of state deb markowitz a democrat who pointed out that because pollina made his switch on the day of the candidate filing deadline he never actually participated in the progressive party primary
6527197 thats how i got quite a few wins they thought i was just a kid and couldnt play that well
6527198 theyre definitely playing theyre definitely getting better and theyve got some of the older players worried about that
6527199 it was really cool for a 13 year old it was a lot of excitement and i won us 1 000 which was a large part of it as well
6527200 when we started there were maybe six people under 18 not more than 10 for sure
6527201 and now theres maybe 20 or 30 at every u s nationals we go to
6527202 some of these kids honestly they were so serious i was really surprised at how serious they were they were concentrating and it was just quiet
6527203 if you asked them what do you learn by playing scrabble they would say well im just having fun but they dont understand the whole math and spatial awareness and letters and spelling and all that stuff
6527204 its a sort of fascinating game when you play an interesting word theres a beauty about it it sort of captivates you and makes you want to do it again and again
6527205 the words are there but theyre more like tools kind of to building a higher score
6527206 the way you use the board and the pieces and all of the letters have a different point value and so youre trying to use all of that to get the highest score
6527207 for young people its a lot easier to memorize things because when you get older you start losing your memory
6527208 mr tippett is not going to be tried in the press in the bedrooms or the barrooms
6527209 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6527210 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6527211 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6527212 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6527213 amid long lead times for large scale mining equipment high fuel prices and ever increasing capital costs we contend that investors can find some shelter in high grade underground mines in established mining camps
6527214 kirkland lake gold continues to be a show me story as operational challenges arising from poor equipment availability and a lack of skilled miners continue to negatively impact operating performance
6527215 kids reject the bad taste of medicine because its basic biology their system is designed to reject that taste because many toxic substances are bitter and distasteful
6527216 our basic biology is telling us to reject bitter that its poison were really designed to reject this stuff
6527217 when it comes to many of the senses childhood is a time of heightened sensitivity the preference for sweet and salt starts shifting in adolescence
6527218 i would caution those who make medicines not to make them so palatable that kids think theyre candy
6527219 my favorite trick is chocolate syrup before and after the medicine
6527220 a lot of times children refuse a food and parents give in and dont offer it again but parents need to persevere and offer the foods again repeated exposure may help
6527221 this so incredible dad look around were at the olympics
6527222 typically its the undecided voter that gives politicians a hard time its the undecided voters that you need to get
6527223 this study shows that by using these measures there is some potential for improving the prediction of election outcomes
6527224 the inspiration for this study came from the development of a particular class of measures that enables us to assess these automatic mental associations
6527225 over the past couple of years a lot of research has shown that these measures are able to predict behaviors that psychologists have had a hard time predicting with standard methodology or self report
6527226 this type of measure in the domain of prejudice and stereotyping has found that in north america there is a large proportion of individuals with relatively negative views of african americans even people who hold very strong egalitarian opinions or beliefs sometimes show negative associations
6527227 this can influence their voting behavior particularly for undecided voters in a way that they may not be aware of
6527228 we know that there is still a strong prevalence of automatic negative associations regarding african americans and this may have distorted peoples perception of the political process public debates etc
6527229 theyve made up their mind who theyre going to vote for even though theyre undecided when the polls are taken this could happen again in the u s it may be the case that the big advance that obama has at this point may completely shift in the election

6527232 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch everyone is living in fear
6527233 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class
6527234 a real decision is measured by the fact that youve taken a new action if theres no action you havent truly decided
6527235 dont think in terms of comfort think in terms of freedom dont think in terms of safety think in terms of being more alive and the only way to be more alive is to live dangerously is to risk is to go on an adventure and the greatest adventure is not going to the moon the greatest adventure is going to your own innermost core
6527236 we should try to be the parents of our future rather than the offspring of our past
6527237 go for the risk its better to fail spectacularly than to pass along and do something which is mediocre
6527238 there is no place where ones body actually ends and no place where it begins
6527239 truth is an experience not a belief truth never comes by studying about it truth has to be encountered truth has to be faced
6527240 the question is not can you make a difference you already do make a difference its just a matter of what kind of difference you want to make during your life on this planet
6527241 occasionally in life there are those moments of unutterable fulfillment which cannot be completely explained by those symbols called words their meanings can only be articulated by the inaudible language of the heart
6527242 the whole 1968 prague invasion was really overblown western propaganda
6527243 we will host a russian missile system in our country to counter the us
6527244 my vp wont be like that other vice president who thinks he is above the law
6527245 we forget it was the reforms of the prague spring that led to this today we must not put all the blame on russia it did apologise for the soviet unions deeds but take other countries of the warsaw pact who were also involved we have good relations with them today
6527246 it was at the height of the cold war not just a confrontation of two socio political systems but also of two political blocks nato and the warsaw pact the military parity was fragile and unstable but the whole world depended on it
6527247 we are already two generations away from those events for the people who witnessed them theyre alive but todays generation simply cant understand them

6527277 its half past seven at night we decided that saving chase was a priority at lunchtime
6527278 i usually have the gallery open until ten on a friday
6527279 so 7 30 is early its not as if silver steve is a killer is it it didnt try to hurt pennie
6527280 we dont know if silver steve had anything to do with their deaths
6527281 ill admit that yes just not the intent i mean look at it from hunts point of view
6527282 he goes to all the trouble of hiring this demon
6527283 keritel yes to help him create a life sized homunculus which costs him thousands of pounds and time and effort and then he sends it to kill a couple of nobodies and one of his ex wives why why bother it would have been a lot easier to just poison them hell hiring an assassin would have been cheaper
6527284 then why did he go to all that trouble in the first place why send steve to pennies flat at all why make him at all
6527285 im sure well find out soon enough what does a demon want with a homunculus wouldnt an imp be better suited for just about any job
6527286 they have free will remember like all demonkin while they are bound to serve their masters they do it in their own good time take wrack for example wheres he gone we come out of the gallery and he buggers off looking for go who knows what
6527287 if we had the answers wed be the lords of misrule
6527288 im not so sure the lords of misrule know whats going on half the time and i damned sure god doesnt ineffability notwithstanding
6527289 its not marked on here do you know where it is
6527290 but i can find it easily enough i can smell it from here
6527291 i very much doubt he locks himself in with padlocks on the outside
6527292 i could hop over the gate and take a look
6527293 what if he is here how will i know youre all right
6527294 did you know there were dozens of frickin animals in there
6527295 what i put a donation in the slot on the wall
6527296 that was the down and out of the animal kingdom
6527297 should we try pennies house again the police should be long gone so he might try to get in
6527298 except for the lone policeman guarding the entrances he said theres been no one but me since he came on shift at four
6527299 yes i said i was from the paper wanted the low down on developments for the late edition no news of pennie or steve but i did find out that the morisses in the ground floor flat were gassed
6527300 not really there are a lot worse ways to die my point is that its possible that their deaths were accidental too maybe silver steve kicked the gas pipe or something
6527301 how should i know why dont you ask them youre the one that talks to dead people
6527302 only if theyre earthbound or they didnt believe in an afterlife
6527303 i cant see pennies neighbours besides she said shed seen them ride the escalator to heaven
6527304 whats the betting they were shown the firemans pole of unearthly delights when they got up there
6527305 the only thing to do now would be to go to chases house
6527306 as a matter of fact i did but she didnt know where he lives either
6527307 fat lot of good that is then have you got his phone number
6527308 we could go back to the animal sanctuary break into the office find the employee records and get his address from there
6527309 you couldnt have thought of that when we were there before
6527310 look can we stop at a chippy you may have eaten but im famished
6527311 you can have them in a bag and eat them sat on the bonnet
6527312 it was in with his accounts did you know how much debt chase is in
6527313 and why didnt we think of this before you and your it doesnt want to hurt anybody
6527314 she looked over to see felicia dive under steves legs dragging her broken one she had partially wered ripping her clothes that would annoy her more then the broken limb she hated ripping her clothes
6527315 no i cant just tread on it nor drop it in salt water
6527316 what a sigil which one kaeylarae i dont know it
6527317 where did these scars come from were they a gang initiation
6527318 this is a pub not a restaurant you have to go to the bar if you want anything
6527319 theres a press of people there that id rather not be pressed against do you think we could go somewhere a tad quieter
6527320 i wish id come here last night i might have got my brains shagged out and be still alive
6527321 when your time comes theres nothing you can do about it
6527322 i was on my deathbed once and refused to die i was up and about again the next day
6527323 and about the time you saved the world from the second coming
6527324 what i want to know though is how youre wandering about like you were still alive when my uncle became mortally challenged he was confined to the environs of his death
6527325 i just wish i could ask you to go to the bar youd get through the press no bother
6527326 pretty girl like you should be able to pick up a couple of spirits
6527327 i think i overslept a bit did you get me a pint in
6527328 ive been coming here years and ive never had service like that
6527329 i used to help her out when i worked at the factories
6527330 nah i used to nick stuff for her clothing warehouses make up shipments that kind of thing
6527331 you used to spend all day trying not to do any work and then complain come friday that they hadnt paid you for the mornings youd come in late now youre the director of a cutting edge tech company youve got your own hours your own staff and as many breaks as you want youve got more money to play with that anyone ive ever met and youre about to marry my sister youre the luckiest man alive
6527332 i havent got you to look after me though and i get these headaches all the time what wont go away
6527333 sometimes theyre here and sometimes theyre at the base of me skull
6527334 not right now like else id have to go for a lie down but they happen most days i just sleep it off but its a bit worrying i never had nothing like this working at wheatons
6527335 how long have you had these headaches sam this is the first time youve mentioned them
6527336 if i wasnt the director id get the sack im hardly ever there
6527337 can we go somewhere else id be partial to a cup of tea
6527338 they serve beer and tea all night coffee too if youre into that
6527339 its noisy here i dont get headaches when its noisy
6527340 they get the teachers from the comprehensive in there on a friday theyll be having their darts match
6527341 i remember them from when we were kids you had to buy the teachers a pint else theyd shop your real age to the barman
6527342 all right he said one more in here and then well go up to the art
6527343 this is sam hunt only dont get me wrong but this bloke looks as if he couldnt find his arse with both hands how can he have made a robot bent on killing people
6527344 this is the sam i worked with all those years the one i helped through his apprenticeship i havent seen him like this in ages its as if hes back to his normal self
6527345 nobody could be that much of an idiot unless they were possessed by goofy the whatever goofy was supposed to be
6527346 anyway that doesnt matter the point is sams usually being possessed and now he isnt i dont know why not but if we can work it out we can drive the demon away
6527347 pluto was a dog and he was far more intelligent than goofy
6527348 drink up mate youve got two pints in front of you there
6527349 ive seen you put away a dozen of those and not miss a step you can make an exception for my stag night surely this time tomorrow ill be your brother
6527350 ive tried to keep off the pop since the accident
6527351 its times like this i wish i were still alive
6527352 its pretty disgusting this is the first time ive been glad i dont have a sense of smell any longer
6527353 what are you doing in here anyway you cant just have been curious
6527354 perhaps thats only if youd found somewhere you wanted to be i never really did care for that flat id go and haunt steven if he wasnt dead already
6527355 no though you have an edge if you want to know he wanted me to tell you that sam isnt possessed right now he say that this is the sam he used to know the demons not inside him
6527356 by the distinct lack of scintillating conversation and the fact that he couldnt see you all demons can see the supernatural it comes with the species
6527357 i havent a clue ill work it out later when its not so loud that i cant think
6527358 during this time we need to offer each other support the young people who may have had tragedy it brings up those issues for all the students theres just real need here

6527501 it is a stylized flag designed to blend the stars on senator obamas shirt with the flag blowing in the wind
6527502 really early in his presidential campaign when i got the opportunity to listen intently to his ideas and his platforms i immediately said this is beyond belief
6527503 i joined the effort and it became clear to me that i was better able to work in my community in a broad way and support this outstanding candidate as a democrat

6527506 my goal here is that african americans who have voted democratic their entire lives will begin to at least consider a republican candidate
6527507 and then ill move to the second goal of registration but it is a slow process
6527508 its a funny thing about obama but when i see him speak and see him on the stage i dont see him as a black man i just see a man he symbolizes hope and we surely need hope

6527516 utterly fabulous a world of sleek towering walls of lighting ambiguous modern art and both guests and employees in head to toe black
6527517 from the moment you walk in and breathe the faintly tropically perfumed air we think its vanilla and enter the lush rainforest its just a different experience from most vegas hotels

6527522 parents can request a channel change if their pet prefers watching people on the news or real animals on animal planet

6527528 people get themselves into situations because the airport experience puts them in a stressful situation maybe theyre someone who doesnt fly a lot and being at the airport makes them stressed and frustrated thats when we get called in
6527529 someone travelers may think theyve divested themselves of metal but then they set off the machines and have to go through a second screening they may get caustic with a screener and say things that are inappropriate airport law enforcement also responds to those incidents
6527530 you have to recognize that your actions and the items youre carrying are taken very seriously when youre transitioning from the non sterile area of the airport to the sterile secure side of an airport
6527531 this is now the area where the airline may determine that the individual is unfit to fly and may summon a law enforcement officer to be on hand and detain the individual if they become a threat
6527532 traveling is stressful and can bring things out in us that wouldnt happen in normal situations
6527533 if it can happen it probably will so you have to mentally prepare yourself to roll with unforeseen circumstance and things that are outside your control

6527553 we urge beneficiaries to choose wisely when selecting their drug coverage
6527554 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress
6527555 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6527556 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6527557 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6527558 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source

6527575 wir hatten schon probleme vor dem turnier als wir unsere goalgetterin verloren dann unterlagen wir in der ersten partie gegen norwegen aber wir haben uns zur ck in den wettbewerb gek mpft und am ende das geholt wof r wir hergekommen sind die goldmedaille

6527582 well it is nice to run across fellow cocksuckers here on the island
6527583 hey wait a minute it is not our honeymoon our brides are just out shopping today
6527584 causing us to question the sustainability of margin expansion given higher than expected commodity costs
6527585 our strategy of moderately increasing service prices is working and we plan to continue this strategy for the next several years
6527586 however in the near term my optimism has to be moderated by the current state of the economy which is adversely impacting consumer related businesses we are no exception
6527587 let heaven sustain me in its embrace because i am honored above it
6527588 virgin mother who brought forth the king of the whole world
6527589 that she has brought forth god as man and even as supreme king
6527590 we should realize that mary means lady in the syrian language
6527591 by the grace of the holy and consubstantial trinity and by the prayers of mary our lady the holy and glorious virgin and mother of god
6527592 the queen 17a of mortal man the most holy mother of god
6527593 today he transports from her earthly dwelling as queen of the human race his ever virgin mother from whose womb he the living god took on human form
6527594 the queen of the entire human race faithful to the exact meaning of her name who is exalted above all things save only god himself
6527595 be enthroned lady for it is fitting that you should sit in an exalted place since you are a queen and glorious above all kings
6527596 o my lady my sovereign you who rule over me mother of my lord
6527597 our lady truly and in a proper sense the mother of god
6527598 who is always vigilant to intercede with the king whom she bore
6527599 because the virgin mary was raised to such a lofty dignity as to be the mother of the king of kings it is deservedly and by every right that the church has honored her with the title of queen
6527600 o mother of god today thou art carried into heaven on the chariots of the cherubim the seraphim wait upon thee and the ranks of the heavenly army bow before thee
6527601 o just o most blessed joseph since thou art sprung from a royal line thou hast been chosen from among all mankind to be spouse of the pure queen who in a way which defies description will give birth to jesus the king
6527602 i shall sing a hymn to the mother the queen whom i joyously approach in praise gladly celebrating her wonders in song
6527603 the queen stood at thy right hand in golden vesture surrounded with beauty
6527604 today the virgin mary ascends into heaven rejoice because she reigns with christ forever
6527605 he shall be called the son of the most high and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of david his father and he shall reign in the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there will be no end
6527606 when she became mother of the creator she truly became queen of every creature
6527607 than that christ is our king not only by natural right but also by an acquired right that which he won by the redemption
6527608 near the cross of our lord jesus christ there stood sorrowful the blessed mary queen of heaven and queen of the world
6527609 just as christ because he redeemed us is our lord and king by a special title so the blessed virgin also is our queen on account of the unique manner in which she assisted in our redemption by giving of her own substance by freely offering him for us by her singular desire and petition for and active interest in our salvation
6527610 in order that she might become a partner in the redemption of the human race
6527611 it was she who free of the stain of actual and original sin and ever most closely bound to her son on golgotha offered that son to the eternal father together with the complete sacrifice of her maternal rights and maternal love like a new eve for all the sons of adam stained as they were by his lamentable fall
6527612 what can be more sublime than your joy o virgin mother what more noble than this grace which you alone have received from god
6527613 your honor and dignity surpass the whole of creation your greatness places you above the angels
6527614 limitless is the difference between gods servants and his mother
6527615 showered her with heavenly gifts and graces from the treasury of his divinity so far beyond what he gave to all the angels and saints that she was ever free from the least stain of sin she is so beautiful and perfect and possesses such fullness of innocence and holiness that under god a greater could not be dreamed and only god can comprehend the marvel
6527616 does she approach the problem of our salvation and is solicitous for the whole human race made queen of heaven and earth by the lord exalted above all choirs of angels and saints and standing at the right hand of her only 55a son jesus christ our lord she intercedes powerfully for us with a mothers prayers obtains what she seeks and cannot be refused
6527617 also to illustrate and explain those matters which are contained only in an obscure way and implicitly in the deposit of faith
6527618 exalted to the heavenly throne above the choirs of angels
6527619 look upon the rainbow and bless him that made it surely it is beautiful in its brightness

6527652 if natos priorities move toward reckless support for the georgian president mikheil saakashvilis bankrupt regime and if the price they are ready to pay is to sever relations with russia this is not our choice

6527717 had a lovely time weather 22 26 degrees villa was fab everything you could need travelled all over the place and didnt have to queue once so you were right november was a good time to go will definitely do a return visit possibly at the same time as well
6527718 your place is spot on the weathers still hot in november
6527719 we have had a really good time here the place is great
6527720 trip went as planned it was a nice break in a comfortable villa
6527721 the fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing
6527722 home from home well equipped with everything we could possibly need
6527723 we had an absolutely fantastic time at your beautiful villa it surpassed all our expectations and they were pretty high we loved the position perched up on top of the hill with spectacular views and the house itself was just perfect really comfortable tasteful and exceptionally well equipped beds were super comfy with lovely linen and towels and everything was really high quality
6527724 i didnt see anything of le marche frankly i saw no need to leave the villa
6527725 i wanted to email and tell you what a wonderful time we had staying in your property in italy last week the house was superbly equipped and extremely clean we all loved the swimming pool and the views and tranquility were spectacular we would love to book again for next summer the only difference being this time we would choose to stay for 2 weeks 1 week was just not long enough thank you for providing us with such an outstanding holiday
6527726 our stay was a small taste of heaven thank you
6527727 at the time it wasnt good because a lot of rides had already closed up
6527728 in this sport you get tagged pretty easy obviously if you dont perform well you get pushed out and a lot of that performance is based on the team youre with
6527729 i drove an arca race for rusty and stephen and i have been friends you look at rustys stuff and its all first class you know youve got good equipment i was like yeah well do it it started out just running 15 16 races where the company was at and where were at in owners points we ended up doing more
6527730 say i wouldve stayed with the 40 i probably wouldve been out of a ride this year and nothing against their organization but this year they havent performed that well
6527731 maybe its the best thing that im over here running this a lot of guys have done it
6527732 i knew i had to run good to have a chance at another cup ride
6527733 the other thing is a lot of the guys coming in were open wheel drivers and people that havent had stock car experience it seems like every year someone comes into cup and then gets shuffled out
6527734 i was there two years and i was able to show a lot of improvement with the team i was with we just didnt have the funding they thought they could get it with dario and that didnt happen either
6527735 with rustys program i had to run good weve run really good i judge us off of the richard childress racing cars and off of the independent nationwide teams and we stack right up there with them i feel like we get better and better
6527736 rustys not the type of guy who wants to run bad
6527737 hes going to do everything he can to run good and try to win races thats what i want to surround myself is with good people
6527738 the other thing is ive talked to a lot of veteran drivers who have been around this sport awhile at the time i didnt talk to rusty about it but since driving for him hes been able to help me out a lot i just ask him questions hes mentally helped me quite a bit what ive been going through
6527739 and a very special thanks to those who said this couldnt be done

6527741 tim mcgraw opened up a can of whoop a in washington state this week
6527742 to report from every state in the nation during the 50 days leading up to the presidential election
6527743 tim mcgraw opened up a can of whoop a in washington state this week
6527744 to report from every state in the nation during the 50 days leading up to the presidential election
6527745 obviously hes very excited to be back in the big leagues and to pitch for the club
6527746 his plan and his focus was to make it back this year and obviously he worked extremely hard to put himself in this position
6527747 the reaction has been a little bit more intense than i thought it would be i originally thought that maybe half the country would watch the program but i think in actuality just about all of the country saw us on television we are recognized everywhere we go even in the deep mountain ranges of far east cambodia people know who we are
6527748 we shrugged off their advice for awhile thinking that because we knew khmer we could speak to the gangs and get out of it only a few days later we were filming at the edge of the dump and we noticed a kid about our age looking very shady and staring at our stuff i made a comment about it to todd but we kept filming then a girl came running up and told us that we needed to leave she said that one kid rode off on his bike to get the gang to come back and steal our stuff we listened to her and got out of there pretty quick
6527749 a major theme in the documentary has to do with the contrast between the garbage dump and the provinces the vast majority of the families that work in the dump came there because they had no way to make enough money or food for their families in the provinces thus there is a complex love hate relationship with the provinces and the dump
6527750 once we got off the bus we found ourselves on the banks of a small muddy river on all sides of us there were rice fields cows water buffalo and palm trees we got some cool shots while we waited another two hours for a small long wooden boat to take us on the last leg of the journey
6527751 there were somewhere between 30 50 people staring at us at any given moment during those first couple of hours mumbling to each other and pointing
6527752 i have never seen such a thing in my whole life
6527753 why do they have so much hair on their arms
6527754 on monday night we spent some time crammed into lys small house laughing singing and enjoying each others company all to the light that came from a single kerosene powered lamp
6527755 i think cambodia has affected us all personally in different ways but i think i speak for all of us when i say that it has changed how we find and view happiness in our own lives

6527759 two or three years ago i think the assumption was many if not most people would be upgrading to new generations of laptops and desktop systems much more quickly than they have been
6527760 but the last generation of chips was very very powerful i think powerful enough for the vast majority of the applications most people use
6527761 the history of these sorts of things in terms of how theyll pay off has always been speculative and its been cyclical
6527762 one of the characteristics about seinfeld that gives him credibility in this matter is that hes always been somewhat of a cynic
6527763 hes always been the doubter always questioning the ethics of american society and business we do recognize that hes being paid for this but at least hes got that credibility
6527764 jerry seinfeld is not going to rescue a product that has true problems if its not a competitive product if it continues to dissatisfy the public jerry seinfelds not going to do any good for it
6527765 but if the product starts to get favorable word of mouth theres a synergy i would assume microsoft is looking for synergy here they obviously feel its a good product otherwise they wouldnt be investing this kind of effort in it

6527767 the value of compensation was debatable but government saw that it better that the prior regulation didnt put any compensation at all
6527768 its obviously against the mining in forestry areas law number 19 2004

6527789 this guy right here irrevocably changed so many lives when he chose to arm himself that night
6527790 raul briseno had too much pride to give in to a couple of punks and he chased them out and he paid for it with his life
6527791 the suggestion that no blood transferred onto that jacket and mr houghtaling was so confident that no blood transferred onto it that he wore it into the police station is totally incredible
6527792 the man as i think we all saw is crazy
6527793 thats the crux of the states case and theres nothing there
6527794 he had no motivation to implicate himself in the crime yet he gave specific details
6527795 people all of a sudden realize that the wake of their loved one is going to cost thousands and thousands of dollars and so they walk away from it
6527796 we fully believe every body is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect
6527797 he convinced me his ankle was severely injured so much so that he couldnt bear to let it touch the floor
6527798 of course i took him to the emergency room where they could find absolutely nothing wrong
6527799 and began hoisting the other one as he crawled gingerly across the floor
6527800 this was not only stupid but as i said a disgusting thing to do to children
6527801 a custodian was outside near a dumpster and saw a garbage bag on the outside of the bin that looked like it was carefully placed to stand up a certain way
6527802 there were no threats or letters but they decided to call us anyway and we called the bomb squad since you cant afford to be wrong in something like this
6527803 we think it was basically a dumping incident that had gone awry
6527804 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6527805 this nation was built on a foundation of free speech the first principle of free speech is protected conscience
6527806 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6527807 planned parenthood continues to be concerned that the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6527808 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6527809 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6527810 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
6527811 i t appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests
6527812 can continue to prattle about the virtues of participatory democracy thats so you dont notice that the ruling
6527813 does not care about you or your views the moveon denunciation is an aspect of the performance put on by one part of the ruling class for the benefit of another part they may criticize each other in certain predetermined ways and within certain narrowly circumscribed limits but you may not criticize any of them in ways that go beyond what the ruling class as a whole has decided is acceptable your role and your only role is to vote for them as required and then to shut up almost everyone in the ruling class has identical beliefs but they are usually more adept at hiding them from the unfortunately necessary voters necessary for the moment at any rate but you might wonder arent there any principles at all that deeply matter to them the answer to that is indisputably no there are not with the exception of perhaps two or three members of congress i repeat what i said before the ruling class is not like you and me their concerns are not ours their motivations are not ours their primary and often their sole concern is power achieving it maintaining it and expanding it power thats it thats the whole thing its hardly a secret overwhelming evidence for all these statements and for all the arguments made in my earlier essays lies all around you take off the blinders and look at it what was true of the moveon denunciation is true of our nauseatingly empty election charades in general blinded by the story

6527850 to combat dismal click through rates of traditional social network advertisements these features emulate widgets and encourage users to increase member adoption viral growth and brand interaction

6527870 one day as i was on my way to work i was talking to the lord about my worries god i said what if there was a plane crash and i wasnt there
6527871 he answered my question with a question what if you were there
6527872 i had to laugh at myself what could i do if i was at home and a boeing 727 fell out of the sky stand on the roof and catch it the lord gently reminded me that i have very little control over most things this could be a frightening thought except that god watches over us that day i learned that i am far better off leaving my familys safety in gods hands than worrying about it myself he can control all those things which i cannot
6527873 i am afraid for you lest i have labored for you in vain

6527882 s lo sab amos que ha sido un tr gico accidente y lo m nimo era dedicarle la medalla a las v ctimas y a sus familias el brazalete negro es un s mbolo internacional tan s lo queremos que esa gente que ahora est sufriendo sepa que nosotros que estamos aqu luchando para ganar medallas estamos con ellos
6527883 en nombre de los socios del club y de la junta directiva queremos sumarnos a la dedicatoria que fernando y ant n han realizado desde qingdao china de su medalla de oro que sepan los familiares de la v ctimas que la comunidad de la vela piensa en ellos bajo la alegr a que nos han impregnado nuestros deportistas

6527888 the critics who claimed there would be a mass exodus of nhs dentists under the new contract are being proved wrong

6527890 our goal in designing cruze was to be bold not evolutionary
6527891 we wanted to take a big step forward making a strong design statement for chevrolet products around the world
6527892 we are proud that europe is leading the introduction for this global product
6527893 chevrolet has always stood for expressive value and cruze delivers on that promise like never before it further redefines chevrolet with its design quality materials and great style inside and out the fit and finish for gaps and interfaces sets a new standard for this segment in europe and around the world
6527894 the first factor people notice about the car is the styling its a refreshing and innovative design that is unlike anything else on the market so its totally unique the styling also serves a real technical purpose as its aerodynamic features were designed to aid road holding in terms of driving experience we wanted to ensure no stone was left unturned and we feel the result will appeal to drivers who really want to feel part of the car whether on track or on the road
6527895 weve developed a strong team from design through to production our laminating department for instance consists of craftsmen who honed their skills as part of the luxury yacht building industry for which the local area is famous so the care and exacting standards they integrate into their work and the quality they produce is second to none additionally we plan to bring in local apprentices via an agreement with cornwall college to the automotive engineering industry which brings in fresh thinking which will aid future projects
6527896 i couldnt find the car of my dreams so i decided to build it myself
6527897 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things

6527900 solche krisen die fr her einmal als jahrhundertkrisen galten treten nun jede dekade auf und der steuerzahler muss es ausbaden
6527901 die aktuelle krise wird die us wirtschaft 1 5 billionen dollar kosten und damit mehr wert vernichten als die banken in den vergangenen jahren geschaffen haben
6527902 manchmal sind die kosten der regulierung teurer als ihr nutzen

6527905 what were looking at the moment is the largest number of households in fuel poverty that weve had for the last 10 years or so and we expect something like five million households to be in fuel poverty this winter
6527906 its about 20 percent of all households in the uk and we havent seen that as i say for more than 10 years
6527907 another domino has fallen one after another energy providers are telling customers to brace themselves for an expensive winter
6527908 the brakes have failed on the energy market the results are calamitous
6527909 protection for the poorest effective competition and rational wholesale markets should be limiting the impact on consumers clearly they are doing no such thing
6527910 in the long term government needs to drive a super energy efficiency campaign for new and existing properties the energy market has hard wired fuel poverty into the system government could reverse that by building energy efficiency into the fabric of all our homes
6527911 we have no reports of friendly fire were not sure where these reports started but there is no indication of friendly fire

6527983 por ahora hablar de un viaje del papa en china es totalmente prematuro ha aclarado el padre lombardi si embargo las palabras del obispo li shan manifiestan que todos los cat licos chinos aman y respetan al papa que reconocen su autoridad y que estar an felices de recibirle y esto es ciertamente un aspecto muy positivo y alentador

6528018 rick noriega calls for five debates allowing all texans to hear candidates positions priorities
6528019 has yet to hear from the cornyn campaign about any details dates or even a simple agreement to debate at all
6528020 we welcome the opportunity to debate john cornyn all over texas on the issues that matter and look forward to hearing from cornyn on his failed status quo energy poicies his votes against affordable health care his continued failed policies in iraq and his coziness with washington special interests considering cornyns multiple positions on issues like medicare and the gi bill it might make sense for cornyn to debate himself
6528021 rick noriega repeatedly ran from debate challenges in the democratic primary for fear it would give his lesser known opponent too much publicity
6528022 if i were him id be begging for debates too apparently ricks schedule isnt as full as it was during the primary there will be debates maybe rick could get his buddy fred baron to sponsor one

6528045 hes a quick explosive load in there said coach riley
6528046 hes one of the most important additions to our team without playing a game paea who has amazing strength is part of a brand new front seven
6528047 im anxious to see us play so see where were at said riley
6528048 the problem with this year the ramifications as far as the leagues concerned are right there in front of you right off the bat and i dont really like that but i think the players do and theyre excited about it
6528049 stanford tried to go down the field quite often against us i know jim will want to run the ball also i dont think theyll stay status quo with what they did offensively well see some wrinkles in the first game that we just have to be sound against and adjust to on the sidelines
6528050 the only thing that helps us in guessing what lynn will do is looking at personnel from last year
6528051 a slight edge in consistency and frankly johnny is an all around athlete
6528052 if you watch him he gets tremendous height on the ball said the coach
6528053 its a good group its just that one spot rt is very inexperienced said riley who can only hope that walk on wilder mcandrew thumb one time pre season all america jeremy perry knee and star crossed jc transfer una smiley still feeling effects of that shooting in n
6528054 hes a grinder and when marcus henderson gets well from mono i think well have two good centers
6528055 i really like the fact that i think all of our receivers can threaten defensive backs said riley
6528056 i feel confident in him because ive seen him do it in scrimmages
6528057 i feel really good about those two runners said riley who also wants jc transfer jeremy francis in the mix
6528058 weve got to get him going as a viable third down runner said riley
6528059 hes a quick explosive load in there said riley of the former tongan rugby star
6528060 he looks like he could be one of the better dts that weve had hes one of the most important additions to our team without playing a game

6528062 now when the instance shuts down the data on that volume will persist additionally we can provision and attach multiple volumes to a single instance
6528063 lots of people want to run all sorts of relational databases that run on file systems and block devices

6528072 we think the exposure is minimal but we certainly would not want to risk any of our student information being exposed to a security breach
6528073 even when there is a presumption of confidentiality we dont have that social security number in the mix
6528074 each organization that is hired to do another piece loses the sense of urgency the personal contact and sense of responsibility are gone
6528075 i told you she was good sure hope e remembers us little folks when she makes it big time

6528084 if i could have had the race i had in the semi finals it would have been a closer race
6528085 it was a tough race at the end but sometimes you have to dive in and give it your all
6528086 but fear is not something i bring to the track
6528087 i just have to pick myself up and go forward

6528090 most of the songs are built out of melodies that get stuck in my head
6528091 often those melodies come to me in my sleep i keep a mini disc recorder next to my bed thats full of hums and hoos
6528092 we were paid in pizza and beer best paying show ever
6528093 ive done a good amount of driving through wyoming and other than its amazing landscapes about the only thing that keeps a driver awake are the road signs documenting the names of its creeks dead horse creek and crazy woman creek are two to name a few not knowing the origin of these names is what makes them so notable to me i prefer to leave it that way
6528094 its kind of a fun thing you dont ever get to do in a theater how do we get the set pieces from here to here if we have an audience of 50 how do we get them from here to here and if we have 150 people how is that going to work i think its going to be hilarious
6528095 so she has the journey through the world and the emotional journey of growing up
6528096 normally in theater you stay in one spot and you have wings to put all your stuff
6528097 what were trying to do is have the audience follow us around and trying to do it all with sets we can put in bins and carry around

6528099 this is a great example of what doris can do

6528102 the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental freedom on which our nation was founded
6528103 i am proud to have the endorsement of the nra and buckeye firearms and will continue my work to protect gun owners rights
6528104 as a member of the ohio senate and house of representatives you demonstrated a proven commitment to defense of our second amendment rights through your votes for ohios right to carry law and efforts to stop bogus lawsuits against our domestic gun manufacturers
6528105 the nra pvf urges all nra members gun owners and fellow sportsmen in ohios seventh congressional district to vote for your election to the u s house of representatives
6528106 sometimes all we have is the food that he sends until i get paid for my job and i can buy the things that i need
6528107 the way things are going thank god i have him
6528108 they say they are hungry there is nothing i can do
6528109 id rather be at home making love to my wife while my children are asleep
6528110 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6528111 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6528112 i dont find myself particularly scary or particularly risky but but you know i mean theyre good at it so they got these ads with paris and britney theyve got some guy who just wrote a book hes just making stuff up just make stuff up but it gets a lot of play on fox news
6528113 this could be any location in latviaand any in sweden it is not important since we all are concerned about the energy security of the region the baltic electricity market is common its just that we have to modify the principles of the project so that it could be implemented by all countries perhaps first via the setting up of a joint venture the regional electricity market operator which would take care of energy supply to lithuania latvia estonia and poland
6528114 we cannot lose a single day a single hour in the implementation of this plan otherwise we will come to harm and it would cost us a lot
6528115 id rather be at home making love to my wife while my children are asleep
6528116 he has a close personal relationship with john mccain i dont fully understand why he does
6528117 i told him last night you know joe i cant stand john mccain
6528118 i have a good relationship with joe biden i have great respect for joe
6528119 he was driven into some of the positions hes in because the far left took him on in the primary ive done a lot to protect joe biden

6528123 im sorry i can see you but i cant hear you and even if i could dont even think that i would consider giving up this opportunity
6528124 where soil phosphorous levels are low 10 20 parts per million mehlich iii or bray 1 p or very low less than 10 ppm the likelihood of a wheat yield response to phosphorous is greater than 50 percent
6528125 often the yield response is great enough to more than pay for the phosphorous fertilizer even at today s prices
6528126 it doesn t take much added phosphorous fertilizer with the proper timing and placement to have a big effect on early season development and yields
6528127 early weaning is a cost control strategy that beef producers might consider
6528128 economic damage is almost certain when decision making is delayed
6528129 the decision to wean early for example is most often made when the cow is perilously thin and feed costs are out of control
6528130 all aspects of the nutritional management of early weaned cattle should be geared toward encouraging dry matter intake
6528131 overcoming the reluctance to eat is arguably the most important aspect of weaning management
6528132 early weaned calves are small compared to calves weaned at conventional age
6528133 once a few calves encounter and use bunks and waterers those behaviors will transfer quickly from one individual to another within the pen
6528134 but the real advantage of early weaning is linked to the performance of the cow

6528136 i used to think he was ok but now he seems kind of crazy
6528137 it seems like he used to always complain about negative campaigning and now it seems like hes been doing more of it lately its like there are two mccains
6528138 well thats absolutely true but i blame not mccain but both the media and obama for that mccain early on offered to do town meeting after town meeting with obama obama turned him down so now mccain has to campaign and frankly the media wants to cover the horse race from the medias point of view the ideal presidential campaign looks more like the world wrestling federation then anything else so if mccain wants to get any media attention he has to say negative things about obama its how the system works he hates it he tried to change the rules but he failed in part because the other candidate wouldnt go along meanwhile he does mostly town meetings with his campaigns sometimes at those meetings people stump him because they can talk about anything like i saw him get stumped when someone asked him while medicaid pays viagra but not birth control pills but now hes the one that brings that up
6528139 i can totally see how hes forced into that by the media

6528233 its the first thing that everyone mentions the thing that everyone wants to know about him isnt that peculiar they say but i dont know that it is that peculiar
6528234 a lot of it makes an awful lot of sense and a lot of movie directors that ive worked with work in a similar way
6528235 for instance i never sat down and had a big conversation about my character with christopher nolan he hired me because he thought i could do it he told me i could stand where i want and say what i want and hed shoot it and tell me if it wasnt any good and thats exactly what woody did
6528236 im not trivializing it woody is certainly an eccentric individual but i think theres an awful lot of nonsense thats cooked up around the cult of woody allen
6528237 we got there and we didnt really know what we were going to do with it
6528238 the good thing is that woody shoots all of the exploratory stuff
6528239 because theres nothing worse than doing that thing where you rehearse something and something good happens and then you all sit around and go and that was great wasnt it that thing that happened
6528240 it never works so i appreciate the fact that he shoots all that working out stuff
6528241 and we did it for a long time that scene and we worked it in lots of different ways and we shot it in lots of different ways and i think whats finally there is a mishmash of things that we tried out but it was written so brilliantly that scene that it would have worked anyway
6528242 ive lived in england my whole life but my mothers from detroit
6528243 i essentially can be american as much as i can be english
6528244 its not a light decision at all to go into something that all of your family does for obvious reasons
6528245 and there was definitely a stage where i didnt tell anyone that i wanted to act even though i might have wanted to somewhere deep down my rebellion didnt really amount to much apart from wandering around at family parties and telling everyone i was going to be a painter
6528246 thats the thing if i was going to rebel properly i would have had to have been a banker or a rocket scientist but that side of my brain was not functioning at all
6528247 without wanting to come over all sort of feminist about it its just brilliant to watch a female director because there arent many of them around unfortunately she has a knack of just commanding everyones respect whilst being very witty and brilliant
6528248 its about two neighboring apartments in a building in downtown new york
6528249 catherine keener and her husband oliver platt and their 15 year old daughter live in one and the other one is home to a woman in her 90s who has two grandchildren who are me and amanda peet were sort of caring for her
6528250 when youre a 14 year old and youre fantasizing about where your lifes going to go i sat around fantasizing about playing a particular type of woody allen american heroine in a particular type of romantic bittersweet funny woody allen film
6528251 and suddenly i was sitting there with it in my lap is this really happening its very peculiar
6528252 con la plata que les sacamos sostenemos el tipo de cambio con el que ganan

6528258 you planned it this way all along you came straight over here and left the other guy as a decoy
6528259 theres a whole lot more pressure on retailers to hold back price increases and theres less pressure when prices are coming down so theyre able to expand margins
6528260 the reality is if the retailer didnt start expanding margins right now youre not going to see that station open much longer
6528261 we know better than you do we cant think of any real benefits to being in the eu here are some fluffy words that sound nice the only jobs that are protected are those of the eurocrats we promised you a referendum in our manifesto but we arent going to give it to you

6528267 in the progress of the division of labour the employment of the far greater part of those who live by labour that is of the great body of the people comes to be confined to a few very simple operations frequently to one or two but the understandings of the greater part of men are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments the man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations of which the effects are perhaps always the same or very nearly the same has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur he naturally loses therefore the habit of such exertion and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become the torpor of his mind renders him not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation but of conceiving any generous noble or tender sentiment and consequently of forming any just judgment concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life
6528268 see all this terrible regulation we have to cope with it requires whole departments we have to pay for
6528269 we cant compete with those chinese they dont get paid a living wage
6528270 ok well stick an extra tax on imports from china give you some extra subsidies of taxpayer money
6528271 great now we dont have to worry about containing costs reducing profits improving efficiency and well still be cheaper than the chinese
6528272 the dorset naga chilli is something only absolute connoisseurs of very hot food should even consider trying

6528274 so far ims has mainly been deployed to support fixed line voip services rather than multimedia services likely because ims multimedia services to date have shown varying degrees of success as service providers accelerate their transition to voip to more efficiently compete and as more of them experiment with new mobile and multimedia services ims will be the glue that bridges their heterogeneous networks together and assures standardization of those services

6528292 we cant give people so much security with their income that it affects their willingness to work
6528293 we can have equality in access to education and health but not in equality of income

6528295 perfeccionamiento empresarial has no exact analogy in capitalist economies and is not borrowed from other socialist countries models of reform

6528321 the boat at hope cove is vital because it takes 25 minutes for the lifeboat to get from salcombe and a swimmer could easily drown when the mca withdrew the boat in june they said it would be for six weeks but the crew wanted it back as soon as possible so they paid for the repairs themselves
6528322 they were then told it had to stay off service until it was surveyed and that would have taken it out for the whole of the summer season anyone would have done the same thing when they saw the girl in trouble

6528431 the doubles looking pretty hot just the way they raced
6528432 but then again seeing steven race if he can do that again theyre both good chances

6528553 i was quickest in the warm up but could only go 6th quickest in qualifying
6528554 it would rain really heavily stop and then the track would dry very quickly but how long it would rain for you just couldnt tell we went with the wrong tyre pressures and i couldnt find the right level of grip which meant i dropped back a couple of places
6528555 it had stopped raining again and the track was drying so i was on slicks this made over taking quite challenging because to make a pass you had to come off the dry racing line and go onto the damp greasy parts of the track which made heavy braking quite lairy
6528556 larkhalls one of the shorter tighter and twistier circuits on the calendar and there are always crashes there just after the start its important to avoid the incidents let the race settle and then move forward which is exactly what i did i picked my way one by one and got into second place at this point the leader mark litchfield had established a three second lead but i began to take big chunks out of it and managed to peg it to just over a second at the finish
6528557 the first corner at larkhall is a quick left hander you need to get over to the left as quickly as possible because if you dont youll be hung out to dry on the dirty part of the track
6528558 mark got a good start but i couldnt tuck in behind him because his team mate chris rogers was already there i was pushed wide and got beaten up a little but fought my way back and eventually got into 3rd

6528615 i was born in delaware and have a younger brother whos 29 my family moved to maryland when i was about three years old im fortunate to have parents who have been supportive of anything ive ever tried
6528616 i was in second grade and the first show i did was called mr poppers penguins and i played captain cook who was like main penguin i remember getting a laugh out of people i remember that as being very exciting i didnt have any lines all i had to do was quack but i still made people laugh
6528617 i wasnt frail i was just really skinny i was pretty tall when i was younger too
6528618 it was the first time in my life that i felt comfortable being in front of people
6528619 i really liked it but i was always out in the field looking at the bugs and the flowers rather than waiting for the ball
6528620 number one i was around older people which i liked i thought that was really cool i was the youngest in the cast and everyone else was so much older secondly there was great camaraderie among the cast and i didnt feel there was a competition everyone was working and everyone was winning it was really neat
6528621 we had maybe a 1 200 seat theater and i had never performed in front of a large audience before after tony died i crossed behind the set to the other side of the stage for my bow and i remember hearing clapping and cheering over the intercom and it was an awesome feeling
6528622 well i did all the shows in high school at centennial high school in columbia maryland we had a great drama teacher his name was mo dutterer he knew how to challenge me if something was easy i sometimes had a way of kind of half assing it there was a time when we had to perform a song in my drama class and i sang the music of the night
6528623 she was this petite tough as nails woman with a raspy voice that i can still hear in my head to this day you know there is that one teacher that you think back on and say man she really inspired me well that was mrs norton we were working on scenes from hamlet in her class i did a scene between hamlet and his mother and mrs norton videotaped all of the scenes we worked on in class she took them home and one day she called me up after class and told me that she had shown her husband all the videos and he felt that i really stood out she said that i should really consider pursueing this at some point in my life again i never thought of acting as a career but this instance made me realize how acting could affect the audience i was doing it because i enjoyed doing it not because it was affecting others sadly she passed away from a brain tumor after i graduated college but her voice and enthusiasm always stayed with me and was a motivating factor when i made the decision to pursue this professionally ironically mrs nortons son ed was a few years older than me and he too went on to become a professional actor
6528624 he didnt totally abandon his singing though because in his first year at delaware he founded an all male a capella group called the ychromes and theyre still going strong today
6528625 wed take music off the radio and arrange it for 12 parts and percussion and all that kind of stuff we traveled all over the east coast it was basically my version of a fraternity
6528626 basically performers are given 90 seconds to do their thing and be seen by a whole bunch of institutions
6528627 i did that and was called in to do an opera for children called the emperors new clothes it was a tour sent out by the kennedy center
6528628 because that show was the first big musical id ever seen in baltimore
6528629 the irony is that the guy who played javert when i first saw it back in high school was merwin ford and he was playing javert again in this production and i got to go on for him it was beyond cool
6528630 i initially found myself going into the second production and saying to myself thats not how i did it so i let that go and quickly realized that this was an opportunity to explore the role even more and also to let both my guard and ego down which would allow new things to happen when i played the beast in oklahoma he didnt behave as much like a spoiled child as i played him in the bellport production that came out of experimenting with the role a lot more as well as having done the role before and being comfortable with it oh i definitely brought things with me because there are bits that i knew the audience would find funny
6528631 i talked to ryan gielen a lot about it and we both agreed that there should be some hint of hope for this character so ryan wrote that little scene where i say goodbye to my younger brother

6528638 there might be a minor blip but long term theyll be able to regain that trust and reputation that they may have lost
6528639 theyve been very communicative theyve been really open and honest theyre working really well with the public health authorities theyve taken precedent setting action in terms of shutting down that whole plant to assure the public that they have this bacterium under control
6528640 while the 2007 recall is now largely behind us its impact on our profitability and on our leverage ratios will be felt for some time to come
6528641 theyre acting pretty quickly so the view is theyre trying to be a good corporate citizen
6528642 i think theyve done a lot and now what they should do is say okay now were going to check everything and go through all the steps to make sure this never happens again
6528643 time now is of the essence to make sure they dont lose more than they need to in terms of their reputational capital
6528644 so theyre going to have to get into that plant get it done quickly and reassure the public that its been done in a way that is thorough and effective they know the risks of reputational damage and they cant afford to have this happen again

6528659 now we are asking the public to please help us find caylee now more than ever we are convinced that she was kidnapped
6528660 all this has done has put the tigers in a better position to contend with us
6528661 well i think what was ignored to a large degree is even through the difficulties last year we had a winning record against our division
6528662 if you are saying our division is one of the best then it stands to reason that if we think we match up against our division and if we correct a number of things and balance ourselves out for the long haul then we should be in the thick of it
6528663 thats all we also had nine guys in our starting lineup who achieved below their career levels its not a stretch to think some of them would rebound
6528664 we went into the offseason thinking we had to get our on base percentage better and more consistent and cut down our strikeouts
6528665 we had to play better defensively we had to do better against left handed pitching and hit better with runners in scoring position which would be a natural correction with guys having normal years
6528666 our starting rotation danks and floyd and jose contreras had to do nothing more than what we knew they were capable of doing the bullpen had to support those starters
6528667 thats why i kept talking about balance weve lost a couple of divisions being top heavy in one area or another it looks as though when you have a great offense or great pitching staff but you are lacking in another area those areas become glaring if the talent isnt distributed
6528668 whats happening now is nothing but the result of two things correcting longstanding struggles and mistakes from the past and the players performing
6528669 we have had some real good offensive teams here in the past
6528670 but this is probably the deepest one through nine the deepest group ive coached
6528671 right now in baseball i dont care how many good hitters you have its about pitching
6528672 this team didnt do well last year for whatever reason but they had great starting pitching i had other choices but i signed over here because i knew this team had a chance to be in the playoffs
6528673 they also had a team that could win in their ballpark
6528674 minnesota has a great team but we have to be the team everyone is putting their eyes on
6528675 if each player does what he is supposed to do we will be in good position no question
6528676 we conclude that the companys discriminatory and arbitrary practice unduly squelches the dynamic benefits of an open and accessible internet

6528696 it always helped when we had outstanding players as officers alan page and gene were examples gene was a very powerful proponent of our agenda and really helped to keep the union unified as we won the all important percentage of the gross
6528697 some thought gene was too accommodating its how you get from point a to point b from my perspective when i was running the union we had to win the lawsuits and strike successfully genes view was that once we achieved those goals the owners would never be tempted to break the union again but they did

6528704 nationally prices are probably pretty overvalued by about 10 percent
6528705 further weaken the housing market and prolong the downturn there
6528706 more people out of work is going to put more pressure on people being able to pay their mortgages so thats going to lead to more foreclosures and more people walking away from their houses
6528707 theres no rush for anyone to buy in now or even when we see the signs of a housing bottom
6528708 a better value now than it was a year ago
6528709 still above the historic average which means that houses are expensive relative to apartments
6528710 weve had boomers accumulating multiple housing or rental houses on the expectation that housing was a one way ticket up and that belief has been shattered
6528711 if youre buying to live in a house its probably ok to purchase a house now
6528712 its terrific for his name and it helps us because it brought mark back into the spotlight

6528771 yes well thats a kind word for it for now its mostly a gang of locals with guns hired by the state to protect our natural resources all comes down to economics in the end sir i can assure you that
6528772 youre talking about the railroad going down to iron mountain
6528773 yes sir that is the problem seems as if this border war has poisoned our part of the state
6528774 weve had a hell of a time down there in the last few weeks
6528775 whole family came from kentucky to get free land in kansas territory stopped in ironton three days ago didnt get a half mile out of town before they were attacked every last one of them slain in a most brutal and savage fashion sir even the children
6528776 the next night two of my men guarding the railroad north of ironton were set upon no one knows by whom or what they had taken off for supplies you see both men along with their horses slaughtered and butchered cut up in a most horrible fashion never seen anything like it
6528777 my pardon sir but we believe its the work of these ruffians aligned with atchison couldnt be anything else theyre trying to drive us out of that place
6528778 the owner of this mining operation aloisus creamer has been a solid supporter of the governor and some of the states congressmen for years they got that railroad to go through there but the locals in that area almost to the last man woman and dog are pro slavery and proud of it word has it that they want no government state or otherwise to come in and take their lands tell them which way the sun shines looks like theyve turned ruffian like these others in western missouri decided to take the law into their own hands thats the way we figure it also hurts that mr creamer is an abolitionist dirty word in some parts of this state killing words
6528779 now that whole operation at ironton is slowing down men are getting crazy and fearful and a few have panicked and left
6528780 of course the sheriff of that county as well as my employer want something done about it
6528781 so once again sir what does the governor want with my son
6528782 the governor has ordered me to raise a militia to combat this menace down at iron mountain to protect the citizens and the workers i have about two dozen men so far ill have a dozen more maybe as soon as i can get over to frederickstown
6528783 but your name came up when i asked for someone qualified
6528784 now i know that sir but the governor and other influential people believe i can find no better man for the job than
6528785 he is no soldier he can shoot a gun but so can many other men
6528786 but antoine you are too young your mother will not want you to go
6528787 she will have to understand papa she wont like it anymore than you but she will know that it is for a good cause
6528788 the governor has ordered me to commission you as an officer in this militia i have down at ironton youll be serving under me of course
6528789 but antoine has never served in an army in his life
6528790 neither have many other young men in armies past sir but all the governors best officers even the federal officers are all stationed west near the kansas and nebraska borders and north to st joseph to protect the immigrants we cant spare a soul
6528791 its not so much the duty young sir but the immediate rewards
6528792 they are rather stingy in jefferson city with the pay but its enough to satisfy me
6528793 yes well a man should get his just due even when death is not a part of the bargain
6528794 either way youll be signed lieutenant under me and together well work on this trouble down there
6528795 a few months maybe six at the most depends how long it takes to build that railroad
6528796 there is the matter of albert morris and his sons the trial is the first week of march
6528797 ill see to it that youre there armed to the teeth as well
6528798 im sure it will lend some drama to those proceedings
6528799 i do not wish to put my son in any more danger monsieur
6528800 yes from what happened in that fight today sir i have no doubt that young antoine can handle himself if im not mistaken every fight hes been in the boys been outnumbered
6528801 ride over to her house antoine and invite her to dinner tonight you must say your goodbyes
6528802 he will be ready in the morning monsieur after first mass
6528803 would you care to rest here monsieur your company would be most welcome we will have dinner tonight with my wife in attendance
6528804 before you go antoine i feel i must be honest with you and your father since you have been so kind
6528805 i must warn you about this situation before anything else
6528806 war is imminent good sirs the country is torn in two and it will not stop until the rivers run with blood these ruffians if they are behind this and these slave sympathizers they are not to be taken lightly from my experience as an officer in western missouri where these rebels are at their worst i can only tell you that they are cunning in the field and capable at arms even more so than the soldiers and volunteers they fight against they will stop at nothing not even murder and ambush to defend their beliefs you must be on your guard at all times
6528807 the devil rides in these times sir and we must be brave and resolute
6528808 i think growing up immersed in those experiences played a big part in my lifelong interest in politics
6528809 i remember watching bob dylan a couple of times play late at night in this cafe in dinkytown
6528810 i met a professor who was looking for someone to do computer analysis on the redistricting of legislative districts in minnesota and i jumped at the opportunity
6528811 i was excited to be able to combine statistics and computers things i learned as part of my chemical engineering degree with my interests in public opinion
6528812 we are not commercially based so we dont cut corners like they often do
6528813 they have a tendency to do quickie polls conducted overnight while our research generally carries over a period of several weeks and is much more rigorous
6528814 we got that one wrong but i think more importantly we conducted polling after the election to determine why we got it wrong and hopefully learn something from it
6528815 since 1989 william reisinger vicki hesli from the political science department and i have been carrying out research gauging how public opinion has changed in the former soviet union with the rise of a free market system
6528816 i have friends who were studying chemistry with me and a couple of the guys i know have gone on to create drugs that are fighting the effects of mental illness
6528817 a foo fighters hit from 2003 comes off as a message from an intellectual and experienced man rather than a preachy message from an old man who has nothing left to his name
6528818 originally by velvet underground is more of a personal lament from a man who has gone through so much in his life that all he has left to do is try to find his proper place in the way of prayer almost as if it is the last thing he has yet to accomplish and has been able to support himself up until this point
6528819 i might not know what i am but i know what im not i know where i stand i know where im not gon drop and thats at the feet of another man defeat at the hands of either my enemies or friends i dont put it past either to wanna see me weaker than them either kill me or jail me hate me fuck it im here to bring something more to this rap shit here to extend the middle finger of my black fist and if that puts me at risk then let it happen you can only fear what you imagine
6528820 i dont necessarily believe in god but i believe in a higher power
6528821 im a porno flick im amazin grace im gonna fuck some hoes after i rock this place
6528822 i feel like we are caught in a catch 22 militarily and globally and i follow the stories of whats going on and how it affects our soldiers
6528823 one of the things that i chose was to make it as non period specific as possible
6528824 its very much about war in general especially the more modern wars like vietnam or world war ii
6528825 when i went to broadway a couple years ago i was trying to figure out whats the quality that makes this elevated and to be honest its clarity and speed broadway shows go at the speed of light
6528826 our regular actors are starting to develop that speed and precision
6528827 its very cinematic the play is very jumpy much like the book events are organized in a much more linear fashion but it still jumps most of the time there are two characters on the stage sometimes four
6528828 the really great thing about this production is that i have extraordinary talent
6528829 i cast it in may before everybody had summer plans i got people interested worked around their schedules weve got a cast of amazing talent
6528830 i applaud the iraqis for wanting to take greater control of their country and security our soldiers continue to serve honorably completing missions even in the shadow of washingtons failures we must begin a strategic redeployment and bring them home safely securely and soon
6528831 as a nation we must refocus on the looming national security threats in afghanistan and pakistan
6528832 it will be up to the next president and the next congress to enforce any agreements put together during the bush administration it will be necessary to send voices to washington that have a firm understanding of what it takes to end the war in iraq and reform our national security policies

6528841 guidate dalla cricca del dalai lama e condotte da una minoranza scontenta e da criminali incalliti
6528842 se davvero si vuole conoscere il tibet non bisogna documentarsi sui blog ma con approfondite ricerche sul campo dice allagenzia italia tenzin ganpa vicedirettore del centro creato 23 anni fa e finanziato dal governo di pechino
6528843 ha diversi canali per conoscere gli umori e i desideri della popolazione ma esprimerli con i disordini non e ammissibile in nessuna parte del mondo in occidente si dice che la gente manifesta perche non e contenta delle condizioni di vita ma le nostre ricerche dimostrano che non e cosi l80 per cento della popolazione non vuole saperne dellindipendenza dalla cina perche per ogni 10 yuan un euro ndr investiti in tibet 9 vengono dal governo centrale sarebbe assurdo se i tibetani volessero vivere con il 10 per cento di quello che hanno adesso e rinunciare a privilegi come quello di una casa piu grande di quella che puo permettersi una famiglia media di pechino grazie al progetto di edilizia popolare che e stato avviato a lhasa anche tra gli esuli pochi sono a favore dellindipendenza e prova ne e che molti sono tornati per investire nella loro madrepatria le ricchezze accumulate allestero
6528844 in origine la parola indipendenza neppure compariva nel vocabolario tibetano
6528845 e il titolo stesso di dalai lama deriva da una tradizione di patriottismo che egli ha tradito non si puo paragonare quello che il dalai lama dice alla situazione reale egli manca dal tibet da 50 anni e la regione si e completamente trasformata perch non da ascolto a quello che al popolazione locale vuole oggi
6528846 non e stata una manifestazione spontanea ma organizzata con largo anticipo
6528847 i manifestanti tra i quali cerano molti pregiudicati per reati gravi hanno usato oggetti che non si trovano per le strade di lhasa e che sono stati evidentemente portati con uno scopo i giovani che coinvolti hanno poi ammesso di essere stati convinti a lasciarsi andare alle violenze anche coloro che hanno disturbato la marcia della torcia sono poche centinaia di indipendentisti che non godono del sostegno di nessuno

6528861 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6528862 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6528863 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6528864 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6528865 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6528866 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6528867 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6528868 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6528869 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6528870 and some people dont have cars and some people dont mind living on almost nothing
6528871 we have the best coffee on the planet we have bob marley and now we have usain bolt we are overjoyed and overwhelmed
6528872 i would love to see even more athletes involved in speaking out about what they believe in the problem is that even if there was an athlete that wanted to speak out on issues of human rights he might be silenced by whatever ioc official is mediating that press event with a bogus explanation that is my biggest problem with these olympics the idea that the games are only about sport
6528873 every time the chinese government has gone back on guarantees of free speech free access for the media and a number of the other issues the ioc has acquiesced
6528874 done many amazing things and for that they deserve a lot of credit
6528875 however these games still would have been as successful without what appears to be massive suppression of any voice that the government doesnt want heard
6528876 this haircut is from this morning i cant directly say why i did it its connected with certain things that the olympic charter forbids but i will say that its symbolic
6528877 go down with a terribly mixed legacy this morning the chinese government sentenced two women who are nearly 80 years old to a year each in reeducation camp because they filed for permits to officially protest the destruction of their homes at an official olympic demonstration site
6528878 ive been on tnt for years and no ones ever asked me who won the championship in greece last year
6528879 we had no problems with the questions or the answers as depicted in the piece
6528880 the way they are taking over the west they are doing it culturally inch by inch they dont need to fire one bullet
6528881 is not opposed to islam in any way just against the terrifying islam extremism
6528882 i think it is the decision with the biggest economic implications for the nation that weve ever had to make
6528883 milestone in chinas rising international status and a historical event in the great renaissance of the chinese nation
6528884 its been a while since ive seen er me ugh this is going to be so confusing then again i remember being confused when you met me like youre meeting me right now
6528885 see there i go again confusing things oh i forgot youre supposed to say
6528886 right look we dont have much time because when you write about this in your blog and you will you dont want it to go on too long so lets skip ahead to the part where i explain that im you from the future
6528887 one year into the future to be exact i travelled here to tell you that your 27th year is going to be one hell of a year i just had my 28th birthday party crazy fucking time man those french know how to party
6528888 yes as in from france it was totally a surprise anne was filming in france invited me down and boom surprise birthday craziness
6528889 sure its a bit down the road from here but hmm i probably shouldnt say anymore you know how it is when someone knows too much about their own future blah blah blah
6528890 how is that even possible i couldnt even get a date on match com
6528891 yeah turns out a large percentage of the profiles on match were fake profiles designed to lure customers in but when you try to talk to them nothing
6528892 yeah you get a nice chunk of change from that
6528893 the new iphone it has a flux capacitor feature which makes time travel possible it costs a hell of a love money too wait till you see that phone bill
6528894 oh the hair another feature from the um iphone its a damn good product
6528895 time travel new hair and anne hathaway all of this in a
6528896 its one hell of a year i have to warn you though i got a visit from 29 year old me and apparently my 28th year isnt so great
6528897 because another boat crashes into it killing the entire cast of gossip girl who were having a party onboard
6528898 yeah 29 year old me told me to make sure that i keep plenty of sensitive explosives on my boat to make sure the explosion is adequate enough upon collision
6528899 hmm looks like im running out of my pre paid time travel minutes ill be leaving here soon
6528900 whoa no touchie time paradox and all that plus i like my personal space
6528901 i just wanted to ask why did you come here
6528902 i remember this being a particularly grueling year there were good times
6528903 wait till you go back the second time oh man you
6528904 well youll see future stuff anyway there were many bad times as well and i just wanted to come by and tell you itll all work out i remember i appreciated hearing this when i was you
6528905 oh yeah youll want to know this abby becomes a meth whore and alyssa disappears during her trip through europe never to be seen or heard from again i figured the info would help bring closure for you i know it did for me
6528906 i still need to do something about that bitterness hey he didnt tell me whatever happens with my cute neighbor
6528907 is it girl girl guy or guy guy girl girl girl guy or guy guy girl
6528908 the most common form plaque psoriasis appears as raised red patches or lesions covered with a silvery white buildup of dead skin cells called scale
6528909 it seems that psoriasis is most common in caucasians and slightly less common in african americans worldwide psoriasis is most common in scandinavia and other parts of northern
6528910 no special blood tests or diagnostic tools exist to diagnose psoriasis the physician or other health care provider usually examines the affected skin and decides if it is from psoriasis less often the physician examines a piece of skin biopsy under the microscope
6528911 w e have found it necessary to terminate your employment with discovery place inc as part of a reduction in force rif the personnel decisions which the company has had to make have been difficult but in our best judgement are absolutely necessary
6528912 why oh why is the poor boy up there making a fool of himself if he dont even claim to be an artist

6528918 i was pushing myself up against the wall when the bombing started next couple of days i spent in the basement
6528919 we used to have a jewish neighbourhood which was one of the most authentic and historical streets in the city
6528920 the genocide was committed against civilians of south ossetia regardless of their ethnicity
6528921 this was a big game because it was a semifinal in the olympics said hammon who had little impact on the game in her 24 minutes on the floor
6528922 this was a game that was bigger than me and that whole fiasco
6528923 rocky played after the anthems and russian fans who vastly outnumbered the tiny pockets of american supporters were in no mood for sportsmanship
6528924 rossiya as their team seized an early five point lead
6528925 we were rushing a little bit on offense and not taking care of the basketball said u
6528926 we hung our hat on our defense and we knew if we got a little bit of a run and got a cushion wed maintain it
6528927 un american a remark widely attributed to her and said she would greet hammon when she next saw her
6528928 i dont know that i have strong thoughts on it any more she said
6528929 becky made a great business decision this was a great opportunity for her to get to the olympics i hold no grudge
6528930 what ive learned since my first strong statement is that im an old timer generations have changed and the cold war is a distant memory if its a memory at all for our players our players are going to russia to play chinese players are coming to the wnba there are no borders any more
6528931 before i didnt have the time to bathe jacqueline every day nor did i understand the importance of keeping jacqueline washed and well groomed now i have learned the importance of hygiene so i make sure she is clean before going to the nursery
6528932 i even feel a responsibility to inform other parents about the importance of hygiene when i see that their children are dirty
6528933 now teachers get together each month to create lesson plans we do it collaboratively to get advice from one another
6528934 in the classroom communication between teachers and students has improved and you can see that students are more confident as a result
6528935 there are many parents in this community who cant read and write
6528936 when children drop out of school its almost always for economic reasons because their parents need them to work
6528937 if you are not educated you cannot find good work
6528938 i didnt have the chance to go to school but i dont want my daughters to have to work from four in the morning until sundown on a farm like i do i want them to have something better if they dont want to go to class i talk to them about what the problem is
6528939 when students are out of school for three of four days we teachers visit their homes to talk with the parents and see what the problem is
6528940 altogether parents are more involved in the school now they help us with rehabilitation projects and organize recreational activities for the children we also have a group of mothers who cook lunch everyday for students
6528941 for me the projects biggest contributions have been increasing retention rates and motivating students to be leaders at school and within the community
6528942 lettuce is calming and beneficial to anyone suffering from insomnia
6528943 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6528944 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
6528945 and whichever way it bounces thats the way sports is
6528946 you win the silver medal but youre the team that lost a game
6528947 you have 10 minutes to kind of digest that and get up there and put on a pretty face i mean its hard most of the time im pretty good at putting on a face but its hard
6528948 its an amazing thing to have an olympic medal but we had the game we had it in our grasp and we let it go
6528949 i will prosper in all things and be in health just as my soul prospers
6528950 this makes the team medal all the sweeter its going to take a while for the moment to sink in
6528951 i felt it a few strides before that he wasnt strong
6528952 i didnt think it was an option so thanks to him
6528953 from what we hear on the ground here in chicago theres something big erupting relating to these papers baipa and the sudden odd retirement of state senate president emile jones soetorobamas mentor and ladder to his us senate seat

6528968 we are pleased that an agreement has been reached we wanted to avoid any disruption in care for our patients and have been committed to finding a solution that allows us to make appropriate investments so we can continue to provide exceptional patient care and service
6528969 we had many good and thoughtful discussions that helped us develop a mutually acceptable contract
6528970 we know that our members and customers will be pleased we reached an agreement that keeps fairview providers and facilities in our contracted network and also that we were able to make progress in keeping health care more affordable
6528971 there was a lot of hard work and time spent in creating the agreement and both parties worked diligently to assure that patients and members had uninterrupted care and coverage
6528972 it jumped to about 30 this year so far in three months weve seen about 30
6528973 i continue to be concerned about the tri border area between argentina brazil and paraguay
6528974 it is in my view principally hezbollah activity there is clearly fund raising money laundering drug trafficking and certainly a portion of the funds that are raised in that are making their way back to the middle east
6528975 this has been done to ensure that students are held accountable for their actions and that the school does everything possible to ensure the safety of all students both at school and while travelling to and from school
6528976 its a dilemma its a hard decision and certainly the outcome is not decided
6528977 it is imperative that new zealand s emissions trading scheme is passed into law this parliamentary term
6528978 this is very much a case of something being better than nothing the climate is in crisis and new zealand has virtually no policy in place to start addressing it
6528979 the national partys calls for the scheme to be delayed are irresponsible and must be ignored
6528980 they are based on nothing more than the bleating of a core group of big polluting businesses
6528981 our message to the green party is that we need an emissions trading scheme but not this one

6528985 the reason so many cartoonists are now working for television is that that is where the money is from movie exhibitors couldnt afford to pay enough for cartoons because of the double feature and all but working for theatrical cartoons i worked much less i wrote eight cartoon features a year since ive been working for television ive done in seven months about eight years worth of stories this medium eats the stuff up
6528986 ive been in the cartoon business for 25 years and ive been in every department
6528987 in filling the schedule they were forced to work out a technique of animation that would be faster actually faster than that used in theatrical cartoons
6528988 the gags that red skelton throws away we would never throw away were footage misers as a boy i was a great fan of the silent pictures in 1913 i saw chaplin and i came alive
6528989 i went home and i made up as chaplin there isnt a film of his i havent seen over and over he showed me how close humor is to tragedy and the original mark of zorro with douglas fairbanks with its chases and its humor depended very much on the sort of action and pace cartoons have now im going to draw quick draw as zorro one day
6528990 no one can take the credit for the finished product one hand washes the other the beautiful part of animated cartoons is that even though we may all hate each other everyone is working for the same thing you cant tell where one animator leaves off and the other begins no i dont mind the anonymity we animators are a sort of exclusive club and none of us would want to do anything else
6528991 this is the first government report to present definitive conclusions that number one tobacco advertising and promotion are causally related to increased tobacco use in the population
6528992 and number two it shows that depictions of smoking in movies is causally related to youth smoking initiation
6528993 any promotional technique that lowers the price the kids see when they go to buy a pack of cigarettes is extremely important
6528994 the report speaks clearly to what amounts to an assault on the nations health
6528995 love you send this to all the people you care for most and see how many you get back 1 3 unloved 4 6 liked 7 9 loved 10 deeply loved
6528996 if theyre eating something thats glowing in the dark bio luminescent prey then the darkness on the inside of the mantle shields the light from going outside and exposing the squid to a predator such as a sperm whale
6528997 but we know they are not eating fish with light organs but juvenile colossal squid do have two little light organs under their eyes
6528998 it looks like she is brooding many many thousands of tiny colossal squid inside her mantle and the darkness will shield the light
6528999 my research suggests theyre not the t rex of the sea they get more docile as they mature a strange phenomenon that has caught scientists off guard
6529000 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
6529001 her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine
6529002 its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting
6529003 the shortfalls in the operations grant must be addressed so skilled and valued support staff are retained in every school
6529004 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw

6529035 dealing with the safety and security of biological resources as well as ensuring that all those involved in relevant activities are aware of the international regional and national measures which regulate their activities and the principles that underpin them will go a long way towards ensuring that we continue to enjoy the benefits of biotechnology while being shielded from its dangers
6529036 addressing these issues will require continued engagement with the scientific medical commercial and educational communities
6529037 we need to develop a coordinated approach to the prevention of the misuse of biological science and technology and i am determined to ensure that all these actors are actively involved in the bwc work programme

6529043 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands squad for the after careful consideration
6529044 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6529045 i decided to retire from englands odi team for a number reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family
6529046 now that my family is settled and my bowling is settled i feel i have something to offer englands odi side and am looking forward to playing a part in the natwest series against
6529047 having missed out on selection at various times this year i am well aware of the disappointment that comes from not being a part of the england dressing room
6529048 with that in mind i want to be a part of the team and if that means bringing myself out of retirement to play a role in this upcoming natwest series then im happy to do just that

6529065 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6529066 this nation was built on a foundation of free speech the first principle of free speech is protected conscience
6529067 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6529068 planned parenthood continues to be concerned that the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6529069 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6529070 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6529071 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
6529072 there are going to be more write downs i dont think anybody out there is expecting otherwise
6529073 the good news is that the market is starting to separate the financials from everything else every time financials go down doesnt have to be a reason for everything to go down
6529074 those stocks have been pounded when they consolidated i think you had a lot of shorts that were willing to cover
6529075 people were saying to themselves lets not get too greedy here
6529076 we formed oz minerals to pursue growth and we can identify a number of tangible opportunities including both the development of projects in our pipeline and potential acquisitions
6529077 the market would have responded positively to a signal by the company to buy back some shares at a depressed price which would have supported its comments about the long term robustness of the business
6529078 oz minerals has said it is pursing acquisitions but the market is concerned about the current management strategy adding value to any acquisitions it may make
6529079 our message to the market is we have put together a platform of growth and will focus on expansion

6529090 change in beneficiary policy will help you simplify your planning
6529091 warning unless you act were about to change who gets your individual retirement accounts when you die
6529092 change in beneficiary policy will help you simplify your planning
6529093 i dont see how they can change the beneficiaries on your accounts without your consent
6529094 because the cost is suffered by the benchmark index itself it will remain hidden from index investors who simply focus on the explicit fees of index funds and their performance relative to the index yet it represents an unambiguous drag on returns and it can be avoided with simple index neutral strategies which have otherwise similar risk and return characteristics
6529095 the gips standards are a set of standardized industry wide ethical principles that provide investment firms with guidance on how to calculate and report their investment results to prospective clients
6529096 i favor the pristine and classic all u s stock market and all bond market approach
6529097 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged
6529098 the three factor model is as fama and french have repeatedly emphasized only a model it is not reality
6529099 i never attempt to make money on the stock market i buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years
6529100 unless you can watch your stock holding decline by 50 without becoming panic stricken you should not be in the stock market
6529101 unless you can watch your stock holding decline by 50 without becoming panic stricken you should not be in the stock market
6529102 i came to think of this part of obamas agenda as the virginia model thanks to tim kaine virginias governor who was one of the first democrats to endorse obama
6529103 for much of the 20th century virginia was a poor state but after world war ii with the cold war under way and the military growing well paying defense contractors began to sprout up around the pentagon in northern virginia
6529104 iacs revenue model is simplified focused on online advertising subscription and lead generation
6529105 its capital structure has also changed with cash and equivalents of 1 3 billion and long term debt of just 80 million
6529106 i assume these acquisitions will be a little more tied together thematically
6529107 really early in his presidential campaign when i got the opportunity to listen intently to his ideas and his platforms i immediately said this is beyond belief
6529108 i joined the effort and it became clear to me that i was better able to work in my community in a broad way and support this outstanding candidate as a democrat
6529109 if its going to be a close election it could be a huge factor
6529110 youre going to see some turnout like youve never seen before in the state of florida
6529111 my goal here is that african americans who have voted democratic their entire lives will begin to at least consider a republican candidate
6529112 and then ill move to the second goal of registration but it is a slow process
6529113 its a funny thing about obama but when i see him speak and see him on the stage i dont see him as a black man i just see a man he symbolizes hope and we surely need hope
6529114 i have a lot of problems with the way this loan was written

6529122 hindi safe yang peace negotiation isang activity yan na kung wala kang prinsipyo at tatag ng loob di mo papasukin yan kung titignan mo ang peace negotiation mga litrato sa formalidad ng pag uusap
6529123 kasi pag nakita mo na sa peace negotiations na brutal ang kaharap mo to gain an advantage papatay ng marami sa pilipinas di ba tinigil ang peace negotiations sinasabi ng philippine government sa ndf na kayo pwede kayong lahat malagay sa terrorist list at ang cpp npa at si sison na lalagay sa terrorist list eh hindi pwedeng tanggalin yan hanggang mag surrender kayo so ganyan ang pressure meron silang gusting kabigin sa ndf hindi lang namumuksa sa karapatang magsalita kundi me gusto silang hilahin sa ndf yung capitulation in effect and the pacification of the revolutionary forces and people in the philippines
6529124 kung minsan naka amerikana kurbata tapos me pa toasting toasting pa ng baso tapos mamaya eh dinecide ng malacanang na palabasin na enjoy na enjoy ka sa europe nagpapasarap ka habang naghihirap ang mga tao sa pilipinas ayun lalabas sa peryodiko gagamiting pangintriga
6529125 there are occasions where you have to be formal you have to appear like everyone else ang masaklap mag ooplan laya sila titirahin nila yung malaking bilang ng masa sa kanayunan papatay sila ng legal at walang armas na aktibista tapos ipapakulong kami dito gagambalain kami dito yan ang brutal na magagawa ng nasa kabila ng peace negotiation
6529126 a look into the complaints submitted to the joint monitoring committee 4 june 2004 to 31 december 2007
6529127 ang mga kasong filed sa ndf eh higit sa 96 eh nuisance complaints wala man lang supporting documents basta nilagay lang shot to death shot to death paano iimbistigahan yan tapos aside from that merong duplication tapos mismong si philip alston eh nagsasabi na paano maiimbestigahan eh wala namang detalye tapos me 42 incidents na hindi naman nakapaloob sa carhill samantalang yung mga kasong filed sa kanila on human rights violations eh talagang documented
6529128 ayaw mangyari ng ndf na puros exploratory talks nalang yan ganyan ang panlolokong ginawa ng grp sa milf nung 2001 informal talks ng informal talks lang sila pero when the time came to formalize agreements eh wala maganit gusto lagi ng philippines government na palitan yung nakapagkasunduan umabot sa moa na nauudlot yung signing at ayaw namin na ganon ang mangyari yung ginawa sa milf puros exploratory informal talks at sinasabayan ng ceasefire
6529129 nung lumaki ang kamay ng militar diyan sa panahon ni gloria ang diwa ng grp eh manloko sa ndfp yung di niya makamit sa battlefield gusto niyang kamtin across the table gusto niyang talunin gusto niya igulid ang ndf sa agreement na makakasira sa kilusang revolutionaryo
6529130 from negotiations our focus shall shift to dialogue with the communities or government conducting authentic conversations or dialogues with the people the focus of our talks shall shift from armed groups to the community the parameters governing our negotiations shall be a balance between constitutionality and public sentiment
6529131 our engagements with all armed groups shall be about disarmament demobilization and rehabilitation
6529132 we cant afford to give john mccain the chance to serve out george bushs third term
6529133 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
6529134 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6529135 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
6529136 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to george bush
6529137 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6529138 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6529139 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6529140 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base
6529141 at the start of the election cycle the republican party was pretty dispirited after the 2006 election and in many cases that remains true today
6529142 i think the producers try to match up people who might make headlines romance possibilities it is all part of their cunning plan

6529165 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6529166 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6529211 you for example are highly critical of israel without demonstrating even the slightest inclination toward anti jewish sentiment
6529212 to get power you need to display absolute pettiness to exercise power you need to show true greatness
6529213 america is still the no 1 killer in the world we are deeply involved in the importing of drugs the exporting of guns and the training of professional killers we bombed cambodia iraq and nicaragua killing women and children while trying to get public opinion turned against castro and ghadhafi we put nelson mandela in prison and supported apartheid the whole 27 years he was there we believe in white supremacy and black inferiority and believe it more than we believe in god
6529214 you for example are highly critical of israel without demonstrating even the slightest inclination toward anti jewish sentiment
6529215 its like the smithsonian you could be here for weeks and not see everything

6529219 we believe it tells the story in a more accurate and compelling way by conserving them
6529220 its the first thing that everyone mentions the thing that everyone wants to know about him isnt that peculiar they say but i dont know that it is that peculiar
6529221 a lot of it makes an awful lot of sense and a lot of movie directors that ive worked with work in a similar way
6529222 for instance i never sat down and had a big conversation about my character with christopher nolan he hired me because he thought i could do it he told me i could stand where i want and say what i want and hed shoot it and tell me if it wasnt any good and thats exactly what woody did
6529223 im not trivializing it woody is certainly an eccentric individual but i think theres an awful lot of nonsense thats cooked up around the cult of woody allen
6529224 we got there and we didnt really know what we were going to do with it
6529225 the good thing is that woody shoots all of the exploratory stuff
6529226 because theres nothing worse than doing that thing where you rehearse something and something good happens and then you all sit around and go and that was great wasnt it that thing that happened
6529227 it never works so i appreciate the fact that he shoots all that working out stuff
6529228 and we did it for a long time that scene and we worked it in lots of different ways and we shot it in lots of different ways and i think whats finally there is a mishmash of things that we tried out but it was written so brilliantly that scene that it would have worked anyway
6529229 its the first thing that everyone mentions the thing that everyone wants to know about him isnt that peculiar they say but i dont know that it is that peculiar
6529230 a lot of it makes an awful lot of sense and a lot of movie directors that ive worked with work in a similar way
6529231 for instance i never sat down and had a big conversation about my character with christopher nolan he hired me because he thought i could do it he told me i could stand where i want and say what i want and hed shoot it and tell me if it wasnt any good and thats exactly what woody did

6529239 he skelemani said they had been misinformed and were of the opinion that tsvangirai should accept the agreement that president mbeki had facilitated as it was quite reasonable his exact words were what more does tsvangirai expect but we cannot order him to accept the agreement all we can do is try and persuade him to see sense
6529240 which step that should receive the most emphasis from policy makers
6529241 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
6529242 give us everything so we dont have to choose and surely one of them will have to work

6529244 the poor economic conditions have created a very different and difficult dynamic for us this year and we werent confident that we could present a show experience that was consistent with the successes of prior years

6529248 has never taken a human life by his own hands
6529249 was outside the building in a car at the time of the murder
6529250 at reneaus trial the prosecution had argued that reneau was the person chiefly responsible for the crime and that woods role was secondary
6529251 wood was involved in the robbery in this case because of his longstanding mental illness that allowed him to be easily manipulated by the principal actor daniel reneau
6529252 executing someone who didnt kill violates the most basic principles of justice
6529253 if a person is only mentally ill and not incompetent the decisions are less clear and are up to individual judgments by the governor or the jury
6529254 it is awkward and quite strange to see states force inmates to take medication so they can be killed but this is the hateful nature of our capital punishment system
6529255 it has very little to do with logic and certainly nothing to do with compassion
6529256 and you have a situation that the rest of the world views with shock and incomprehension
6529257 its a pretty traditional criminal law that accomplices and co conspirators are equally held culpable
6529258 you dont have to specifically agree to commit a killing you agree to commit the target crime then any other crimes that are foreseeable youre responsible
6529259 flies in the face of a broader effort to reserve the death penalty for extreme cases
6529260 they argued clearly and unambiguously that reneau was the bad actor
6529261 then after getting the death sentence at woods trial they essentially conflated the two men they argued that they were in this together
6529262 save his life stop abuses on prisoners and abolish the death penalty starting from the united states of america
6529263 we are convinced the inquiry and trial that led to reginald being sentenced to death reveal an abuse of the law errors of form and procedural flaws
6529264 reginald is african american he was a street kid and a member of a gang he belonged to a world that the us institutions and texas in particular fight with such rigor it often becomes prejudice we suspect
6529265 the verdict contains elements of racial discrimination and this is confirmed by the fact that reginald blanton was not judged according to his constitutional rights by a jury of his peers the district attorney also arranged it so that the entire jury was made up of white americans and it is for this reason that the 5th circuit court of appeals recognized this violation of his assurance of a fair trial
6529266 reginald blanton was sentenced on evidence given by unreliable witnesses extorted under grave threats from his brother robert members of a gang him too and to the latters girlfriend even if they withdraw their charges in front of the court
6529267 the climate of intolerance and prejudice has inexplicably brought to a guilt verdict this in the bargain in spite of the fact that there was no eye witness able to identify the culprit no murder weapon has never been found there were no reginalds fingerprints or traces of his dna into the victims apartment moreover
6529268 we are able to demonstrate an incredible sequence of errors and violations of human rights in reginald blantons case
6529269 and we are convinced the us judicial system which still makes use of the death penalty too often makes legal errors and procedural flaws the law decides whether a human being should live or die with a margin of error that is inevitably high and often linked to social and personal bias as well as to the defendants previous record and race all this in defiance of article 11 of the universal declaration of human rights we ask ourselves how many other innocent people will be put to death by the executioner before the death penalty is abolished and a respect of life is re established
6529270 because we are convinced that many innocent people have been put to death those in power often want to set a example in an attempt to fight crime but when institutional revenge puts an innocent person to death it makes a martyr of him and in that moment democracy civilization and humanity are transformed into cruelty injustice and brutality

6529295 running paid search programs has an impact on organic search results we have seen this clearly in our research
6529296 without the ability to measure these interactions advertisers may be limiting performance by underutilizing ads that increase the number of organic clicks while running other ads that shift traffic from organic search results to paid search results similarly advertisers may be missing significant investment opportunities to further leverage their paid search programs in areas where seo is underperforming not just on a traffic basis but on a value creation basis our goal has been to develop metrics like the search synergy score that measure these effects and provide advertisers with recommendations on how to deploy spending to ensure maximum performance
6529297 as a covario client were excited to see the company leverage its powerful analytics platform capabilities to help advertisers manage interactive advertising with full visibility into the impact of strategy changes on various forms of digital media
6529298 we continue to seek more effective ways to monetize investments in our search programs and one of the most underserved aspects of the advertising market today is the availability of operational systems that allow advertisers to see the impact of changes in strategy in one advertising channel like paid search on another advertising channel like organic search

6529328 above any other money saving strategy consumers use specials in store flyers to determine where they shop with the majority of consumers trying to make fewer trips to fewer stores its more important than ever for grocers to capture every possible visit
6529329 retailers with customer purchasing data from their loyalty programs can really use it to their advantage by picking the right products and providing the right incentives to attract customers to their stores versus competitors
6529330 also despite the challenging economy consumers are very reluctant to switch brands to save money thats a factor that reinforces grocers critical need to understand which brands are most important to their customers
6529331 retailers who use data from their most important customers to determine new product opportunities and to identify which brands to promote and which to give the most in store presence will have a significant advantage

6529345 it is imperative that new zealands emissions trading scheme is passed into law this parliamentary term
6529346 this is very much a case of something being better than nothing the climate is in crisis and new zealand has virtually no policy in place to start addressing it
6529347 the national partys calls for the scheme to be delayed are irresponsible and must be ignored
6529348 they are based on nothing more than the bleating of a core group of big polluting businesses
6529349 our message to the green party is that we need an emissions trading scheme but not this one
6529350 if theyre eating something thats glowing in the dark bio luminescent prey then the darkness on the inside of the mantle shields the light from going outside and exposing the squid to a predator such as a sperm whale
6529351 but we know they are not eating fish with light organs but juvenile colossal squid do have two little light organs under their eyes
6529352 it looks like she is brooding many many thousands of tiny colossal squid inside her mantle and the darkness will shield the light
6529353 my research suggests theyre not the t rex of the sea they get more docile as they mature a strange phenomenon that has caught scientists off guard
6529354 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
6529355 her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine
6529356 its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting

6529373 there is nothing around their home intended to prevent the occasional entry by a stranger onto their driveway there is no gate no keep out sign nor guard dog standing watch
6529374 the journalist would want to talk to their lawyer before they do that
6529375 i wouldnt be comfortable saying dont worry about it because there is aerial photography
6529376 the court system is often very protective of peoples rights to keep people off their land
6529377 google like any other member of the public was privileged to briefly drive up plaintiffs driveway
6529378 turning around in a private driveway while photographing the exterior of a home is not a substantial intrusion
6529379 its something we have to come to grips with the tension between new technology and privacy
6529380 residents who want images removed must contact google through an online form found in its street view help section
6529381 we have alot of money so we can do whatever we want

6529388 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
6529389 this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform

6529505 being sued over intellectual property is not uncommon at all
6529506 it happens on a fairly regular basis sometimes its a genuine issue over patent disputes other times the plaintiff may want to force a company to come to some kind of licensing agreement sometimes they just want to get money from a large company
6529507 its not uncommon to see lawsuits filed against companies with a large amount of equity
6529508 it allowed you to move your arm in a three dimensional space with a controller in your hand so you could control an interface on the television this was before the nintendo ever launched the wii so its possible the lawsuit has merit

6529515 latin america and the caribbean have a tremendous social gap we need to find technological solutions to connect remote regions at accessible prices for users we need to guarantee universal accessibility to telecommunications services

6529517 i believe mass adoption will start to take place within two or three years since we need to increase coverage as well brazil should grow its broadband penetration with mobile services to more than 10 of the population which is still a low figure

6529529 it looks very nice and wide with a smooth surface it also looks like good fun track but we wont really know until tomorrow as there is big difference between walking a track and driving it at almost 300 km h learning a new track to start with is not too difficult and just takes a few laps to find out which way the corners go but after that you continue to learn small details about it i dont find it too hard to deal with a new track the only place i found any bumps is where the track goes over a bridge and theres one in the middle of a corner that might have an effect but apart from that it looks like the people here have done a very good job
6529530 of course i would have liked to have won more races but the opportunities were sometimes missed
6529531 but i am still in a good position in the championship and while the season so far could have been better it could also have gone the other way and been a lot worse i am hoping we get some good results for the remaining races to get back to where we should be the main issue has been getting stuck behind other drivers in the race after having had a bad qualifying session if we can sort that out we should be fine coming up now are some circuits that i really like we have good speed in our package and the important thing is to make sure we use that speed in qualifying because that is the crucial point of the weekend getting the car to work the way i want is just a matter of some very small things but thats enough to make the difference some times we get it right but unfortunately we seem to have got it wrong more often so far now we have found a solution that helps to make the car a bit easier to drive in qualifying even though it looks as though you can overtake here it is still very important to try and start from the front but in general i am not worried about the rest of the season the pressure is always there but at the moment it is not getting bigger as the championship gets nearer the end then there will be maybe more pressure not to make any mistakes
6529532 the team suffered but they played with a lot of will in front of an amazing public
6529533 it was a hard fought triumph but mexico were clearly the superior team
6529534 we played better than the hondurans but had no luck we surely will have more in the next game

6529547 some of the very large boats are so bad if you are sitting on your balcony or patio and they go by on the other side of the lake youll have to stop your conversation because you cant hear its that loud
6529548 its an issue for a huge number of people the website basically says we are asking the fine be drastically increased and at a second offence the boat be impounded and not allowed back in the water until the exhaust is permanently fixed
6529549 as i understand it it only adds about a 5 increase so if people werent allowed to do it it isnt going to have any appreciable effect on the enjoyment of the boat
6529550 the fine is just 115 a lot of those boats spend that much on gas in an hour so its not a significant fine as far they are concerned the rcmp do their best but they dont have the resources to enforce properly
6529551 we also have to realize that these things have been sitting in the water for the past 50 years so its not like were introducing them to a foreign body
6529552 the prime concern would appear to be a little bit of turbidity as they land on the bottom of the lake i suspect that we do far more damage to okanagan lake with our milfoil program than will be done by these pontoons

6529554 i want to encourage people in this community who may not normally think that they have the time to run for council to reconsider
6529555 i think its important that we have people from all walks of life and that includes people who have businesses who are busy and think they are too busy for council we have people sitting at this table who have jobs who run multiple businesses and still have time to make a contribution to their community
6529556 my greatest concern is we have a good representation of our community and not just people who are looking for jobs if you need a job and you cant find one then this isnt what you should be doing
6529557 anybody running for council has to understand that youre an independent person and you stand up and make all kinds of promises and criticisms of the current council and how much better you would do let me tell you its not as easy as you think it is
6529558 ive listened especially in the last week to a lot of innuendo about this council a lot of mean spirited nasty things have been said in the last week and it bothers me because there isnt one person sitting around this council table that is mean spirited that doesnt care deeply about this community and doesnt think long and hard about the decision that get made
6529559 to the people that ive served with here for three years and we sure dont always agree i have enjoyed working with each and every one of you and disagreeing with each and every one of you

6529562 die den kl gern in der ladung zur m ndlichen verhandlung angegebenen lageberichte des ausw rtigen amts vom 6 mai 8 juni und 13 juli 1998 lassen einen r ckschlu auf eine gruppenverfolgung ethnischer albaner aus dem kosovo nicht zu nicht einmal eine regionale gruppenverfolgung die allen ethnischer albanern aus einem bestimmten teilgebiet des kosovo gilt l t sich mit hinreichender sicherheit feststellen das gewaltsame vorgehen des jugoslawischen milit rs und der polizei seit febrauar 1998 bezog sich auf separatistische aktivit ten und ist kein beleg f r eine verfolgung der gesamten ethnischen gruppe der albaner aus dem kosovo oder einem teilgebiet desselben es handelte sich bei den jugoslawischen gewaltaktionen und gewaltexzessen seit februar 1998 um ein selektives gewaltsames vorgehen gegen die milit rische untergrundbewegung insbesondere der uck und deren umfeld in deren operationsgebieten ein staatliches verfolgungsprogramm das sich auf die gesamte ethnische gruppe der albaner bezieht besteht nach wie vor nicht
6529563 die dem senat vorliegenden erkenntnisse stimmen darin berein da die zeitweise bef rchtete humanit re katastrophe f r die albanische zivilbev lkerung nach dem abflauen der k mpfe im anschlu an die ende 1998 mit der serbischen f hrung getroffene bereinkunft lagebericht serbien des ausw rtigen amtes vom 18 11 199 abgewendet werden konnte und da sich seitdem sowohl die sicherheitslage wie auch die lebensbedingungen der albanisch st mmigen bev lkerung sp rbar gebessert haben namentlich in den gr eren st dten verl uft das ffentliche leben zwischenzeitlich wieder in relativ normalen bahnen vgl hierzu ausw rtiges amt vom 12 1 1999 an vg trier vom 28 12 1998 an ovg l neburg und vom 23 12 1998 an vgh kassel auch wenn sich die spannungen zwischen den bev lkerungsgruppen auf grund einzelner gewalttaten zwischenzeitlich erh ht haben auch einzelne f lle exzessiver gewalttaten gegen die zivilbev lkerung die wie etwa in racak in der welt ffentlichkeit der serbischen seite zur last gelegt werden anmerkung eka dies hat sich inzwischen als falsch erwiesen und gro e emp rung ausgel st hatte lassen nach zahl und h ufigkeit derartiger exze taten unter den gegebenen umst nden nicht den schlu zu da deshalb jeder im kosovo lebende albaner mit beachtlicher wahrscheinlichkeit einer extremen gefahr f r leib und leben ausgesetzt ist und mithin auch jeder r ckkehrer von tod und schwersten verletzungen bedroht sei
6529564 f r ein geheimes programm oder einen auf serbischer seite vorhandenen stillschweigenden konsens das albanische volk zu vernichten zu vertreiben oder sonst in der vorstehend beschriebenen extremen weise zu verfolgen liegen keine hinreichend sicheren anhaltspunkte vor wenn die serbische staatsmacht ihre gesetze durchsetzt und dadurch zwangsl ufig druck auf die sich vom staat abkehrende und eine boykotthaltung einnehmende albanische volksgruppe aus bt geht die objektive zielrichtung dieser ma nahmen eben nicht auf eine programmatische verfolgung dieser bev lkerungsgruppe selbst wenn der serbische staat wohlwollend in kauf nimmt oder gar beabsichtigt da ein teil der b rger der in einer solchen situation f r sich keine perspektiven sieht oder zwangsma nahmen entgegen will ins ausland ausweicht stellt dies kein auf die gesamtheit der albanischen bev lkerungsmehrheit im kosovo zielendes verfolgungsprogramm dar
6529565 wenn im brigen der jugoslawische staat auf die separatismusbestrebungen mit konsequenter und harter durchf hrung der gesetze sowie mit antiseparatistischen ma nahmen reagiert denen sich ein teil der betroffenen ins ausland entzieht ist dies kein vom jugoslawischen staat programmatisch gesteuerter vorgang der auf die ausgrenzung und vertreibung der minderheit abzielt sondern im gegenteil auf ein sicheinf gen dieses volkes in den staatsverband
6529566 auch die ereignisse seit februar m rz 1998 lassen ein verfolgungsprogramm wegen albanischer volkszugeh rigkeit nicht erkennen die ma nahmen der bewaffneten serbischen kr fte sind in erster linie auf die bek mpfung der uck und deren vermutete anh nger und unterst tzer gerichtet

6529575 were excited about bringing christine to campus so her southern miss family can celebrate her achievement
6529576 as she carries the banner for the state at the miss america pageant she also represents the university and were extremely proud of that fact
6529577 this celebration is an opportunity for us to wish her well and shes excited about it
6529578 christine is going to be a wonderful representative of our state and our university
6529579 i think its important that we are out there meeting the students and letting them know that counselors are here to talk
6529580 i also think its important to get rid of the stigma of counseling and to give faces to the counselors
6529581 our purpose with this event is to let students know we offer a lot of different activities for those who want to be active and competitive to those who want to exercise on their own individually
6529582 this is a part of their university experience and a great way for us to welcome students to our campus
6529583 as a transfer student who has no idea where theyre going anyway its nice to know people are there to help
6529584 i really didnt think it was artistic and i taught art for nine years
6529585 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
6529586 more and more students and their parents are recognizing the uniqueness of southern miss that it is a comprehensive university but yet a place where students can still get personal attention
6529587 we have stellar degree programs talented faculty small class sizes and a friendly caring and energetic campus community located in a great city its the perfect combination
6529588 these students come to us with exceptional academic records a record of service to their communities and great leadership skills
6529589 its one of the most positive and spirited groups of freshmen ive encountered at the university
6529590 theyve come in understanding whats expected of them inside and outside of the classroom and they understand what it means to be a golden eagle
6529591 we hope weve helped inspire them to believe in themselves get involved in campus life and reach for their goals
6529592 it helped me get acquainted with the university and plan out my degree program
6529593 friday night at the fountain is a great event on friday nights
6529594 but the team with the game preparation they just dont have the opportunity to really experience that so thats what were trying to create with this festivalival idea this sunday night

6529596 i feel blessed that hes on and helps lead this football team
6529597 ive found that this offense is an easier one to run and talking to other guys they feel the same way but we have to communicate
6529598 dont worry were going to be running the ball just as much as were going to be throwing it
6529599 right now weve got some guys banged up like calvin wilson is out right now

6529635 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6529636 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6529637 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

6529687 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

6529749 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6529750 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6529751 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6529752 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6529759 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6529760 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6529761 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6529762 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6529763 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6529764 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6529765 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6529766 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6529767 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6529768 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6529774 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras

6529793 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6529794 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6529795 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6529796 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6529797 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6529798 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6529799 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6529800 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6529801 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6529802 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6529803 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6529804 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6529805 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

6529816 if people get down there on the floor and want to start blowing kazoos and making a scene we want to make sure weve got people who stand in front of them with obama signs
6529817 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6529818 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6529819 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6529820 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6529821 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6529822 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6529823 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6529824 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6529825 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6529826 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6529827 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6529828 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6529829 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6529830 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6529831 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6529832 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6529833 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6529834 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6529835 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6529836 customers point of view people can pretend like theyre there to chit chat and all that but what people really want is traffic so why not give it to them
6529837 can i also sit like you and do nothing all day long
6529838 interventions that have been created to encourage abstinence have treated abstinence and sexual activity as opposites however teenagers say they dont think of them as opposites
6529839 these abstinence only interventions are less likely to work than more comprehensive sex education programs because they are not meeting adolescents where they are and they are speaking a different language
6529840 this paper demonstrates that increasing abstinence intention does not lead to less sex in fact when abstinence intention and sex intention interact with each other a teenager is more likely to have sex

6529842 most people do not think that young people have strokes
6529843 but the point people should really understand is that they can occur in utero they can occur in the neonatal period and they can occur in older children there are noticeable differences in presentation risk factors and the prognosis in children compared to older adults however
6529844 people are like kids dont have strokes so i still think theres a lot of work to be done in terms of awareness
6529845 the evidence is overwhelming that there is a specialized system dedicated to processing faces and not other objects
6529846 why we are so good at recognizing and remembering faces
6529847 a brief glance at a face conveys a wealth of information about identity expression gender age mood intent attractiveness social states and even honesty
6529848 the ability to extract this information within a fraction of a second of viewing a face is important for normal social interaction and has probably played a critical role in the survival of our primate ancestors
6529849 are completely baffled why robbers cover their faces in movies
6529850 its like viewing grains of sugar rather than the whole cube
6529851 a region could serve more than one function said scott huettel a professor of psychiatry at duke university in durham n c
6529852 just by looking at an fmri we can tell if a subject is looking at faces or places

6529857 i knew yesterday but i thought i would give you one more normal day
6529858 to be in love with a country or a political regime is a tricky business you get your heart broken even more surely than by being in love with a person you may even lose your life i knew a woman political activist in the old days in this case the 1950s she spent her days and her nights working to undo the white regime in south africa needing a rest she went to visit nigeria to see her dream made flesh found it was run by human beings and committed suicide everyone who has been involved with idealistic rhetorical politics knows a thousand versions of this story from all over the world
6529859 were delighted to have a real estate debate with barack obama
6529860 its a frickin mansion he doesnt tell people that you have a mansion you bought in a shady deal with a convicted felon
6529861 you are going to see more of that now that this issue has been joined youll see more of the rezko matter from us
6529862 the reality is they have some investment properties and stuff its not as if he lives in ten houses thats just not the case
6529863 the reality is they have four that actually could be considered houses they could use
6529864 i dont live in my seven houses i just live in four the rest are investments
6529865 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6529866 if i am elected in november no inner city child will have to live in an america where george bush is president
6529867 no senior citizen will lie awake at night worrying about whether george bush is still the chief executive of this country and no american regardless of gender regardless of class regardless of race will be represented by george bush in the world community
6529868 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6529869 every sentence from mccains campaign contains a noun a verb and pow
6529870 i really dont know how many houses ive got but all them furriners oughta be shot
6529871 in terms of whos an elitist i think people have made a judgment that john mccain is not an arugula eating pointy headed professor type based on his life story
6529872 if you can dazzle them with brilliance confuse them with bs
6529873 the reality is they have some investment properties and stuff its not as if he lives in ten houses thats just not the case
6529874 the reality is they have four that actually could be considered houses they could use
6529875 are not only aimed at enthusiasts of the genre but can bring delight to all audiences
6529876 can bring to the big screen throughout the country events that in real life only take place in specific places for a limited time
6529877 since the apple soho store moved in six years ago it has become the worst neighbour in soho
6529878 no bar nightclub or construction site comes close to ruining continually our quality of life like apple soho has
6529879 this concert attracted thousands of young teenage girls who screamed incessantly on the street for hours for their idols blocking traffic injuring one resident in the crush and inconveniencing scores of other people and businesses
6529880 flood lights on the roof often kept on all night glaring into peoples homes
6529881 crowds for apple soho on a regular basis that necessitate police barricades adding to pedestrian crowding preventing access to high end businesses on greene street and subsequent diminution of income as well as restricting residents access to their homes
6529882 subsequent litter left by these crowds who often number in the hundreds and who line up and even camp out overnight on public sidewalks giving soho the appearance of a homeless encampment
6529883 apple employees during their breaks lounging eating smoking littering in effect trespassing on nearby peoples stoops
6529884 residents and businesses of soho desperately need your help regarding constant problems we have with apple soho
6529885 representatives of states were asked to gather concrete evidence against these fronts so that these can be banned like their parent body simi
6529886 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6529887 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6529888 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6529889 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6529890 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6529891 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6529892 i really dont know how many houses ive got but all them furriners oughta be shot
6529893 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6529894 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6529895 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6529896 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6529897 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6529898 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6529899 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6529900 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6529901 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6529902 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6529903 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6529904 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6529905 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6529906 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6529907 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6529908 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6529909 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6529910 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6529911 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6529912 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6529913 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6529914 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6529915 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6529916 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6529917 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6529918 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6529919 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6529920 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6529921 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6529922 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6529923 hopefully it will be really soon heard it on the news and went yahoo maybe ill get back on the rock again things are looking brighter than when we left in 95 so hopefully things will make a turn newfoundland will be like alberta someday
6529924 we have two cars we never had two cars in newfoundland we have money when we want it we take a vacation
6529925 theres more people at a montreal canadiens home game than there is in the whole of williams lake
6529926 i took a few trips down to vernon ive been team roping with bobby lewis its fun
6529927 i go in there every morning and work out my goalie coach is there too eli wilson hes the ottawa goalie coach after the workout we go and skate with him for two hours
6529928 i skate with a whole bunch of other pros jason labarbera hes from prince george and plays for the kings chris mason was there he plays with nashville kevin nastiuk hes in the carolina system jeff glass he was the world junior goalie before me hes in the ottawa system linden rowat who plays for regina was out there too
6529929 you have to shake off the rust a little bit the first three ice times i felt like i didnt know what i was doing out there you give it a week or two and you start to feel normal again
6529930 during the summer i stay away from carbohydrates and try to stay away from pastas and bread especially white bread i have a whole wheat bagel in the mornings before my workout
6529931 thats what i like about anahim lake you can go fishing right in our back yard in corkscrew creek pull out a couple of trout and fry those up for dinner
6529932 i picked up quite a bit but im not fluent in it yet
6529933 i hang around with the younger french guys like lapierre and latendresse
6529934 its a lot of fun its definitely the best place to play when youre playing hockey the montreal fans really get into it as soon as we get to camp theres a buzz around the city especially this year being the centennial year it should be a lot of fun
6529935 i didnt know if i was going to make the team at the start of camp i had a good year the year before i just came to camp hoping id make the team then bob gainey decided to keep me there then i went through a slump right around christmas things werent going too well so i went down to hamilton i was still struggling a little bit for two weeks then during the second half of my month long stint in hamilton it started to pick up again they brought me back to montreal and everything started to roll from there and things started going really well then they traded chris huet to washington and it was like getting tossed into the fire
6529936 when the trade deadline came and passed everybody kind of relaxed a little bit we all knew this was our team for the rest of the year it took all the pressure off and we started to play really well we went on a pretty good roll there from the trade deadline to the end of the year
6529937 we did well against them all year we took it to them for the first couple of games and then they started playing well and it kind of seesawed back and forth and we won the seventh game
6529938 we just couldnt get any breaks we must have hit two posts a game thats just the way it went it was fun though especially in the playoffs
6529939 everybodys going that much harder eighty two games is a long year its a lot of games when you hit about 72 games you just want to get the regular season over with you want to get into a groove right before the playoffs and get it over with
6529940 i have a helmet on when im playing but every once in a while you have someone who recognizes you a bit but other than that not really
6529941 i dont think much about it im a guy who just runs with everything whatever happens happens
6529942 he scored on me but i stopped him on a breakaway we had a pretty good chuckle over that one
6529943 i think we need a little veteran presence theres just me and yaro 21 and 23 years old that was it there was just us two young guys and i think bob gainey figured to bring in somebody a little bit older to have around the room
6529944 youve got to show up in camp in the best shape possible im starting to feel pretty good now but youve got to keep pushing yourself all the way to camp
6529945 meanwhile my trainer sends me something to do every day usually it takes me two and a half hours to get through a workout running doing the elliptical riding the bike doing weights with your legs upper body core a whole bunch of core workouts to do
6529946 you dont come to training camp to get into shape any more youve got to come to training camp in shape its a little different than it used to be
6529947 you miss it after a while during the off season youre gone from the game for four or five months and you start to miss it
6529948 you go strolling with cowboy boots on and everybody looks at you funny
6529949 i was thinking to myself did i order something from ebay off the internet i didnt recall ordering anything from tennessee i opened it up and it was a stetson box inside was a signed stetson from garth brooks and a note saying carey thanks for keeping the faith pal garth brooks that was pretty cool
6529950 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6529951 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6529952 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6529953 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6529954 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6529955 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6529956 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6529957 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6529958 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6529959 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6529960 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6529961 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6529962 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6529963 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6529964 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6529965 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6529966 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6529967 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6529968 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6529969 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6529970 the bottom line is that airgun noise from seismic surveys that are thousands of yards distant does not drive away sperm whales living in the gulf
6529971 however some individual whales feeding at depth reduced the rate at which they searched acoustically for their prey when scientists carried out controlled exposure experiments by bringing seismic surveys close by the whales as a result the oil and gas industry has agreed to a best practice attitude that seismic surveys should shut down temporarily when towed airguns come within one third of a mile of whales or groups of whales in the gulf
6529972 sperm whales go to where their food source is and that means very deep water so folks that do see them are marine mammal observers who ride the seismic survey vessels and the workers on the big oil and gas rigs and even that does not happen often
6529973 we now know that the sperm whales in the gulf appear to be their own distinct stock they show genetic and social differences from other sperm whales around the world
