6750074 sesungguhnya jika tuhanku tidak memberi petunjuk kepadaku pastilah aku termasuk orang yang sesat
6750075 hai kaumku sesungguhnya aku berlepas diri dari apa yang kamu persekutukan sesungguhnya aku menghadapkan diriku kepada rabb yang menciptakan langit dan bumi dengan cenderung kepada agama yang benar dan aku bukanlah termasuk orang orang yang mempersekutukan tuhan qs 6 76 79 beranjak dari defenisi rukyat ini maka dalam kaitannya dengan proses penentuan awal bulan baru pada penanggalan islam hijriah berartikan sebagai melihat dengan mata kepala lahiriah akan status visibilitas hilal atau penampakan bulan sabit dilangit secara langsung termasuk menggunakan teleskop bintang maupun teropong biasa kelemahan utama dari sistem rukyat ini ada pada keterbatasan mata inderawi kita terhadap halangan halangan yang bisa timbul dilangit saat pengamatan seperti cuaca mendung hingga penglihatan tertutup awan hitam ketinggian tempat pengamatan waktu dan lain sebagainya permasalahan klasik tersebut sudah disadari juga oleh rasulullah saw sehingga kemudian beliau bersabda berpuasalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal bulan sabit dan berbukalah karena melihatnya jika kalian terhalang awan maka sempurnakanlah syaban tiga puluh hari
6750076 janganlah kalian mendahului bulan ramadhan dengan puasa satu atau dua hari kecuali seseorang diantara kalian yang biasa berpuasa padanya dan janganlah kalian berbuka sampai melihatnya hilal syawal jika ia hilal terhalang awan maka sempurnakanlah bilangan tiga puluh hari kemudian berbukalah iedul fithri dan satu bulan itu 29 hari
6750077 apabila datang bulan ramadhan maka berpuasalah 30 hari kecuali sebelum itu kalian melihat hilal
6750078 berpuasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya jika awan menghalangi kalian sempurnakanlah tiga puluh hari jika dua orang saksi mempersaksikan penampakan hilal maka berpuasalah dan berbukalah kalian karenanya
6750079 sesungguhnya kami ini umat yang ummi tidak pandai menulis dan tidak pandai menghitung perjalanan bulan bulan itu ada yang begini begini dan begini dikurangi beliau dengan ibu jari pada kali yang ketiga 29 dan bulan itu ada yang begini begini dan begini 30
6750080 dan orang yang berpijak pada hisab dalam menentukan hilal sebagaimana ia sesat dalam syariat iapun telah berbuat bidah dalam agama dia telah salah dalam hal akal dan ilmu hisab
6750081 manusia sedang melihat lihat munculnya hilal aku beritahukan kepada nabi saw bahwa aku melihatnya maka beliau berpuasa dan memerintahkan manusia untuk berpuasa
6750082 dan apabila dikatakan kepada mereka ikutilah apa yang diturunkan oleh allah mereka menjawab tidak tetapi kami dapati dari perbuatan nenek moyang kami apakah mereka akan mengikuti juga walaupun nenek moyang mereka tidak mengikuti suatu apapun dan tidak mendapat petunjuk
6750083 bulan ramadhan bulan yang di dalamnya diturunkan permulaan sebagai petunjuk bagi manusia dan penjelasan penjelasan mengenai petunjuk itu dan pembeda haq dan batil
6750084 dan telah kami tetapkan bagi bulan garis edarnya sehingga setelah dia sampai ketitik edar tertentu kembalilah dia sebagai bentuk tandan yang tua
6750085 sesungguhnya kami ini segolongan umat yang ummi kami tidak pandai menulis dan tidak bisa menghitung sebulan itu ada yang begini dan begini yaitu kadang kadang 29 hari dan kadang kadang 30 hari
6750086 kalau misalnya hiduplah nabi kita muhammad saw dijaman kita ini agaknya akan beliau suruhkanlah bilal bin rabah melakukan azan dengan memakai loadspeaker dan mikrofon akan beliau suruhkan agaknya muaz bin djabal menyebarkan islam ke negeri yaman bahkan keseluruh dunia dengan memakai radio
6750087 perintah berpuasa sesudah melihat bulan dengan mata kepala adalah lil irsyad bukan lil idjab yaitu melihat bulan dengan mata kepala hanyalah salah satu jalan memulai puasa tetapi bukan satu satunya jalan ini hanya jalan yang ditempuh oleh umat yang belum pandai berhisab karenanya sangat menggelikan hati kalau orang berpuasa yang fanatik kepada lahir perintah terus menetapkan bahwa dialah rukyat bil fili satu satunya jalan buat memulai puasa
6750088 sebenarnya bulan itu dua puluh sembilan hari maka janganlah kamu berpuasa sampai kamu melihat bulan dan janganlah kamu berbuka sampai kamu melihatnya
6750089 lalu kami tentukan bentuknya maka kami lah sebaik baik yang menentukan

6750108 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it

6750116 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defence aimed at russia
6750117 the purpose of missile defence is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
6750118 we are here to take up the fight against russia
6750119 contrary to the official version presented by prime minister tusk and the us state department the war in georgia played a key role in accelerating the polish american negotiations on the defence shield it is the war that has prompted tusk to give the go ahead for the signing of the agreement
6750120 the fact that the us ruled out this compromise proposal permits only one conclusion that the missile shield is directed first and foremost not against iran but against russia this is underlined by the fact that the other bases for the missile system are also located in border regions to russia for example alaska
6750121 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow is capable of launching following an american first strike
6750122 the missile system is therefore a crucial element in the attempt to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for the stationing of just ten interceptor missiles in poland but once the system is established their number could be easily increased
6750123 this article makes very clear the actual function of the missile system it is to guarantee the us the capacity to carry out nuclear war without the risk of a counter strike if this capacity can be achieved then it can be employed as a geopolitical argument in order to implement national interests
6750124 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent

6750149 guardi che loperatore verso cui ha deciso di spostarsi solo un operatore virtuale non bello e fico come il nostro e bla bla bla e yada yada uaz
6750150 se non cambia operatore le abbassiamo un pochino la tariffa per x tempo e
6750151 mmm allora potremmo anche abbassare di un pochino il costo dei messaggi
6750152 hemm allora potremmo anche abbuonarle pochieuro di telefonate al mese
6750153 ho sentito che ha parlato con una mia collega ma non ha cambiato idea e yada yada e bla bla bla e vorremmo sapere perch
6750154 quindi non ho tempo da perdere e voglio cambiare operatore non ne posso pi dei disservizi e delle misteriose continue strategiche cadute delle chiamate con scatto alla risposta e
6750155 scusi ma a noi non risultano i disservizi vedo che le sue chiamate sono per x e y e ogni tanto per z
6750156 e non capisco per le faccio unaltra offerta dimezziamo le tariffe voce e sms e le carichiamo xx euro al mese
6750157 veramente io ho chiamato il 4916 per sapere il mio credito zzovuoi tu
6750158 si si ok vabb andiamo al sodo perch ne ho gi le scatole piene
6750159 uh ok ci risulta che lei vuole cambiare operatore ma yada yada e bla bla bla e noi saremmo in grado di
6750160 eh ah dicevo siccome questa cosa mi dispiace tantissimo vorrei sapere quali sono i motivi
6750161 quindi ho preso una decisione non solo sulla base del problema economico ma anche etico
6750162 allora le faccio una super stra fantastica sfavillante illuminante proposta che non pu rifiutare le abbasso la tariffa di 3 centesimi al minuto e
6750163 ma allora la terribile temibile tipa di ieri era laltra numerazione quella che ha fatto un sacco di stor ehmm cose strane
6750164 eccomi stava dicendo la mia collega che lei intenzionato a cambiare operatore come e per gli stessi motivi dellaltro numero
6750165 e che lamentate disservizi vari e yada e bla e bla se vuole possiamo fare la stessa offerta che abbiamo fatto allaltro numero anche a te
6750166 e mi pare il minimo poi sinceramente non capisco con che criterio del cappero fate le offerte tentatrici per evitare il cambio operatore prepara il gatorade
6750167 ok allora mi sono ritrovato con delle offerte da pezzente nonostante spenda pi dellaltro numero e il fatto che sono cliente da molto pi tempo lo so che probabilmente non tua la responsabilit di certe scelte ma
6750168 si in effetti non mia competenza e confidenzialmente bla bla e yada yada censur e bla e proprio non capisco nemmeno io caro gentilissimo
6750169 no guarda ormai mi sento tradito sei stata gentile e tentatrice ma ho deciso
6750170 ti giuro che fino a poco fa non avrei mai nemmeno lontanamente immaginato di cedere alle tentaz hemm offerte e che avrei cambiato comunque ma siccome
6750171 ah ok vado dal supermegabossipergalattico e chiedo se posso fare una cosa del genere in effetti sei cliente da tanto tempo e bla bla e ci sentiamo fra
6750172 vi chiederanno se questo uno dei motivi rispondete pure sinceramente e se vi fanno presente che tutti gli altri operatori lo faranno voi mentite pure spudoratamente sapendo di mentire dicendo che vi conviene comunque cambiare se passate a postemobile o ad altri operatori minori infatti non si tratta nemmeno di una bugia vero
6750173 we also have been working with some of their key software providers to port some of the applications that they have internally natively onto force com for them to use
6750174 and all of that together suddenly we were one of their key technology vendors and it really gave them the ability to sign what we call an enterprise license agreement with us
6750175 having a big hitter commit to developing on force com is really important
6750176 previously those committing have tended to be saas smb players like centive or xactly or midmarket on premise apps vendors looking to get saasy quickly like coda
6750177 talked proudly about not needing to rely on a third party vendors erp but creating its own apps
6750178 so i wonder if that might be a possibility as well as the ability to tailor salesforce crm more to the needs of its sales reps
6750179 you let tim omundson talk before me because hell just talk
6750180 oh okay well if its on there why are you asking me
6750181 i can catch the four oclock or i can catch the seven thirty and im done at five i can go

6750183 we dont know we dont pretend to know we just kind of like ride it hang on and go
6750184 there was one guy coming over to me to try to tackle me and i laughed when i looked over to the right and i saw drew like pointing at the gap pointing at the guy who was about to tackle him and he ran into the end zone
6750185 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6750186 following those discussions we have agreed in principal to consider other alternative sites and ways that we can mutually overcome those obstacles
6750187 we are committed to continuing those discussions while preserving our rights to the south columbus boulevard site
6750188 we told them we have no cash that day when i offered 30 million is gone they probably should have grabbed it
6750189 given the experience that foxwoods already experienced the last thing they want to do is go out of the frying pan into the fire and go to a more horrendous community problem

6750195 american diplomatic personnel are unable to get through the checkpoints but the french ambassador eric fournier is so he stepped up to the plate and we are grateful that he went to their house put the kids in the car put the uncle in the car and drove back from chirtora
6750196 i stuck in gori they take everything clothes money everything they take everything they like and say ok you can go back so we stuck again there and they stopped my car so they start to shoot and we have to run in the woods and leave car there and take 30 miles to walk through the woods
6750197 when the french ambassadors car came into the american embassy the doors opened up the kids got out and did a sprint to their dad and he likewise did the same to them and it really was an emotional moment they couldnt have hugged him any tighter

6750200 high draft picks that through injuries or bad coaching development inability to handle pressure went on to suck
6750201 despite conversations about eco overload sustainability is in a nascent stage especially in the minds of consumers
6750202 in 2008 the top brands in the us were the ones that you put on or in your body and in the uk the places where you buy those type of products
6750203 despite consumers high interest in cutting energy consumption the brands with real potential to reduce energy usage though high in the green rankings could still do a better job of connecting to peoples energy saving impulses more directly more personally doing that would take those brands green ness to the next level of consumer relevance
6750204 most of the executives argued the approach would cost too much and it would be undermined by ges many superfund sites

6750211 i think it is important that people not have to go to baton rouge to tell me their concerns

6750214 as a teacher i would have liked for him to have come to the schools and spoken to the teachers and the support staff
6750215 lots of people are saying this club resemble chelsea and i believe the situation looks like what happened there
6750216 they are one of the best teams in the world and hopefully qpr can be a new chelsea
6750217 playing for the best team in the world which is real madrid is every players aim but you never know where you are going to end up
6750218 if i cant make it there i would be delighted to succeed in the premier league
6750219 my personal objective is to become a better player a better person as its an adventure year for me the lads have been great with me very welcoming as soon as i arrived
6750220 i love english football they live it in another way the fans are great and the stadiums are full even if its second division games

6750224 if they dont allow forks on airplanes anymore they shouldnt allow them on the floor of the democratic convention
6750225 i came to help the mayor get started and put together the mayors team
6750226 i have my own career i didnt want to leave that either
6750227 sometimes people will pull up and ask me what it spells which makes me think im not the best communicator
6750228 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6750229 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6750230 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6750231 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6750232 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6750233 men are animalistic in nature and from an entirely different planet therefore they cannot be tied down to one mate
6750234 ill be surprised if the reason for delaying is that mats doesnt know whether he wants to play again after having such a good season with us last year
6750235 he told me he never enjoyed playing hockey as much as he did last season so well see where it goes
6750236 i cant accept a trade because my in laws wont let me
6750237 they do not have the right to destroy bryan mccabes career they gave him as restrictive a contract as there is in the nhl today if they want to go to the most extreme of situations and tell him they will pay him to stay at home the artillery will be released from our end the p a will back bryan to the grave i guarantee it
6750238 bryan mccabe has lots of hockey left and the toronto maple leafs are not going to tell him to stay at home not a chance you cant destroy a players craft by sitting him at home and basically telling him your career is over that type of action would be something for the legal minds at the p a to deal with with that type of a welcome mat i cant see why there isnt a rush for all the free agents in the world to come and sign with the hockey club i mean thats just a wonderful way to treat a player but there will be absolutely no limit to what the players association will try to throw at the leafs well go at it hard
6750239 staying at real madrid is not my objective regarding next season
6750240 i respect the club a lot the players and most of all the fans who always treated me well but its not my aim
6750241 i have a good offer to me and to the club as well and my objective next season is not staying with real madrid
6750242 the main reason for that is that i fancy playing in england chelsea have a huge squad a great team i aim to play there
6750243 i have nothing against real madrid im very grateful to what they gave me but i hope this will be sorted as quickly as possible
6750244 its not about money just because i aim to move on my objective is to be the best player in the world and its not going to be possible at real madrid
6750245 i have finished a cycle i played three seasons for real madrid and gave my best i scored goals won two ligas and that is not easy

6750296 i respect the club a lot the players and most of all the fans who always treated me well but its not my aim
6750297 i have a good offer to me and to the club as well and my objective next season is not staying with real madrid
6750298 the main reason for that is that i fancy playing in england chelsea have a huge squad a great team i aim to play there
6750299 i have nothing against real madrid im very grateful to what they gave me but i hope this will be sorted as quickly as possible
6750300 its not about money just because i aim to move on my objective is to be the best player in the world and its not going to be possible at real madrid
6750301 i have finished a cycle i played three seasons for real madrid and gave my best i scored goals won two ligas and that is not easy

6750306 he was very adamant that it would always be about the wider game and thats what we are seeking to do
6750307 really symbolically show that continuity between the earlier players and the current players
6750308 its very important that country lads know that though they are playing on ant hills theyre playing in remote paddocks they can and they will play on the sydney cricket ground and at lords
6750309 its been recognised at bowral by the foundation and the trust of a need to take the bradman name to a wider audience and through an international hall of fame a cricket hall of fame at bowral an expansion of the museum to make it even more relevant to all age groups
6750310 this is a man who accumulates cricket memorabilia and photographs some of which were apparently lost
6750311 his contribution to the history of cricket has been very important this collector and this house will now be back in the hands of someone who desperately loves cricket
6750312 luckily we have the 1932 film footage and that provides a very good basis for us to restore the appearance and finishes of the verandah
6750313 its going to be very interesting to see whether the bradman name is as relevant in 50 years time in 100 years time
6750314 i sense it will never be forgotten it cant be because of his achievements were matchless
6750315 but of course test match cricket in 50 or 100 years time may not be the most significant form of the game we dont know what the culture of the game going to be
6750316 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6750317 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6750318 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6750319 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6750320 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees

6750338 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6750339 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6750340 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6750341 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6750342 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6750343 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6750344 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6750345 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6750346 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6750347 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6750348 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6750349 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6750350 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6750351 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6750352 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6750353 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6750354 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6750355 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6750356 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6750357 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6750358 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6750359 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6750360 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6750361 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6750362 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6750363 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6750364 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6750365 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6750366 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6750367 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6750368 obviously its devastating but above everything else im only one player and you can never win a championship with just one player
6750369 i have the utmost confidence in this team bringing home the gold
6750370 i want no more stuff where they tell you one thing and behind your back they do another thing
6750371 i think ive earned that respect for a team to sit down with me and tell me this is what we want this is what we want to do
6750372 im excited to watch them and cheer them on during this challenge theyve been presented with its really going to take everyone coming together i love them all so much and appreciate so many people involved with this game and the team
6750373 preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
6750374 the day that meth walked into our house was the day our life took a spiral
6750375 i did it all the time i liked everything about it
6750376 i didnt have time for my boyfriend or my daughter
6750377 i think its retarded i wish i had never done it
6750378 we viewed it as a consumer product researched it as a consumer product and marketed it or un marketed it as a consumer product
6750379 mario is really excited about getting to propose to lisa he has bought a ring and he cant wait to see her again
6750380 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6750381 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6750382 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6750383 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6750384 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6750385 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6750386 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6750387 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6750388 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6750389 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6750390 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6750391 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6750392 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6750393 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6750394 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6750395 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6750396 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6750397 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6750398 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6750399 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6750400 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6750401 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6750402 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6750403 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6750404 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6750405 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6750406 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6750407 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6750408 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6750409 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6750410 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6750411 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6750412 they told me there are going to be resources here
6750413 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6750414 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6750415 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6750416 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6750417 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6750418 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6750419 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6750420 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6750421 you could be the greatest musician in the world but if you stand in jeans and a t shirt next to me no one will notice you
6750422 a blog about urban places placemaking and the concept of place
6750423 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6750424 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6750425 the fundamental basis of this nations laws was given to moses on the mount the fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from exodus and st matthew from isaiah and st paul
6750426 i dont think we emphasize that enough these days if we dont have a proper fundamental moral background we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state
6750427 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
6750428 we have launched an inquiry into a sudden surge in new ration cards in the past 9 months about 1 lakh new ration cards have been made
6750429 the inquiry has come as a follow up to a comptroller and auditor general cag observation that how come the ration card population in himachal was more than the census population of the state
6750430 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6750431 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6750432 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6750433 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6750434 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6750435 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6750436 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6750437 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6750438 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6750439 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6750440 the hopefulness of obama the straight talk of mccain its what christopher shays has always stood for
6750441 he goes where the truth takes him never afraid to take a stand or oppose his own party in a sea of partisanship shays is different its not what is republican or democrat its what is right for america everyone has a congressman we have christopher shays
6750442 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6750443 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6750444 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6750445 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6750446 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6750447 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6750448 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6750449 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6750450 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6750451 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6750452 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6750453 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6750454 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6750455 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6750456 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6750457 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6750458 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6750459 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6750460 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6750461 no trippin we just have to stop dumping raw feces and piss into the ocean simple
6750462 i didnt know what to expect some kind of moonscape perhaps but it was incredible huge matrices of branching porites coral up to 8 meters 25 feet high had established creating a thriving coral reef habitat
6750463 throughout other parts of the lagoon it was awesome to see coral cover as high as 80 percent and large tree like branching coral formations with trunks 30 centimeters 12 inches thick
6750464 it seems like you won approval from all who write bs on every subject every day the know it alls stay true to yourself never change to please others or to fit in
6750465 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6750466 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6750467 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6750468 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6750469 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6750470 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6750471 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6750472 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6750473 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6750474 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6750475 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6750476 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6750477 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6750478 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6750479 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6750480 c program files java jre1 6 0 07 bin jusched exe
6750481 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6750482 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6750483 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6750484 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6750485 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6750486 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6750487 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6750488 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6750489 young mums mansion really resonated with our viewers and challenged peoples perceptions of single mums
6750490 im delighted the series is returning to the channel and it will be fascinating to see what impact involving single dads will have
6750491 it was hugely rewarding to see what a positive impact taking part had on the mums involved in young mums mansion
6750492 bringing in the boys will add a whole new dimension to the mansion
6750493 given the brinks home security teams highly successful track record in building their business from the ground up i am confident that they have the financial resources and the management talent to trade another powerful brand in the security industry
6750494 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6750495 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6750496 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6750497 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6750498 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6750499 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6750500 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6750501 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6750502 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6750503 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6750504 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc

6750508 das ist einfach ph nomenal was bei ihnen f r eine qualit t in den schl gen ist auch wenn sie in der defensive sind
6750509 die kippen mehr weg weil sie mehr qualit t und mehr spin haben wenn du das nicht gewohnt bist stimmt die automatik nicht wenn ich so eine qualit t im training jeden tag h tte k nnte ich mich sicher weiterentwickeln
6750510 gegen sie muss man jeden punkt mit 200 prozent konzentration und konsequenz spielen
6750511 da darf man sich keine sekunde einen konzentrationsfehler leisten denn dann kommen sie wie eine lokomotive es ist sehr schwer in der heutigen zeit sie aufzuhalten
6750512 es war nicht das was ich erhofft hatte das hei t aber nicht dass ich nicht damit zufrieden sein kann im team war es eine super platzierung platz vier haben wir noch nie geschafft

6750514 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6750515 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6750516 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6750517 which begs the question if his own wife doesnt trust him with her money why should we trust him with ours
6750518 ahhh im not sure i got to concentrate here on my work
6750519 he said all we have to do is find a really rich country like switzerland and marry it

6750527 i just wanted the tribe to say yes we recognize that you are just as important as any other tribe member and we will treat you and your spouse as we treat all tribal members
6750528 it can do anything good or anything bad to the tribes and the indian people as citizen indians
6750529 for our tribe we want people to walk in the shoes of other people and learn to respect differences
6750530 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6750531 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6750532 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6750533 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6750534 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6750535 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is

6750540 what concerns me more than anything is our savings rate
6750541 the problem is getting the public understanding and the political will to do something about it

6750546 staying at real madrid is not my objective regarding next season
6750547 i respect the club a lot the players and most of all the fans who always treated me well but its not my aim
6750548 i have a good offer to me and to the club as well and my objective next season is not staying with real madrid
6750549 the main reason for that is that i fancy playing in england chelsea have a huge squad a great team i aim to play there
6750550 i have nothing against real madrid im very grateful to what they gave me but i hope this will be sorted as quickly as possible
6750551 its not about money just because i aim to move on my objective is to be the best player in the world and its not going to be possible at real madrid
6750552 i have finished a cycle i played three seasons for real madrid and gave my best i scored goals won two ligas and that is not easy
6750553 the man started throwing wild punches at the woman who did not give up but kept punching back
6750554 men who harass women in public places should be expecting that kind of beating from women
6750555 coach rick neuheisel himself gave me a tour of the campus and showed me around its a beautiful campus and i love the area coach neuheisel is great when i first met him i felt like i had known him for a while hes easy to talk to and i like how serious he is about getting things going there
6750556 more information has come to light that did point to discrepancies
6750557 we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further with the national chinese federation if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into as to why there is a discrepancy
6750558 my real age is 16 i dont care about what other people say its none of my business
6750559 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6750560 what were seeing in business in our retail businesses or anything having to do with housing is even a further slowing down in june and july both in terms of credit experience where people first got in trouble with house payments and now credit card payments
6750561 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6750562 we can solve these problems but we need to start soon
6750563 an eye opener i think there is cause for concern
6750564 my first step is to become more aware of whats going on instead of assuming somebody is taking care of me
6750565 people have this idea that things will work out and ill make sure i get mine
6750566 but they just kind of have their heads in the sand
6750567 i might contact a congressman and say hey listen up here you guys this is what the country needs if enough people do that it has some impact
6750568 you would have hundreds of thousands of dollars and could spend it right back into the economy
6750569 i hope these guys buffett and all these guys with money a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience and wisdom i hope that they really bring it together communicationwise so people can get it and actually do something

6750571 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6750572 i think pedro has the gift of instincts probably the greatest instincts of any pitcher in our era
6750573 knowing how when and what to do outweighs talent at times but eventually talent catches up bobby cox had greg maddux in atlanta hed throw 80 something pitches and go pretty deep but then he didnt want to send him through the lineup another time pedro is getting there at some point where does his trickology go from there
6750574 i keep asking myself since i came here when are we going to get things going our way i think that if were going to get it this is the right time
6750575 i didnt think he hit it as hard as he did
6750576 he was off his front foot and just kind of flicked it to left field i thought it was going to get down i was sort of stuck there between second and third
6750577 i dont know where he was going he just wanted to score so bad
6750578 hes the head guy so the investment he has made in his teammates says a lot about the leadership
6750579 i felt good and i was seeing the ball good

6750594 we will definitely try our outmost to ensure that they will not pull out because we have promised to work together to serve the country

6750596 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff

6750600 i believe our country is worth fighting for dont you
6750601 i firmly believe the best way to fight that fight and to win it is by electing barack obama the next president of the united states
6750602 wondering whats happened to this great country we love so much
6750603 ive seen his obamas passion his determination his grace and his grit
6750604 hes lived the american dream he wants to be sure that dream is there for us
6750605 but i need a president to work with and so do you
6750606 we need a democratic president back in the white house
6750607 hes really going to have to support the american ways and the american people

6750631 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6750632 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6750633 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6750634 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6750635 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6750636 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore

6750641 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6750642 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6750643 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6750644 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6750645 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6750646 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6750647 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6750648 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6750649 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6750650 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6750651 this is unbelievable i simply cant believe it its a dream come true
6750652 i simply started playing flw fantasy fishing because i love fishing and because it was fun we have a lot of dreams and this will help us make many of them come true
6750653 i dreamed about the biggest payday in bass fishing when the champion of the forrest wood cup could claim the first 1 million prize in bass fishing fifteen years later we achieved my personal goal of awarding 1 million to our forrest wood cup champion not once but as of last sunday two years in a row
6750654 a vote is like a rifle its usefulness depends upon the character of the user
6750655 gulf of maine is the saudi arabia of wind power
6750656 hubo m s de un fallo en el desastre del jk 5022
6750657 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6750658 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6750659 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6750660 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6750661 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6750662 originally the administration suggested that the key measure was whether it gave breathing room for political reconciliation so far i think we have not seen the kind of political reconciliation thats going to bring about long term stability in iraq
6750663 lets be clear our troops have completed every mission theyve been given
6750664 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6750665 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6750666 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6750667 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6750668 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6750669 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6750670 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6750671 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6750672 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6750673 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6750674 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6750675 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6750676 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6750677 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6750678 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6750679 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6750680 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6750681 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6750682 the profit before interest and tax for the continuing businesses expressed on a constant currency basis was up 9 4 per cent this increase continues the positive momentum established over the past 18 months
6750683 the strategy for pet packaging of focusing on the higher growth custom containers segment where it has a strong market position supported by industry leading technology has been correct with returns for the business increasing from 9 2 to 12 per cent over the past two years
6750684 the business has made substantial progress in recovering these increases via contractual pass throughs
6750685 earnings for the year were up strongly as the business continued to lower its cost base improve product mix and recover raw material cost increases
6750686 the short term outlook for raw material input costs is for stability at the current high levels in the medium term lower cost polymer capacity is scheduled to commence production and it is likely resin supplier margins will reduce at that time
6750687 this plant will be a global leader in extrusion lamination and is ideally located in a high growth low cost region

6750691 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6750692 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6750693 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6750694 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

6750705 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6750706 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6750707 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6750708 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6750709 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6750710 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6750711 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

6750719 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
6750720 for me the important thing wasnt about rights or the benefits
6750721 shouldnt have to search through the remains of their belongings
6750722 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6750723 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6750724 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6750725 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6750726 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6750727 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6750728 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6750729 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6750730 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6750731 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6750732 do you know that song you dont how do you not know that song
6750733 its really exciting its one of the biggest mysteries right now
6750734 kindles success whatever that is all we have currently is secondhand rumors on number of units does not prove drm is good customers do not realize the gotcha until they want to move their purchases to another device
6750735 then they realize what the issue is kindle was just released 8 months ago most customers have not thought about upgrading to other devices yet
6750736 a year or two from now is when the backlash will start to kick in many kindle customers new to e books are not even aware of the issue yet
6750737 id be happier if i could read kindle books on my iphone 3g or my mac or if i could print individual pages or copy text into an e mail
6750738 but i figure that i get 99 percent of the potential enjoyment from just reading a book
6750739 your kindle will one day die and so will your drm protected
6750740 it is fun and really challenging the hardest part is steering the board i found standing up and going forward easy to do
6750741 yes do it definitely get some instruction remember that you will fall off a million times but you will learn to be the master of the board
6750742 we like a lot football clubs in the country have got an interest in jimmy
6750743 unvaccinated kids are healthier than vaccinated ones fewer colds coughs and other minor infections
6750744 i knew much about bolton because one of my favourite players was okocha
6750745 adrians energy and expertise are renowned in the wholesale insurance industry
6750746 he and his team will have a significant and immediate impact on all of our operations
6750747 bob mcauley and loti woods have built an impressive national wholesale presence while still maintaining a boutique entrepreneurial spirit
6750748 i am tremendously excited about the opportunity to build on this foundation in the midwest region
6750749 we like a lot football clubs in the country have got an interest in jimmy
6750750 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6750751 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6750752 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6750753 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6750754 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6750755 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6750756 att sluta nia i ett os r egentligen v rdel st
6750757 you realistically tell me how many internationals have they got how many rep players have they got how many origin players you tell me
6750758 im just very excited about the fact weve got a team of players here
6750759 we can still improve we have to improve if we want to make a mark in the playoffs we have to improve still
6750760 it was 20 points how much more attack you want you cant do much more than 20 points to nil
6750761 at times there it looked like we were about to strike but then we just came up with nothing so yeah there are issues
6750762 n o me surpreende que homens nessas sociedades vivam mais que homens em sociedades monog micas onde eles ficam vi vos e ningu m cuida deles
6750763 he was giving me boy advice and you know there was a candle on the table but i didnt think it was a date
6750764 and when i saw the trailer i was like oh my gosh
6750765 i just want to say for the record that doug and i never kissed or anything like that
6750766 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites
6750767 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap

6750769 you know the position but i cannot tell you much more there is interest always in players i do not want to give you any names
6750770 there are a handful of insurers that have pretty decent exposure
6750771 ok sir i will call you tomorrow after consulting with the concerning department
6750772 no one can say you must not run faster than this or jump higher than that
6750773 the factors that affect our business are not at all correlated to the short term oil price the long term factors which affect our business have not changed in the last two months
6750774 there was a knee jerk reaction not just in the exploration companies but in the oil services as well
6750775 were baffled by the flood of money out of the sector
6750776 everyone knows the fundamentals for the industry are great but the cycle has been changing and youre now in execution mode
6750777 what you see is that some of these companies cannot live up to expectations not because the end market is not so strong but its about good execution

6750779 people need to be responsible for themselves and their children
6750780 the male was removed from the establishment and police and ems were called
6750781 if the devil had a name it would be chuck finley
6750782 in my line of work you stay in the shadows so the name finley is never mentioned
6750783 look we got it covered were just trying to find a place to put mikes yogurt while we do the job
6750784 you know some guys who can help move a fridge the cooler doesnt hold much beer mike
6750785 you know mike if you had to have a stepdad you could do worse
6750786 dealling with a trained operative is like playing chess with a master dealing with a criminal on the other hand is like playing checkers with a three year old they like to change the rules
6750787 how can theatre use technology in a way that enhances the liveness of the experience whats the most cost efficient way to build a floating stage
6750788 interpretar las escrituras mahometanas como si no presentaran obst culo alguno para la coexistencia pac fica con los infieles parece un gran reto

6750792 there is no reason why we wouldnt want him to perform and i dont know why we didnt contact him
6750793 i am surprised by the level of affection for me and for 19
6750794 have been listening to your two albums when i can however unfortunately our long range patrol vehicles dont come standard with cd players so we cant listen to your songs in the lup lying up post instead were stuck listening to the local call to prayer five times a day
6750795 i owe my life to the choppers at long tan
6750796 property is not the sacred right when a rich man becomes poor it is a misfortune it is not a moral evil when a poor man becomes destitute it is a moral evil teeming with consequences and injurious to society and morality
6750797 if most of us are ashamed of shabby clothes and shoddy furniture let us be more ashamed of shabby ideas and shoddy philosophies it would be a sad situation if the wrapper were better than the meat wrapped inside it
6750798 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
6750799 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
6750800 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
6750801 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
6750802 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
6750803 for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of the ability to serve if elected
6750804 kieran is playing better than anyone at the club at the moment i wanted to name him on the bench for the preston game but we already had three attacking players as subs i want to bring players like kieran through
6750805 the biggest thing for me about the goals conceded was within the group we have to take individual responsibility when the ball arrives in the box and take responsibility to clear the lines
6750806 we havent done that and we have paid a heavy price
6750807 we are not just laying everything at the door of the defence because ultimately its a team thing and we need to defend all over the park
6750808 they need to win the individual battles and then we wont be giving away the soft goals we have been
6750809 without making excuses every bit of bad luck that could come their way has happened so what you do is get back on the training ground work your socks off to put that right and hopefully you can translate that work into the game on saturday
6750810 we will go to palace in good heart because we know we are capable of winning games in the championship
6750811 we know it will be a tough fixture but we will make sure the lads are ready to give their best
6750812 this team will get better the longer they play together but first and foremost its important we get those points on the board to allow us to develop that and take it on burnleys top scorer martin paterson 3 goals in 3 matches burnleys bad boy robbie blake palace old boys ade akinbiyi gabor kiraly young paterson broke on to the football scene 3 4 years ago and has now started to flourish in the 06 07 season the then 19 year old hit in 7 goals for grimsby whilst out on loan the following season he notched up a tally of 14 goals for relegated scunthorpe this season he has 3 goals in as many games although only one goal in the league at only 59
6750813 if we pass this bill which the democrats irresponsibly oppose well solve this problem
6750814 if we bring a new attitude of hopefulness and respect for the world well make the seas higher and the fish more numerous
6750815 the first weekend we came in after we beat washington and some guys had stuff stolen out of their wallets their lockers an ipod some stuff like that
6750816 it was pretty funny because we didnt realize what was gonna come but you almost have to just laugh at it all
6750817 it dawned on me toward the end of the season that the guys never said anything of the travel situation
6750818 the players the other coaches none of them ever said anything about it the guys never blamed a bad performance or a disappointing loss on the fact that we were always traveling
6750819 it feels good obviously any time you can get back to championship weekend
6750820 winning the championship in this league is quite hard but repeating is essentially impossible and trying to do what were trying to do is something most people wouldnt even think is worth talking about
6750821 the achievements of middle class majority ethnic white irish students are not and never were under threat yet this ultimately is what is driving this campaign
6750822 commodities the stuff that feeds us runs our cars heats our homes and provides the basic materials of everyday life recently enjoyed one of the great bull runs of modern investment history nearly doubling in price in the space of a year
6750823 the recent bull run in commodities was based more on investment demand than the fundamentals of the world economy
6750824 i have found the bigger anniversaries like christmas and his birthday are difficult but you do them as a whole family so it is not as bad
6750825 it is the smaller dates that only i know about that are really hard like october 6 was when he passed out and i remember the date when i saw him for the last time i have got hundreds of memories of him and i always feel he is here he is all around us constantly i just need him to be all around me
6750826 i think everyone will remember aaron just for the smile he had he had a real presence i will always remember him with pride and that will never go away no matter how many years pass
6750827 ive always been quite a private person and like to keep myself to myself if i dont speak to people and get on with my day it is ok but as soon as i talk to people about him i start crying because its like a huge reminder that he is definitely not coming back
6750828 if i am just in my own world i can pretend that he is just away for a bit even though i know deep down that he isnt
6750829 this pain isnt going to last another year or ten years it is forever
6750830 i go to the cemetery nearly every single day i can i passed my test about six months ago aaron said he was chuffed i was going to learn
6750831 the walk with the nine mothers was extremely emotional to speak to people who know exactly how you are feeling and what you are going through is so nice
6750832 the lows are still really bad the pain gets less as in its not every day but i still think about him every day it doesnt matter what you are doing he is there
6750833 it doesnt take much to make me think of him just silly things like an advert on the television or a song
6750834 for all of us in the family it has made us realise there is a lot more important things in life than everyday moans and groans we have had a couple of get togethers over the last year and the happy times we had with aaron always come out then
6750835 i made the decision to spend the first anniversary with the other families my father allan and stepmother linda will also be coming with me
6750836 we all still miss him very much it feels like such a long time since we saw him but then again it doesnt seem like a year since we found out he died
6750837 i always remember his smiling face he will always be that 19 year old to us we will never know him as an older man and that is hard
6750838 i sometimes find it hard at work when people mention their grandchildren and i always have to tell them about aaron
6750839 every time i see another solider killed i am back at square one we want to keep his memory alive
6750840 i was quite shocked about the possibility of a manslaughter charge
6750841 i try not to think about what the government is doing because it seems to make me angry every time there is another death i get angry at the government for sending troops out they havent had to go through what we have
6750842 blame doesnt come into it we just want to know why
6750843 when aaron first went away i was watching the news constantly now i can never watch it i try to keep away from the papers but i still see some of them when i hear about another death you instantly think of the family you know what they are going to be feeling when they open that door
6750844 the sooner the inquest is held the better it is just one more thing to put behind us suffolk homes
6750845 the plot takes second place to wenders fascination with the contrast between the neon and billboard ambience of the u s and the rolling hills and the industrial pockets of deutschland
6750846 no quiero pol ticos a mi lado lo que quiero son soluciones ya que no han solucionado lo que ha pasado
6750847 lo que est n diciendo ah no lo quiero escuchar porque son mentiras todo que nos traigan a los nuestros yo tengo a mis dos hijos y a mi nieto esperando llevo tres d as esperando y no me dice nadie nada
6750848 no ha prometido nada lo nico es que si estamos a gusto que si estamos a gusto
6750849 c mo va a estar a gusto una persona que tiene ah una herida que no se le va a curar en la vida
6750850 somos muchos porque nos han matado a muchos y hoy vamos a empezar ya primero vamos a enterrar a los nuestros y vamos a empezar ya
6750851 spending behind the united states presidential election and around the beijing olympic games should continue to boost 2008 revenues
6750852 however the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6750853 the very best of the beach boys sounds of summer
6750854 i have found the bigger anniversaries like christmas and his birthday are difficult but you do them as a whole family so it is not as bad
6750855 it is the smaller dates that only i know about that are really hard like october 6 was when he passed out and i remember the date when i saw him for the last time i have got hundreds of memories of him and i always feel he is here he is all around us constantly i just need him to be all around me

6750860 i go to the cemetery nearly every single day i can i passed my test about six months ago aaron said he was chuffed i was going to learn
6750861 the walk with the nine mothers was extremely emotional to speak to people who know exactly how you are feeling and what you are going through is so nice
6750862 the lows are still really bad the pain gets less as in its not every day but i still think about him every day it doesnt matter what you are doing he is there
6750863 it doesnt take much to make me think of him just silly things like an advert on the television or a song
6750864 for all of us in the family it has made us realise there is a lot more important things in life than everyday moans and groans we have had a couple of get togethers over the last year and the happy times we had with aaron always come out then
6750865 i made the decision to spend the first anniversary with the other families my father allan and stepmother linda will also be coming with me
6750866 we all still miss him very much it feels like such a long time since we saw him but then again it doesnt seem like a year since we found out he died
6750867 i always remember his smiling face he will always be that 19 year old to us we will never know him as an older man and that is hard
6750868 i sometimes find it hard at work when people mention their grandchildren and i always have to tell them about aaron
6750869 every time i see another solider killed i am back at square one we want to keep his memory alive
6750870 i was quite shocked about the possibility of a manslaughter charge
6750871 i try not to think about what the government is doing because it seems to make me angry every time there is another death i get angry at the government for sending troops out they havent had to go through what we have
6750872 blame doesnt come into it we just want to know why
6750873 when aaron first went away i was watching the news constantly now i can never watch it i try to keep away from the papers but i still see some of them when i hear about another death you instantly think of the family you know what they are going to be feeling when they open that door
6750874 the sooner the inquest is held the better it is just one more thing to put behind us suffolk homes
6750875 i am convinced that the fact that tommy and his family find themselves in this unfortunate position is a true anomaly
6750876 therefore i respectfully and humbly request that you consider probation during the sentencing phase of this judicial process

6750952 the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6750953 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6750954 other studies have looked at pregnancy rates but what is really important is whether or not there is a baby
6750955 the live birth rate per pregnancy is an even more telling number since some cycles get cancelled there was a 42 live birth rate per pregnancy in the acupuncture group compared to a 35 rate in the nonacupuncture group

6750974 but barack obama had a crucial advantage over his rivals this year the support of the national media especially the three broadcast networks
6750975 at every step of his national political career network reporters showered the illinois senator with glowing media coverage building him up as a political celebrity and exhibiting little interest in investigating his past associations or exploring the controversies that could have threatened his campaign
6750976 when it mattered most as he debuted on the national scene
6750977 this study proves emphatically and without question that the big three networks had a horse in this years democratic primary race and that with their wall to wall 24 hour daily assistance nbc abc and cbs provided sen barack obamas margin of victory
6750978 as the liberal medias ardor with sen hillary clinton evaporated so too did the inevitability of her victory the press fixated their infatuated gazes on sen obama and afforded him the crucial coverage and support he needed to win

6751000 when we were designing the latest version of docmetrics we asked our customers and prospects what features they would like to see added to our dynamic pdf forms technology

6751002 the latest additions to our software improve not only the way forms look but also the way they perform within adobe reader

6751023 growth in other domestic demand indicators such as credit extension to the private sector and motor vehicles sales remain subdued indicating that past policy action by the bank of namibia was successful in curbing price pressure originating from domestic sources
6751024 in this connection there has already been a significant decline in international crude oil prices from a peak of us 148 per barrel in july to us 113 on 20 august which should provide relief to inflationary pressures going forward moreover there have been welcome reductions in certain food commodity prices such as dairy products cereals and sugar
6751025 i am pleased to report another quarter with very strong operational and financial performance during this quarter we continued with the consistent implementation of our strategy both in the drybulk and the ultra deep water drilling udw sectors in the drybulk sector consistent with our belief in the positive long term fundamentals of the drybulk market we continued with our fleet renewal and expansion replacing older tonnage with newer and larger vessels when all the s amp p transactions announced to date have been completed by the end of the first quarter of 2009 we expect to have a fleet of 47 vessels including 7 newbuilding drybulk carriers with an average age of 6 9 years well below the industry average this reaffirms our leadership position and puts the company in a unique position to consolidate the drybulk sector our exposure to the spot market continues to prove very beneficial for our company as we have been able to take advantage of the record freight rates at the same time by also gradually securing 68 5 of our fleet under time charters for the remainder of 2008 55 for 2009 49 7 for 2010 and 46 7 for 2011 we have locked in sizeable cash flows which enhance the visibility and stability of our earnings for the longer term in the udw drilling sector we are successfully executing our previously announced plans we have arranged financing for the 2 udw drillships on order at samsung and have successfully completed the ocr acquisition by de listing the company from the oslo stock exchange we continue to remain focused on maximizing shareholders value and delivering superior results

6751033 levels of activity in 2008 should match those seen in 2007 and there are significant new business opportunities
6751034 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6751035 in addition the new united states president will have to wrestle with twin fiscal and budget deficits in early 2009 and post the olympics chinese growth may slow due to inflationary particularly food price concerns and the impact that a weakening united states economy has on the rest of the world

6751083 we are so detached from the urban art world a lot of excellent works are missed
6751084 fred is about introducing contemporary art to the rural area to ensure the land of the forgotten gets a taster of urban life
6751085 in freds second year we thought wed invite jenny holtzer to contribute for a laugh she agreed to create some artwork on the till receipts at tebay service station so over the course of fred we gave away over half a million works by one of the worlds most famous artists
6751086 you might wonder why she agreed to the project its because she understands our position jenny lives in the catskill mountains just outside new york she moved there to get away from the art world clique to avoid being influenced by anything other than her own thoughts she gets what we stand for
6751087 moaning about a flashing sign some places need to get with the 21st century
6751088 it is incredibly hard to pinpoint and capture tradition when so many things including the landscape are constantly changing
6751089 for a 2002 exhibition in eden the curator said i could do absolutely anything as long as it wasnt too big that was their first big mistake
6751090 too big wasnt a problem i decided to enter a collection of pickled penises
6751091 some people loved it and thought it was hilarious others were disgusted and offended i thought it was great either way
6751092 the telling thing was that every single comment in the guest book was about my project every single one i say at least it provoked an emotion in everybody
6751093 i cant reveal much about the magic of the fairies they may be due to return this year
6751094 you find people can rarely remember the detail of an individual landscape because after a while all views look the same especially when you live among them day by day
6751095 but put something unusual in the middle of an area and you have a reference point to remember details by
6751096 during that time nobody appreciated the iconic scenes of the lakes those who wanted beauty would search abroad
6751097 drop is meant to represent two things it is reflective like a claude glass and shaped like a raindrop the building block of the lakes those who hate the rain should think without it we wouldnt have tourism
6751098 it was the perfect way to get maximum exposure because more people travel along that line in a day than visit northumberland in a year
6751099 as well as stressing how instrumental the farming community is i wanted to point out that you can still be a tourist appreciate the beautiful landscapes around us even if you are merely passing through
6751100 it may be as removed from the art world as you can get but the upside is you can be yourself here
6751101 purity of idea is the most important thing in art
6751102 if youre influenced by the city clique you achieve nothing original life as an artist is pointless

6751112 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
6751113 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
6751114 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
6751115 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
6751116 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
6751117 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
6751118 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
6751119 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
6751120 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
6751121 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
6751122 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
6751123 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
6751124 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
6751125 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
6751126 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
6751127 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

6751135 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates

6751226 more and more the economy is shifting toward energy initiatives that i think could occur throughout ohio here in columbiana county as well as elsewhere
6751227 if the efforts that were putting into energy initiatives like solar wind clean coal technologies and bio fuels were to materialize as we hope they do it could provide basically a new kind of economy for the region
6751228 that could be the most significant economic development activity in this region for decades if it were to materialize

6751245 one of the key reasons for the success of the chevrolet cobalt and pontiac g5 is the lordstown workforce and the strong partnerships with the uaw and local and state officials
6751246 based on the quality of work and these strong partnerships we are pleased to announce our plans to invest another 500 million in the chevy cruze product program in the u s including more than 350 million in lordstown
6751247 the cruze will build on the already successful chevrolet cobalt cobalt xfe and cobalt ss all of which are nearly sold out in dealer showrooms
6751248 our dealers are asking for many more cobalts than we can build
6751249 the chevrolet cruze was designed and engineered by our global teams in europe and asia pacific and will be manufactured in those regions in addition to the assembly plant here in lordstown ohio
6751250 our goal for the chevrolet cruze is to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment
6751251 mirror mirror on the wall whos the fairest of them all
6751252 the oci are appalled about the situation because scandals like this dog us in every games
6751253 ive said before i left ireland that my wish for these games was that ireland would not be involved in any doping scandal of any nature unfortunately this has now become a huge embarrassment for the country
6751254 i think its a more serious problem for equestrian sport and also for the horse industry in ireland because theres an international olympic committee vote next year on which sports will remain on the olympic programme and which will go out
6751255 the doping issues in equestrian sport are completely controlled by the international equestrian federedation fei not by us or the irish sports council and there seems to be too many situations like this
6751256 it would be a rush if it wasnt ready i suppose but in terms of the recording we finished it in late june early july but the way media can be disseminated these days we figured if its finished then its ready to be heard i think certainly if wed decided to go the other route the cd being the first thing people heard i think we would have had to have a conversation about how we might tackle that this time around obviously the internet is such a tool for people so a lot of people dont think twice about going online to try and find music so why not use that to your advantage i suppose
6751257 we had one foot on each island as it were and in a way we were trying to remember whats been the heart of what we do
6751258 if anything with the second record there was a bit of a compromise behind it in that we were trying to marry up the two elements and not quite landing on either sort of level i suppose so why not just take it a bit further in each direction and actually follow it through a bit further
6751259 i think we just wanted to revisit some of the ways of working wed enjoyed and be a bit more choosy about where we split the various talents of those two guys and marry it up with the songs we had at that point
6751260 its a bit more disjointed in terms of the continuity it was just a different approach but im not sure if it was better or worse just a different attack and one that suited this record
6751261 when we recorded it we just tried to get the songs sounding as good as they possibly could and there are two songs wed never recorded that are on this record
6751262 we had talked about doing another record and theres another record on the table under our contract with metal blade we can do it if we want if we dont whatever but we have discussed doing another record and im kind of excited about tinkering with ideas for it that said if we did start writing a new album and it wasnt turning out like an overcast record i dont think wed put it out it really needs to have a certain vibe it cant be another metalcore record like the things that are going on these days it really needs to have that old school mentality which we had held true back then if not its not even worth it
6751263 we didnt want to change it too much and we didnt want it to sound like a different band
6751264 at the same time we didnt want to give fans the exact same record but we did want it to feel like the same band some of the stuff was recorded the way wed played the songs live because when youve played something 100 000 times you end up tweaking it changing it slightly so the new album reflects some of the older songs and how we used to play them live back then
6751265 im one of those dudes who needs to write constantly because i really suck at writing music with a deadline
6751266 my brain gets fried and i cant do anything i just shut down completely when we start on this next one well just bring our demos to practice and well listen to them judge them and start rearranging the parts that need to be rearranged or we just start jamming on what sounds cool
6751267 has at least one blast beat and very fast drumming with really slow riffs
6751268 it could be really not fun for me but thats something to consider

6751274 i would play all these small places in new york where a lot of young musicians get their start
6751275 i would do whatever i could do to get people talking about my music a couple of years into it we could get like 300 or 400 people to show up at new york music venue s o b s but at first we were happy to get like 50 or 60 or 70 people to show up

6751278 john legend is a nickname that some friends started calling me and it kind of grew into my stage name
6751279 legend is something that i never would have chosen for myself originally it grew to the point where more people in my circle would know me by that name than by my real name i had to make a decision

6751284 you will not make it in this business and succeed over a long period of time unless you work really hard
6751285 i had to learn as i went when i was grinding and it does make you appreciate your success it makes you realize that its really about the work its really about making the best music you can make its really about working hard

6751311 positiv ist dass wir hier die weichen reifen und hei e bedingungen haben was gut f r uns ist
6751312 denn es gibt lange geraden und auf diesen haben wir in den vergangenen jahren in bezug auf die h chstgeschwindigkeit immer ein wenig zu k mpfen gehabt wir m ssen abwarten wenn es mit den weichen reifen und unter den hei en bedingungen so gut funktioniert wie in budapest dann sollte alles in ordnung sein
6751313 jedes mal wenn ich an eine strecke komme bin ich mir nicht sicher wo wir stehen denn es geht in den top 10 einfach so eng zu in hockenheim hatten wir eine gute geschwindigkeit auch wenn dies das ergebnis nicht zeigte aber budapest hat gezeigt dass wir einen weiteren schritt nach vorn gemacht haben hoffentlich k nnen wir dies hier wiederholen
6751314 aber schlussendlich beginnt jedes rennen von null und wir m ssen weiterhin hart arbeiten wir haben uns verbessert auch ich habe mich im verlauf des jahres ziemlich deutlich gesteigert das problem ist dass dies die ergebnisse nicht immer zeigen
6751315 in den ersten paar rennen hatte ich mit untersteuern zu k mpfen und das gef hl f r das auto war nicht 100 prozentig es hat sich von rennen zu rennen verbessert und nun ist das auto so wie ich es haben m chte wenn ich einsteige ich hoffe dass wir diesen schwung aufrechterhalten k nnen
6751316 das wusste ich schon zuvor als ich meinen vertrag unterschrieb ich habe einen mehrj hrigen vertrag hatte also nie irgendwelche zweifel
6751317 das ist schwierig zu sagen man wei nie wie sich die ver nderungen am reglement auf die teams auswirken werden hoffentlich werden wir in der lage sein unseren schwung in das jahr 2009 mitzunehmen und st rker und st rker werden es w re gro artig kommendes jahr in der lage zu sein in die punkte zu fahren
6751318 ich hatte nach budapest ganz sch n viel zu tun
6751319 ich habe realisiert dass die aktivit ten nach einem rennen wie diesen einen ganz sch n viel energie kosten k nnen aber auf dem podium zu stehen war dies nat rlich alles wert auch wenn ich mich nach dem rennen aufgrund meiner magen probleme ziemlich m de gef hlt habe
6751320 wir verf gen nun ber eine gute basis von nun an werden wir bei jedem rennen kleinere verbesserungen haben
6751321 mein plan war es gewesen zur mitte der saison vor allem im qualifying auf jarnos niveau zu sein und diese guten ergebnisse in der zweiten h lfte des jahres zu haben aber alles ist etwas fr her gekommen es gibt noch raum f r verbesserungen ich denke dass budapest gezeigt hat was das paket und ich erreichen k nnen hoffentlich k nnen wir in dieser richtung konstanter sein

6751324 it was a tremendous game to snap our losing streak and it went right down to the wire
6751325 we knew people were writing about it everywhere now we want to win a couple more
6751326 i just try to take care of things i can control
6751327 every guy in that room knows we can hit better
6751328 it got me pretty square then i had to go toward first base but i had to get the out as bad as it hurt i just went after it and was able to make the play
6751329 when we came inside i said im going to take my shirt off and give everybody high fives
6751330 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
6751331 ive been able to get down in the zone low and get a lot of ground balls and strikeouts
6751332 the sinker had great action the changeup was really good tonight
6751333 it just has such action down below the hitting area out of the hand it looks like a good pitch to hit and you have to commit
6751334 i think the toronto market has matured to a point where its able to accept projects of this nature
6751335 its a natural evolution instead of taking a green field and building a huge tower

6751340 hes been doing a great job with it and i think he just needs some more time right now
6751341 i expect to catch that ball ive got to catch that
6751342 id been playing punto to pull all night and he hit it right where i was supposed to be if it hits your glove youve got to catch that
6751343 i could have buried that split finger a little bit better than i did
6751344 i could have bounced it a little bit more and gone for the strikeout and if i did who knows what would have happened i do everything to prepare myself to pitch but im not getting the results i want its frustrating
6751345 nicky ripped it pretty good and torii had a long ways to go
6751346 weve seen him make plenty of catches like that and im glad he didnt make it but hes as good as they get out there we got a little lucky there
6751347 it all starts with pitching and scott baker was really really good going up against mr lackey whos always really good against us
6751348 we knew we were going to be in for a battle and it was its a nice start to a road trip
6751349 lackey can bear down and make pitches in situations like that as good as anybody in the game
6751350 we missed some opportunities but in those opportunities you look over at the other side and you see whos pitching he didnt miss too many spots
6751351 when you hit it good you kind of have that look
6751352 but i know this park and the ball doesnt really travel at night i hit it good enough but at 387 feet its a little deep i guess that was tough to swallow
6751353 i was just like anybody else who made a mistake i was treated like everybody else
6751354 i was afforded a lot of humility i think im a better person for it

6751369 its embraced in our culture its part of our way of life
6751370 the delivery of the games has been quite awesome and quite humbling furlong told a news conference
6751371 the door has been left open to us to improve over beijing in some areas namely cutting down on the number of empty seats in the venues stirring up more enthusiasm among the fans in them and encouraging more participation by local residents in olympic related festivities
6751372 we have a real opportunity not just to celebrate but to bring every citizen of the city into the games every night to give them a sense of ownership over the project furlong said
6751373 this public engagement is going to be an important part of our story
6751374 were not going to assume that we can just do things the way theyve been done before and expect our seats to be full said dave cobb an executive vice president of vancouvers organizing committee
6751375 its a very complex challenge so the atmosphere is what the athletes and spectators deserve were determined to improve it
6751376 we will do everything we can to get more tickets in hands of public cobb said
6751377 they were criticized a bit at the beginning but theyve made us all very proud furlong said

6751403 most artists are brought to their vocation when their own nascent gifts are awakened by the work of a master that is to say most artists are converted to art by art itself the future artist finds himself or herself moved by a work of art and through that experience comes to labor in the service of art until he can profess his own gifts those of us who do not become artists nonetheless attend to art in a similar spirit we come to painting to poetry to the stage hoping to revive the soul and any artist whose work touches us earns our gratitude it is when art acts as an agent of transformation that we may correctly speak of it as a gift

6751485 if the president wants to go to war our job is to find the intelligence to allow him to do so
6751486 russia does not have in its possession any trustworthy data that supports the existence of nuclear weapons or any weapons of mass destruction in iraq and we have not received any such information from our partners as yet this fact has also been supported by the information sent by the cia to the us congress
6751487 there may be a difference of perspective about weapons of mass destruction there is one certain way to find out and that is to let the inspectors back in to do their job that is the key point on which we are both agreed

6751624 john terry has been captain of chelsea for quite a while that must have been an advantage
6751625 the difference here is that i operate my captains on seniority
6751626 in the long term rio will be captain of manchester united there is no question about that it is a position we are very comfortable with that
6751627 his leadership qualities have improved tremendously over the last couple of years and his ability is there for all to see
6751628 i dont think anyone was actually nailed on for it
6751629 it was always a flip of the coin between rio or john terry

6751639 as a result of the investigation the director determined that prior to the fire and explosion a truck driver at the murray rd facility was engaged in a truck to truck propane transfer
6751640 the investigation further determined that the prohibited unsafe practice of transferring propane product from one truck to another was a frequent and routine operating practice at the facility
6751641 despite the order issued by the inspector the authorization holders or their directors or officers routinely allowed the unsafe practice of transferring propane product from truck to truck
6751642 the inability or unwillingness of the directors and officers to prevent the unsafe practice leaves the director of the opinion that the activity permitted by the authorizations will not be carried out safely
6751643 i highly respect the club the players and especially the fans whove always treated me well but thats not my objective

6751666 i think that we will get to the bottom of this
6751667 you have bread butter mayonnaise lettuce cheese and the meat thats in question so theyre still trying to analyze what component of that may have been the problem
6751668 if we take the bacteria cases in the states with tomatoes and the jalapeno peppers it took about six months for them to nail it down
6751669 the fact that we were able to go forward with a probable cause in two and a half weeks with a recall with a very small number of cases really shows how we were able to move so quickly on the matter its very intense detective work
6751670 if you think you have the tainted meat get rid of it immediately
6751671 that would be a little bit of an overkill from my perspective that would be overly cautious
6751672 thats the reason for us putting out the public alert so if anybody remembers eating that meat somewhere and gets sick then they can maybe go to their physician
6751673 at the end of the day it this recall could happen to anybody and fortunately it didnt happen to us
6751674 recently we had a tomato recall and our tomatoes were not affected at all but it was still bad publicity people are hypochondriacs even though we are not affected by this at all it will undoubtedly have a bad impact on us

6751710 devo ammettere di non essere molto emozionato perch lo sono stato nella prima apparizione al barbera dello scorso anno oggi mi sento tranquillo domani giocheremo per la prima volta una partita vera davanti al nostro pubblico e spero di poter regalare loro il primo sorriso per noi continua colantuono quella contro il ravenna sar una partita importante perch da questa inizia il cammino nella tim cup che vorremmo percorrere il pi possibile per sar una gara dove le insidie saranno dietro langolo il ravenna contro di noi moltiplicher le forze e paradossalmente sarebbe stato meglio incontrare una grande e non una compagine di categoria inferiore tuttavia io ho gi parlato con i miei giocatori sanno come la penso non dovranno esserci cali di concentrazione dovranno lottare su ogni pallone cos come voglio che accada sempre in campionato perch sarebbe un errore pensare di aver gi vinto in italia nessuno si pu permettere di sottovalutare un avversario

6751757 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6751758 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6751759 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6751760 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class

6751801 i believe strongly in respecting the stages there is a time when you have to play for fun enjoy the game argentinas strong point has always been technique if you look at the best players in europe they are always the ones who are technically excellent gyms and machines can never give you what keepy uppies and contact with the ball do for a child

6751887 insufficient and expensive power is a major barrier to nicaraguas economic growth
6751888 working with ifc will enable us to provide better more reliable power at a lower cost helping increase the countrys competitiveness and reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels
6751889 as the first ifc infraventures investment in the region el salto hydro underscores our commitment to promoting renewable energy as a viable alternative for improving access to power in developing countries
6751890 this investment reflects our commitment to the private sectors role in improving the quality and availability of power in nicaragua

6751892 outstanding examples of academic programs that are commonly linked to student success
6751893 the maricopa community colleges take very seriously the need to protect confidential student and employee information
6751894 we have no reason to believe that any unauthorized persons inappropriately disclosed misused or recorded any information or records in our system but wanted to notify those current and former students and employees whose information could have been viewed when our employee found this access point
6751895 this long and difficult transition has clearly taken a toll on the confidence of michigan residents
6751896 of course its hard to know what the future holds i believe the long term prospects for michigans economy are much brighter however in the next year or two our states economy is likely to stay fairly flat it doesnt help that the national economy is in a recession or at least a near recession
6751897 one of the most important aspects of this survey is its longevity
6751898 were able to look at a historical perspective and follow michigans up and downs i think its a huge asset from that standpoint alone
6751899 our priorities are clear diversification and sustainability we need to create an environment where the overall burden of work for businesses and the government is reduced creating more opportunities for a vibrant and competitive private sector azerbaijan has realized consistent economic reforms and we cooperate actively with ifc in promoting private sector development which is crucial for their implementation
6751900 a strong business environment is crucial for economic growth job creation and further investment in azerbaijan
6751901 working with ifc other countries in the region have reduced business formalities by more than a third this is also a realistic target that azerbaijan can achieve it will help the country become a leading reformer and remain attractive to national and foreign investors
6751902 guys with my experience dont do that well against guys like that

6751909 theres no way to see the future what will happen happens
6751910 but my work ethic my big heart my determination those are my strengths
6751911 heartened to learn that most voters dont buy into the spoiler argument being espoused by partisan talking heads thats how russell verney campaign manager for barr and former campaign manager for h ross perot puts it
6751912 people want real change and they know that they are not going to get it from a republican or a democrat verney says
6751913 americas only hope for change is by allowing more competition in the political process and that means opening the debates to any candidate who can meet the ballot access criteria
6751914 enough state ballots to have at least a mathematical chance of securing an electoral college majority in the 2008 general election
6751915 have a level of support of at least 15 percent of the national electorate as determined by five selected national public opinion polling organizations
6751916 this type of industry support certainly bolsters our belief that the time for the us bx is now
6751917 we are excited with the building momentum and look forward to announcing more developments in this important project

6751922 het is eigenlijk triest dat er in een welvaartsland als nederland mensen van de voedselbank moeten leven helaas is het zo voor de mensen in zulke omstandigheden kun je alleen maar respect opbrengen behalve dat dit voor ons gezin een leerzame ervaring is kunnen we hiermee ook aandacht vragen voor de voedselbank

6751951 the banking system in this country remains on a solid footing through the guarantees provided by fdic insurance the overwhelming majority of banks in this country are safe and sound and the chances that your own bank could fail are remote however if that does happen the fdic will be there as always to protect your insured deposits

6751959 the main sticking points in fact are also the most delicate setting a timeline for american troops to leave and declaring whether american forces would be granted immunity from iraqi prosecution
6751960 discussions are ongoing we have made some progress in the recent days on an agreement with the iraqis but there is no final agreement yet we will continue to have these discussions with the iraqis
6751961 so its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
6751962 its very premature at this point to say that we have an agreement
6751963 a flying visit to baghdad by dr rice which drew a scathing reaction from the anti us cleric hojatoleslam moqtada al sadr he accused washington of trying to pressure the iraqi authorities to bend to its will

6751965 saad hariri the leader of lebanons parliamentary majority visited iraq last month lebanon named an ambassador to iraq two years ago but he died and a replacement has not yet been chosen there is an iraqi embassy in beirut the capital of lebanon
6751966 we call for opening up the debates the scope of discussion must be as broad and deep as the serious challenges we face as a nation we agree that vibrant debate is the heart beat of our democracy and our first amendment especially during an election year we recognize that smaller third parties and independents have traditionally played a vital role in our democracy including leading the charge for the abolition of slavery the womens right to vote and economic justice for workers and farmers we support opening up the debates beyond the two parties and the so called commission on presidential debates which is a private corporation co chaired by former chairman of the republican and democratic parties its time for our presidential debates to once again be hosted by truly non partisan civic minded associations

6751998 our little joanne was one of the liveliest children in the street and was someone who was so full of beans she could not sit still for any moment of the day
6751999 she goes leaving a very large hole in our lives and her mum and dad and her sisters sarah and louise will keep her memory alive forever
6752000 i am quite sad at the demise of the print industry everyone here is very cheesed off
6752001 i had to sign the closure notice and tell people they were being made redundant and i am not very happy about it
6752002 very simply modern offices and technology completely eliminates the demand for print in the space of five years or so people have started doing it on their computer
6752003 and now this year with the apparent recession people are seeing how they can save money and i cant say i blame them
6752004 it the swastika is making the situation much more charged and that is so frustrating to those who have every right to be offended

6752024 es verdad que una gran cantidad de coleccionistas compran obras en galer as reconocidas porque saben que el galerista garantizar tanto la perennidad de la obra como el apoyo de su mercado pero tambi n existe una buena cantidad de coleccionistas en mi opini n la mayor a sobre todo entre los europeos que compran obras con las cuales desean vivir m s ac o m s all de cualquier consideraci n de mercado

6752095 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6752096 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6752097 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6752098 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6752099 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6752100 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6752101 if you trust every web site but not a government
6752102 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6752103 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6752104 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6752105 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6752106 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6752107 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6752108 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6752109 estamos trabalhando desde fevereiro em pareceres e outras atividades e s agora conseguimos votar
6752110 there is no greater sorrow on earth than the loss of ones native land
6752111 i was pained and angered by the atrocities against muslims worldwide and the turning point was the demolition of the babri masjid and the gujarat riots only made matters worse
6752112 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
6752113 all this talk about creation of indian mujahideen images needs to be probed i would not be surprised if such an organization has been floated by fundamentalist bodies like the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad with the sole intention of defaming muslims
6752114 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone but the manner adopted by the investigating agencies speaks of a blatant bias and a predetermined approach
6752115 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
6752116 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists
6752117 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
6752118 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists
6752119 we are excited about this opportunity to construct an on grid solar power plant in beijing which would be the first solar power plant we construct and operate

6752121 you do a great job im always informed energized and encouraged by your coverage youve got a reader for life
6752122 its the only dry way to get around its not like you can go jogging or anything
6752123 celebrities like lindsay lohan are merely gay for play and are attempting to cash in on the faddish appeal of lesbianism without any commitment to our cause
6752124 they never seem to move past the hand holding and eye gazing phase of the relationship
6752125 theres no sense these two are actually in a commited relationship if lindsay would come out and say shes gay and in a commited relationship with ronson then maybe she could use her media clout for good for the first time in her life
6752126 its the year of i kissed a girl for lohan and lots of other chicks out there when ronson dumps her shell just pick up the pieces and date a man
6752127 it may be typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement
6752128 but most americans have the humility and gratitude to respect and learn from the memories of men who suffered on behalf of others

6752131 the blues had a baby and they called it rock and roll
6752132 but by the same token we know these very same people are not interested in less religiosity in the political discourse they almost universally want a religious person as president
6752133 its not that they want to take religion out of politics its that their frustrations with the way things seem to be going are leading them to say well maybe churches should back off on this
6752134 is i have quite a comfortable career in england this is all upside i dont have to be too desperate

6752136 i read a lot of comedy scripts that shouldnt have been called comedy scripts

6752140 hes a loser that people want to succeed because his hearts in the right place
6752141 it celebrates diversity and puts a spring in peoples steps
6752142 it might behoove the mccain camp to point out their candidate belongs to the party that wants all americans to have a chance at living in a mansion
6752143 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6752144 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while

6752148 subsequently there were allegations that they did not have licensed bartenders on duty and that they had not purchased alcohol from a wholesaler
6752149 it appears that the establishment has become very popular as an after hours meeting place and a lot of those meetings are occurring outside in the parking area of surrounding businesses and the noise and the parking issues are in addition to the other violations that the city is aware of
6752150 it was the only thing that ever happened in terms of violence in our bar
6752151 the only complaints weve gotten are noise complaints so called by the neighbors we dont hear about them until it gets to a certain point where the police want to say something or webcrafters wants to say something
6752152 we tried to work with webcrafters who are our neighbors they pulled the parking lot from us saying their employees are in fear of their life
6752153 what they are in fear of their life from i dont know maybe because they see a whole bunch of minorities standing around in one spot and they get scared of that
6752154 our whole outlook is a community based restaurant where people can come in and feel comfortable they can feel at home they can make that community connection
6752155 i didnt want to pull the race card but ever since we opened this restaurant weve had problems with the police as well as everybody trying to knock us down
6752156 we did everything we were supposed to do it seems like no matter what we do there is always an issue
6752157 its no big deal to me they can come all they want theyd rather come at about 12 30 p m 1 a m compared to 2 p m in the afternoon or 4 p m in the afternoon they want to come when they feel they can show a presence
6752158 they are not going to be satisfied until we are out of this neighborhood and we are no longer in business that is their whole main goal
6752159 it is a minority issue it is a color issue
6752160 they can only go off that one issue because its the only issue thats happened here that and noise complaints so called
6752161 because you see a whole bunch of minorities standing around in one spot you think we are going to come and do a drive by do you think were going to come and pound your face in
6752162 we have rights too im not going to back down im going to fight
6752163 to get woken up at 5am to hear the car and trailer have gone is a big shock it has never happened to us before i know it does happen but it is one of those things you think will never happen to you

6752168 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
6752169 saying sorry was something mr rudd needed to say but he didnt quite say sorry for the right things
6752170 he said sorry to the stolen generation but he didnt say sorry to the huge disruption that gave birth to the stolen generation
6752171 reconciliation is a bitter joke which nobody is laughing at
6752172 it is not enough to say sorry we havent got to first base in saying sorry yet
6752173 we have to make ourselves listen instead of forever telling aboriginal people what is in their best interests
6752174 if we go to listen to them we will have to be patient because it wont come all at once it may take weeks before people begin to speak to us and the words they say we wont like

6752177 if there is no god to watch what you are doing then why should you be circumspect in your behavior certainly the germans at auschwitz who gassed samuel goldfein did not believe that god was watching them as berlinski points out that is the real problem with atheism
6752178 hence today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will of the almighty creator by defending myself against the jew i am fighting for the work of the lord
6752179 my feelings as a christian points me to my lord and savior as a fighter it points me to the man who once in loneliness surrounded by a few followers recognized these jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who gods truth was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter in boundless love as a christian and as a man i read through the passage which tells us how the lord at last rose in his might and seized the scourge to drive out of the temple the brood of vipers and adders how terrific was his fight for the world against the jewish poison to day after two thousand years with deepest emotion i recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that he had to shed his blood upon the cross as a christian i have no duty to allow myself to be cheated but i have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice and if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly it is the distress that daily grows for as a christian i have also a duty to my own people

6752261 the committee did not have an issue with the delta queen being a wooden superstructure
6752262 the seafarers international union represented crews on the delta queen under a contract with its former owner delta queen steamboat co joe ueberroth said that ended after ambassadors international which is nonunion bought the vessel last year as a result he said the union was lobbying against the waiver
6752263 in 2006 its interesting to know that the exemption to extend our operating permits did pass the house and at that time oberstar did vote for the exemption it wasnt until the control of congress and oberstar became the chair of the committee that the tone changed dramatically youve heard his statement that he says its due to safety but i look at the facts and i look at the facts that two things occurred from 2006 to 2007 one was a change in leadership in congress the second one was union opposition in all the previous attempts the unions never opposed this exemption they did in 2007 its a question weve asked ourselves why would a union fight against american jobs the one logical answer is that our company has been operating union free and previous companies operated with unions
6752264 senate commerce science and transportation chairman daniel inouye d hawaii also opposes the exemption mainly because the boat is not unionized he told majestic that he would not support the exemption unless the seafarers international union gets behind it majestic spokeswoman ann marie ricard said the company reached out to the union but didnt get an indication that it would be supportive of the exemption
6752265 joseph mccarthy general counsel for ambassadors international said the company had offered to let the union back on the delta queen in return for the unions support for the exemption but the union would not budge unless it was welcomed back onto all seven of majestics boats
6752266 first it is ludicrous and perhaps even slanderous to suggest that the siu or any other union either could or would guarantee congressional action on the proposed waiver that accusation is flat out false contrary to what has appeared in print and on line we indeed met with majestic america line to discuss the delta queen however our position simply was and remains that we make every effort to assist our contracted companies though certainly not at the expense of safety in this case we believed we potentially and we underscore potentially could help present a persuasive argument concerning the waiver because the siu has the only viable case for its continuation

6752416 i spoke to steve mcclaren a couple of times about it when he became the new coach i considered it quite strongly for a while but in the end i came to the conclusion that i had made the right decision in the first place and i didnt want to go back when steve was appointed he rang and asked me to return just the fact the england manager had rung and asked me to come back and play for my country meant a lot to me he didnt have to do that but he went out of his way to ring me and also came down to training and asked if i fancied it i did think about it but i dont really think i was ever that close that i would have said yes it wasnt about not thinking it was too much or i wasnt capable it was just the fact that when i was playing i wasnt enjoying it one little bit
6752417 i will carry on as long as i can as long as i feel i am still contributing to united i want to carry on
6752418 when i eventually stop then i will think about what i want to do from then on if i feel i can still be of worth i will carry on if not i will go i am sure the manager will say something as well if he turns round to me and says i am not doing enough anymore then fair enough that will be it it is part of life i dont worry about it you get too old and you cant do what you used to you have to accept it i am 34 in november and hope to still be playing at 35 anything after that if i am still playing well and doing something for the team then it will be a bonus

6752482 kein gegner ist einfach aber nach der ungl cklichen niederlage gegen die austria z hlt nur ein sieg
6752483 ich denke dass unsere spieler den gegner ried ernst nehmen und wir drei punkte holen werden
6752484 wir werden uns sicher nicht 90 minuten hinten reinstellen und den ball nach vorne dreschen unser ziel ist ein tor zu schie en
6752485 ich habe sehr positive erinnerungen an mattersburg was ich dort an emotionen von den fans erlebt habe habe ich sonst nirgends erlebt

6752489 es ist schwierig einen sieg zu verlangen aber man kann verlangen dass man von der ersten sekunde an alles versucht das ziel die drei punkte einzufahren
6752490 f r k rnten haben wir uns auch etwas spezielles einfallen lassen

6752499 the positive things about the website include it is very easy to navigate through the different products and product categories it is easy to shop the way it is divided into the categories on the left the other great thing is you offer free items ideas and contests i also like that you try to capture the shopper with a newsletter sign up that is good for thecustomer as well as for the company to obtain information and remind them of great things you have so they will return to your site

6752505 di politik terjadi krisis kepercayaan dari politisi dan elit politik ketika lembaga lembaga individu individu dimata masyarakat sudah hancur citranya mereka tengah kehabisan akal untuk mengembalikan citra itu akhirnya salah satu upayanya ya menggandeng para artis itu artis itu hanya dijadikan manekin politik bumper dan semacam pita penghias rambut secara substansial kita belum bisa menemukan artis yang memiliki gagasan politik yang menjadikan mereka bisa diandalkan
6752506 bandingkan saja dulu masyarakat menganggap dunia politik itu sesuatu yang mengerikan karena dulu politik dikuasai suatu rezim tapi sekarang ada kesadaran politik yang tinggi
6752507 artis masuk ke politik sah sah saja tapi kalau jadi fenomena dan banyaknya artis yang tiba tiba menjadi politisi patut dicurigai ini akan menurunkan citra politik itu sendiri
6752508 saya tetap meragukan artis yang menjadi politisi survei dan evaluasi yang saya lakukan belum ada bukti artis yang berhasil menjadi politisi kalau mereka menjadi politisi hanya mengandalkan popularitas mau dibawa kemana negara ini

6752510 some hit is going to come from existing preferred shareholders
6752511 theres not protection for shareholders of common or preferred shares
6752512 while some companies will probably have some writedowns i dont think theres a widespread effect on the whole industry
6752513 we found out that wall street has been king of a nudist beach
6752514 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6752515 i dont agree with many of the conclusions in the movie

6752519 adapting video content for mobiles has traditionally been difficult due to wide variations in device capabilities
6752520 im thrilled to see mobizoft join the growing number of companies providing bulk data to deviceatlas mobizoft brings unique capabilities in regards to media streaming which is at the cutting edge of the mobile web deviceatlas users will benefit tremendously from mobizofts innovation
6752521 we are constantly working to improve the experience of developing mobile web video broadcasting and advertising which is often made difficult by the variety and capabilities of devices
6752522 in working with dotmobi we are able to provide deviceatlas users with information for creating rich mobile content for nearly every video capable device on the planet
6752523 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that has been kind of a nudist beach
6752524 what were seeing in business in our retail businesses or anything having to do with housing is even a further slowing down in june and july both in terms of credit experience where people first got in trouble with house payments and now credit card payments
6752525 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6752526 that doesnt mean that the equity cant get wiped out and it almost has in a practical sense as institutions they dont have any net worth people who own their insured mortgages or own their debt nothing is going to happen to them the equity and preferred stock is another question
6752527 well whose party broke it in the first place or even denied that it existed
6752528 former hilldale high school band director and the school have been ordered to pay 2 7 million to a student the teacher had sex with
6752529 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6752530 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6752531 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6752532 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6752533 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6752534 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6752535 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6752536 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6752537 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6752538 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6752539 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6752540 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6752541 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6752542 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6752543 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6752544 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6752545 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6752546 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6752547 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6752548 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6752549 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6752550 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6752551 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6752552 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6752553 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6752554 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6752555 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6752556 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6752557 all comedy should be silly come on youre not angry six formers
6752558 if somebody thinks that people will be satisfied after musharrafs removal let me tell you that people want the rule of law
6752559 wednesday should not be considered the final word there could be a delay of a day or two but you will see results in a week or so
6752560 if somebody thinks that people will be satisfied after musharrafs removal let me tell you that people want the rule of law
6752561 wednesday should not be considered the final word there could be a delay of a day or two but you will see results in a week or so
6752562 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6752563 los mexicanos de cemex han sido irrespetuosos ellos en el fondo tienen complejo de superioridad son tan latinos como nosotros pero se sienten m s del norte
6752564 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6752565 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6752566 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6752567 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6752568 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6752569 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6752570 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6752571 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6752572 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6752573 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6752574 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6752575 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6752576 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6752577 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6752578 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6752579 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6752580 its the only dry way to get around its not like you can go jogging or anything
6752581 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6752582 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6752583 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6752584 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6752585 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6752586 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6752587 es war eine nicht immer einfache zeit aber wir haben es geschafft wir haben uns in der branche einen namen gemacht
6752588 wir sind am wachsen und das soll die n chste zeit noch anhalten
6752589 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6752590 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6752591 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6752592 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6752593 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6752594 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6752595 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6752596 who are open to doing something on the production side
6752597 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6752598 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6752599 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6752600 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6752601 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6752602 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6752603 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6752604 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6752605 i am not the tool of the worlds sole superpower
6752606 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6752607 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6752608 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6752609 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6752610 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6752611 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6752612 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6752613 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6752614 streaming a full album is a first for gannett so we are thrilled to be working with capitol records and a musician of brian wilsons stature to deliver music in a new way to our online audiences this positions us well to expand our digital platforms while demonstrating the power of gannett to deliver quality content across a network of websites
6752615 this music is really special to me and i hope that everyone will enjoy it

6752620 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6752621 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6752622 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6752623 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6752624 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6752625 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6752626 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6752627 endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
6752628 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6752629 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6752630 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6752631 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6752632 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6752633 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6752634 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6752635 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6752636 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6752637 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6752638 if you trust every web site but not a government
6752639 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6752640 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6752641 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6752642 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6752643 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6752644 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6752645 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6752646 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition

6752700 anticancer research is aimed at understanding the molecular pathways hat can be selectively targeted to halt tumor growth
6752701 we know that the mtor pathway is activated in many cancers and therefore is a good target for fighting a wide array of tumors
6752702 we analyzed tissue from human biopsies as well as cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer
6752703 this study inserts a new piece of information into the puzzle of the effects of mtorc1 inhibitors in cell signaling
6752704 furthermore because there are inhibitors of mapk pathway already approved for the treatment of cancer it provides us with the rationale for using combinations of mtorc1 and mapk inhibitors in attacking tumors thereby offering cancer patients another treatment option with immediate applicability

6752770 there is one thing that i can confirm without breaking any nda the iphone is hands down without a doubt the single most powerful mobile development platform ever
6752771 whether the platform will see enterprise adoption or whether it will remain plagued by people making 2 flashlights time will only tell
6752772 that wont change the fact that the capabilities provided by the iphone and the ease with which developers can tap into those capabilities is simply unprecedented this is easily reflected by the fact that from what i hear the iphone app store is selling like 1 000 000 per day of applications

6752801 reconciliation is a bitter joke which nobody is laughing at
6752802 it is not enough to say sorry we havent got to first base in saying sorry yet
6752803 we have to make ourselves listen instead of forever telling aboriginal people what is in their best interests
6752804 if we go to listen to them we will have to be patient because it wont come all at once it may take weeks before people begin to speak to us and the words they say we wont like
6752805 this definitely is an ongoing concern its not something that were all just gonna chuck away again
6752806 looking back i dont think we had to be so blunt and alright were splitting up really we shouldve just chilled out for a bit and taken some time out to be honest
6752807 but obviously we all had a deep yearning inside to get back to do this or it wouldnt have happened i just hope we dont split up again now cause it becomes a bit silly doesnt it
6752808 its gonna be towards the end of this year or the beginning of the new one

6752818 los medios sienten tal necesidad de ofrecer datos constantemente que a veces no distinguen entre informaci n real e informaci n basura
6752819 algunos periodistas se quejaban por no poder tomar im genes en el interior del centro hospitalario o presionaban para que los partes fueran le dos por el m dico responsable
6752820 pero muchas veces cae en el amarillismo y la falta de respeto
6752821 varios periodistas realizaran ayer un d a despu s del accidente el mismo vuelo que el avi n siniestrado para escribir un reportaje basado en las declaraciones de los pasajeros
6752822 suele ser correcto aunque a veces caen en el amarillismo
6752823 en estos momentos se ve lo mejor y lo peor del periodismo al mismo tiempo
6752824 lo mejor de esta cobertura ha sido que todos los medios se han volcado con la informaci n del accidente y esto contribuir a dinamizar el proceso
6752825 existe un dispositivo medi tico muy potente que permite seguir los acontecimientos en tiempo real por lo que podemos decir que
6752826 la necesidad de suministrar datos constantemente genera informaci n sensacionalista e irrespetuosa
6752827 as lograr amos compatibilizar la informaci n constante con el respeto a los familiares y las v ctimas
6752828 no debe fomentarse el culto a la emoci n ni la espectacularizaci n de la informaci n
6752829 el presupuesto ampliado es para poder cubrir todas esas necesidades extras que se van gestando a lo largo del a o tiene que ver con promoci n de proyectos para el p blico infantil para los j venes creadores y con trayectoria hay una comunidad muy grande que est esperando el apoyo

6752838 regrets are a waste of time theyre just the past crippling you in the present

6752840 unthinkably good things can happen even late in the game its such a surprise
6752841 they built tracks over the alps to connect venice and vienna they built the track before there was even a train in existence that could make the trip they built the tracks because they knew the train would come

6752844 yea the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming but my people know not the judgment of the lord
6752845 we will all verily abide by the will of god
6752846 glory be unto thee o my god verily this thy servant and this thy maidservant have gathered under the shadow of thy mercy and they are united through thy favor and generosity o lord assist them in this thy world and thy kingdom and destine for them every good through thy bounty and grace o lord confirm them in thy servitude and assist them in thy service suffer them to become the signs of thy name in thy world and protect them through thy bestowals which are inexhaustible in this world and the world to come o lord they are supplicating the kingdom of thy mercifulness and invoking the realm of thy singleness verily they are married in obedience to thy command cause them to become the signs of harmony and unity until the end of time verily thou art the omnipotent the omnipresent and the almighty
6752847 today the human world is in need of a great power by which these glorious principles and purposes may be executed the cause of peace is a very great cause it is the cause of god and all the forces of the world are opposed to it governments for instance consider militarism as the step to human progress that division among men and nations is the cause of patriotism and honor that if one nation attack and conquer another gaining wealth territory and glory thereby this warfare and conquest this bloodshed and cruelty are the cause of that victorious nations advancement and prosperity this is an utter mistake compare the nations of the world to the members of a family a family is a nation in miniature simply enlarge the circle of the household and you have the nation enlarge the circle of nations and you have all humanity the conditions surrounding the family surround the nation the happenings in the family are the happenings in the life of the nation would it add to the progress and advancement of a family if dissensions should arise among its members fighting pillaging each other jealous and revengeful of injury seeking selfish advantage nay this would be the cause of the effacement of progress and advancement so it is in the great family of nations for nations are but an aggregate of families therefore as strife and dissension destroy a family and prevent its progress so nations are destroyed and advancement hindered
6752848 the far reaching detrimental effects of family decline especially on children were long denied in many leading intellectual circles
6752849 conventional two parent household may be far less critical to the healthy development of children than previously believed
6752850 the divorce revolution has failed it has created terrible hardships for children incurred unsupportable social costs and failed to deliver on its promise of greater adult happiness the time has come to shift the focus of national attention from divorce to marriage
6752851 a powerful consensus has emerged in recent years among social scientists as well as state and federal policy makers it sees single parent families as the dismal foundries that produced decades of child poverty delinquency and crime and it views the rise of such families as a singularly important indicator of child pathology
6752852 i didnt think that it was a good message to be sending out
6752853 i think all of us feel that family values have to sort of come back front and center
6752854 strong families remain essential for a strong and healthy society and irreplaceable for successful child rearing and for satisfying the deeper social emotional needs of both adults and children this fact leads one to think that perhaps future generations of americans will want to make a cultural shift back in the direction of two parent families held together by lifelong marriage it is hard to envision this scenario in the very near future but over the course of the next twenty years signs of this change could become evident and the scenario will surely become more likely if the nation becomes better educated about the evidence relating family weakening to the host of problems that ail modern societies especially those concerning our children

6752857 this convention our largest ever demonstrated that young people care passionately about and propose solutions to the issues that ultimately affect us all education fair pay and climate change
6752858 we call on the government to introduce legislation to reduce the voting age to 16 and allow thousands more young people who want to exercise a right to vote to do so
6752859 the convention delegates were enthusiastic passionate and inspiring and the decision by the council to prioritise votes at 16 is a major boost to the campaign and to the coalition of other key organisations and political parties who already support it
6752860 the british youth council is an organisation led and run by young people elected to a board of trustees we support young people to have a voice and be heard
6752861 i believe the votes at 16 campaign is what byc is fundamentally about as were a youth organisation committed to giving more young people a voice
6752862 i recently spent three hours on the streets of london talking to the public about this issue and i collected 90 postcards to send to gordon brown calling for a reduction in the voting age so im personally aware of growing support for votes at 16 amongst the general public
6752863 empirical surveys on the international egrc market are rare so this report is welcome and timely the market knows the quality of gartners work across different technology sectors and the magic quadrant has become a de facto guide as to where individual vendors stand naturally therefore we are delighted that we have come out as the only european headquartered challenger to the current international status quo we are confident with the recent rapid growth of sword achievers representation across the globe that our position will improve further by the time the next review of the market is conducted

6752868 its a false economy to do without travel insurance and it should be regarded as a holiday essential
6752869 travel insurance can cover cancellations lost cash and valuables and emergency medical treatment
6752870 while such events are always stressful travelling with insurance gives some peace of mind to holidaymakers that they will not be left stranded abroad without cash or facing potentially large hospital bills if they fall ill or are injured

6752915 pour la russie il est actuellement tr s avantageux de reconna tre ces r publiques il sagirait certainement de la plus grande victoire du pays en politique trang re ces derni res ann es mais il ne faut pas oublier que cette reconnaissance frapperait s v rement les int r ts commerciaux de notre lite politique en occident ces gens se prononcent activement contre la reconnaissance cest pourquoi elle prendra s rement plusieurs ann es

6752928 whilst the deadline has passed for miners to lodge claims there are still many claims awaiting settlement some of which may take up to two years before a successful conclusion is reached therefore the site is still critical for solicitors to continue to track the progress of any outstanding claims it is now updated by capita who administer the services for berr providing information such as requests for more health information for each miner progress on claims and the details of the claims settlements
6752929 the big challenge for the team here at wtg was that we were dealing with a service coming close to the end of its lifecycle we had to deal with end users of the site who were used to the way it works but were migrating from entering claims to their management through the process of settlement the fact that we are able to ensure that the servers and software are supported and maintained for the life of the project while ensuring that solicitors can still access the information for their clients means that we were able to deliver against objective and budget

6752940 there is one thing that i can confirm without breaking any nda the iphone is hands down without a doubt the single most powerful mobile development platform ever
6752941 whether the platform will see enterprise adoption or whether it will remain plagued by people making 2 flashlights time will only tell
6752942 that wont change the fact that the capabilities provided by the iphone and the ease with which developers can tap into those capabilities is simply unprecedented this is easily reflected by the fact that from what i hear the iphone app store is selling like 1 000 000 per day of applications

6752946 whats really going on here is that there is a huge burgeoning community of iphone developers and they are positively begging for community
6752947 they want to be able to talk to each other help each other learn from each other and have some place where they can go for support and to hone their skills
6752948 now this is one of the greatest secrets which god has revealed to mortal and fallible man it is a miracle and a marvel of god an arcanum above all arcana and deserves to be kept secret until the last of times when there shall be nothing hidden but all things shall be manifest and although up to this time it has not been known to men it was nevertheless known to the wood sprites and nymphs and giants long ago because they themselves were sprung from this source since from such homunculi when they come to manhood are produced giants pygmies and other marvelous people who get great victories over their enemies and know all secrets and hidden matters

6752973 antes de irme a la selecci n robinho estaba bien hoy he llegado y trabajado con l y he visto que tambi n lo estaba pero es una situaci n particular de robinho y el club ambos tiene que decidir lo mejor para el madrid

6752980 people who have been limited on their water supply within the city will soon not have to worry about such issues
6752981 the pipeline attaches the al rasheed water treatment plant to the water tower in mahmudiyah in order to bring potable water to the city
6752982 this is a shared project between coalition forces and the iraqi government
6752983 the local water director came to us and identified demand for water in mahmudiyah as well as excess supply in al rasheed we provided the pipe and the goi is providing the funding for the installation testing and connection of the pipe everything but the pipe itself
6752984 the government of iraq did the technical piece of the project so that it was completed to their standards and their specifications
6752985 if you train and mentor young local leaders their individual accomplishments will instill confidence to build cities and neighborhoods without the assistance from coalition forces
6752986 hasta el ltimo momento intentamos convencer a la parte georgiana de no tomar ese rumbo desde el principio dijimos que ese conflicto no puede resolverse por la fuerza

6752988 vemos la destrucci n de la infraestructura civil y los llamamientos de diversos pol ticos a cambiar el gobierno democr ticamente elegido de georgia por eso es por lo que consideramos que rusia ha ido demasiado lejos

6752996 nor do we have any exact dates for the disturbances
6752997 ten thousand people have been arrested since march we dont know where they are being held

6753056 he turned toward me and put his index finger out and started pounding me in the chest saying you know my position on this and how dare you ask me about this and you are just trying to intimidate me
6753057 we investigated it so thoroughly beyond any expectation you might have i can tell you
6753058 i dont think this story is anything like the way theyve portrayed it i think this guy chose to do this
6753059 given the site of the attack he was making a political statement
6753060 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world

6753079 we hope this study can be translated into applications to help treat or prevent obesity
6753080 brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain in the body
6753081 for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect

6753084 you know what i mean whenever leon is exhausted you just yell at him to keep going
6753085 he needs to help us he cant be treated like a child
6753086 nor can you treat him like he has an inhuman amount of energy hes only seventeen and the null takes a lot of his energy to pilot
6753087 sakura dear hes going to be okay hes just very tired
6753088 umm maria do you think me and leon could get a moment alone
6753089 sure dear but dont take too long leon still needs some rest
6753090 i guess i guess that i felt that i had to contribute more that i needed to help more especially for my poor performance during the other two missions
6753091 well you cant blame yourself it looks like that piloting the null takes a lot of your energy
6753092 yea it makes me tired easily even flying takes a lot of my energy i just feel like that im no use to everyone if i have to leave the battlefield early
6753093 this is the worst its been the last two times i didnt need any medical help but it makes me so pissed that rob just yells at me all the time he doesnt understand how tired i get or how much it hurts
6753094 hes stabilized sakura is in there talking to him its quite strange ive never seen sakura act that way
6753095 so youve noticed too it is strange before this she hardly ever smiled nor would she show any other emotion i thought it had to do with her being a war orphan
6753096 that may be one of the reasons but leon and her seem to be getting along quite well but he may just be that one
6753097 i just think that i could do so much more but i dont know what i can do
6753098 leon youre doing what you do best but you just think that you need to do so much more
6753099 en af grundene til at vi ikke var med i titelkapl bet i sidste s son var at vi spillede uafgjort p hjem mebane for tit vi kan ikke s tte s mange point til hjemme i denne s son hvis vi vil v re med fremme

6753101 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6753102 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6753103 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals

6753350 i always told myself i would never not finish a race and its hard to describe how i feel having to pull out i was sick on the bike and every time i took on fluids i was sick again its not great when youre sick down your arms and legs and its the worst thing when everyone is cheering you on and you cant keep going i ruined my new white shoes and when i finished the third lap i pulled over
6753351 i didnt feel awesome but i stayed in good tactical position on the swim and the bike ride so of there were any breaks id be in good position but i didnt have any legs when it came to the run

6753407 it was a fantastic race probably the most enjoyable race i have ever had and i am really pleased not just for me but for my coach friends and family who have given me so much support
6753408 mum took me down to the local canoe club when i was 10 and i loved it so much i never looked back
6753409 she supported me all the way and it was a huge regret that she didnt live long enough to see me win the world championships last year
6753410 i went to her grave and left the flowers they gave me for winning it was an emotional moment for me now the focus is on getting that prized gold medal im determined to do it and it will be dedicated to her
6753411 the gameplay is addictive leaving plenty of room for experimenting with tons of cool moves and fighting styles theres even some replay value here seeing as you can always return and complete the game using a different difficulty mode and revisit secret missions you werent able to finish first time around

6753419 they screamed for money and the more i tried to tell them that the money is in the office the more they screamed
6753420 he kept on demanding money saying if i did not give him money he would shoot and kill me
6753421 i was not going to let them kill me i knew if i did not do anything they might kill me
6753422 it is frustrating because i want to do so many things but now i have no choice

6753425 dropping a baton isnt bad luck its bad execution responsibility for the relay debacle lies with many people and many groups from administration to coaches to athletes thats why when these games are completed we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programs
6753426 we could win the gold medal in every single track and field event but if we dont win a single thing in the sprints and relays the public will view our performance as a disaster
6753427 when we drop the baton in back to back relay races the public views our performance as a disaster

6753434 when i did my first album i said that when i did a second i wanted gary to write for me i think he is a great songwriter one of britains best songwriters i love take that so it was always a dream of mine that hed write for me
6753435 he said it was fantastic i hope in future gary will play when i sing
6753436 when i was contacted by bryn about performing at the festival i said i would like whoever won the nancy role to sing in concert with me
6753437 i think its important that we help promote the people we choose to win i backed jodie really quietly for the whole time as i really believed in her when people see her do other things they will realise what a star she really is
6753438 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
6753439 but this year i hadnt finalised my schedule for torchwood so i told them to make sure i could have time off to do it
6753440 torchwood has really reached out to audiences worldwide and the fact its moved up the channels on the bbc is incredible
6753441 we moved from cardiff bay to the beach i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here
6753442 i love the people and the place we decided to have our civil partnership in cardiff and the response we got from people was unbelievable our neighbours in sully are wonderful i feel at home here
6753443 we have a house in london because we still work in london but our main house is in wales
6753444 i never want to be pigeon holed im an entertainer whether im entertaining a teenage girl whos watching me judging on a tv show a young guy watching doctor who or a couple watching torchwood the fact i can diversify is great
6753445 ooh i dont know you will have to watch they are talking about it i would like to see a year hiatus before theres another one you need to put a pause on something when you have such a good thing going rather than flog it like a dead horse
6753446 it was the highest rated show on the bbc that evening ive had a huge response to people saying theyre more open minded now
6753447 teenagers have written to me and said theyre more comfortable with coming out now some were on the brink of suicide but changed their minds im really pleased with that
6753448 theres nothing wrong with who i am or being gay and i wanted people to see that there are always people who wont like me but all i ask is people respect me

6753457 i think well eventually settle into a three piece with an occasional fourth but i used to think we could never do it with less than five but its sounding really good right now and it makes me think about the songs in a different way
6753458 because that usually means it sucks or its pretentious but i had this idea to make it like an opera with a lot of similar lyrics throughout i wanted to have songs that answered other songs questions this one is dark but not relationship dark this is a lot about snapshots about growing up in the midwest about religion in the south i wanted the album to be cohesive i wanted it to be like a record one that people would listen to from beginning to end
6753459 i feel like if people are patient with the record
6753460 theyll get the payoff there are a lot of songs that start slow but then get bigger after part of this is me being my typical obstinate self im not going to give you that without some work im a pretty patient listener so maybe that has translated to me being a more patient songwriter
6753461 i held her for an instant but my arms felt sure and strong it only takes a moment to be loved a whole life long
6753462 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6753463 this lack of knowledge of provider conscience law within the health professions can be detrimental to conscience and other rights particularly for individuals and entities with moral objections to abortion and other medical procedures
6753464 the proposed regulations and secretary leavitts public comments about them leave the door open as to whether institutions and individuals can deny access to contraception
6753465 while the rules are not identical to the draft proposal being circulated by hhs last month the agency interprets existing conscientious objection laws so broadly that it could result in women not receiving information they need to make informed healthcare decisions
6753466 it undermines the doctor patient relationship because women will now have to question whether their health care providers are giving them complete and unbiased information and the best care possible
6753467 t he issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6753468 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement

6753538 while the university appreciates this recognition formulaic rankings offer an inconsistent and often inaccurate picture of what individual colleges offer students which is one reason many institutions dont rely on rankings to inform students about the educational and social opportunities we provide
6753539 for example this past year princeton further improved its exceptional financial aid program and improved the quality of its undergraduate offerings especially in the arts
6753540 we are pleased to be acknowledged as one of the nations best universities and we remain dedicated to demonstrating to interested students and their families the many ways we continue to improve the princeton experience every year
6753541 while many students consider ranking guides when selecting a university it is important to note that no ranking can capture whether a school is the best choice for an individual student

6753571 im very pleased with the work ethic of this young group
6753572 i believe that they have focused on the things we asked them to work on when we sent them home for the summer now it is up to both golfers and coaches to forge the confidence necessary to compete at this level
6753573 they are all talented players but when youre young sometimes you lack that confidence that you need my biggest task beyond the technical aspects of the game will be to continue to pull that confidence out of them as we progress through the season
6753574 we should be able to improve upon some things from last year
6753575 we are competitive now and are working on improving every day i feel like this team is one that if we do the right things early on can reach some high expectations later on we need to get them to feel confident and that is something we will work on all year
6753576 what i try and impart upon my players is that as long as they are working hard in practice sticking to the process for improvement they should never be disappointed in themselves
6753577 big burly guys come up to us and say we couldnt do what you do
6753578 it generates a lot of interest because people have a lot of questions

6753594 dream is to create a space for youth and families to gather safely and have some fun
6753595 our playground is not the only one in the area
6753596 but what makes it distinct is that young people from different political colors fatah hamas or pflp factions come almost every day not to talk about politics but to practice sports with each other other playgrounds attract only those who are affiliated with a certain political line
6753597 there is an increase in rage amongst the youth as a result of infighting and lawlessness that have recently taken place in the gaza strip
6753598 the result is a retreat from the basic values of good citizenship democracy participation and humanitarian action all replaced by the exchange of accusations and violent actions
6753599 forty six international human rights workers are now sailing to gaza through international waters with one overriding goal to break the israeli siege that israel has imposed on the civilian population of gaza

6753605 it is not mans better nature but his self interest that demands that he be his brothers keeper
6753606 alinsky understated the degree to which peoples hopes and dreams and their ideals and their values were just as important in organizing as peoples self interest
6753607 it appears shameful to admit that we operate on the basis of naked self interest so we desperately try to reconcile every shift of circumstances that is to our self interest in terms of a broad moral justification or rationalization
6753608 self respect arises only out of people who play an active role in solving their own crises and who are not helpless passive puppet like recipients of private or public services

6753642 bahan skripsi ini banyak dikasih oleh temanku seorang cewek anak jurusan psikologi dia frustrasi ditolak oleh orang orang gay yang madu dia jadikan objek penelitian makanya bahannya dikasih ke aku banyak studi literatur darinya
6753643 anak cewek itu bikin percakapan awal yang sangat blunder mas saya mahasiswi yang hendak bikin penelitian tentang gay
6753644 karena sudah sejak awal belum kenal kok ngomong gay bagaimana kamu tahu kalau mereka gay cap gay buat mereka dari orang luar yang belum kenal sangat menyinggung kecuali kalau kamu sudah kenal dekat
6753645 oh mungkin karena itu yah waktu aku wawancara aku ngomong langsung bilang gay atau homoseksual narasumberku mencak mencak
6753646 bedanya waria sudah tuntas tahap psikologisnya sehingga mereka berani tampil seperti wanita kalau gay masih terkendala sehingga memilih diam diam di tengah masyarakat
6753647 jangan salah loh mereka lari paling cepat kalau dikejar aparat
6753648 sebabnya macam macam ada yang sejak kecil ditinggal pergi ayahnya dia rindu sosok seorang ayah begitu dewasa dan menemukan seorang pria yang dia anggap dapat menggantikan profil ayahnya dia bisa tertarik ada juga karena orang tuanya menghendaki dia terlahir jadi wanita orang tua mendambakan anak perempuan karena sudah punya anak laki laki bahkan orang tua tak sengaja memaksa dia dengan berbagai perlakuan dibeliin rok lah segala macam tapi ada juga faktor budaya homoseksual bukan fenomena modern dia sudah ada sejak dulu bahkan dalam masyarakat kita sendiri dan warga menerimanya baik baik saja

6753672 going to one of the bunkers to process this margo be back soon
6753673 i see your point margo starr ann isnt about to let us go trekking off into someplace she deems dangerous
6753674 weve gotta get into her head gotta think like starr ann
6753675 takes a brave woman to try a thing like that
6753676 maybe shell send us off on an exotic vacation somewhere an olivia cruise
6753677 hell no thatd leave all the chores on both ranches for starr ann to do all by herself plus you know how nosy starr ann can be no way is she about to send us off where she cant snoop around on whether were re bonding or not
6753678 it was just an observation not an accusation more amaretto
6753679 youre definitely buzzed i can tell because youre starting to speak in clich s and youre reinforcing the first one with a second one
6753680 youre off the mark jodie totally out of the money here
6753681 you might as well stay here tonight margo trickster and amelia get along so well and ill bet theyve already bedded down out there beside the hay roll
6753682 moons up by now and its fairly large tonight lets take a moonlight walk to the pasture and surprise those two with some carrots
6753683 hey starr ann see you have the clipboard this should be fun
6753684 printed out a few graphs here margo found something innerestin about your writing lately
6753685 ive graphed the number of times you mention jodie against time and found a shocking drop off in jodie related posts over the last few months
6753686 you know as well as i do starr ann that jodies been working her heart out on that book being totally meticulous about documenting the bush administrations atrocities here in the last months of the regime
6753687 i do know that and i also know youve made it a point to stand back and give jodie and me time alone whenever she does come up for air
6753688 here we have a histogram that clearly shows youve been doing that over roughly the same period of time as the jodie deficient posts
6753689 you saw yesterday where lori posted her spreadsheet of moving didnt you starr ann
6753690 you saw that spreadsheet and just couldnt stand it what else have you got charted there in that stack of papers
6753691 nothing much now margo what are we going to do about your estrangement from jodie
6753692 what else would you call it can you even remember the last time you sat down to a meal with jodie the last time you put up fencing with her the last time you saddled up trickster and rode over to her house to see if shed like to hop on amelia and go for a ride the last time you ganged up with her and made fun of me while im listening to music
6753693 stop right there starr ann we were not making fun we were sharing how much we love you
6753694 i sure do remember the last time i was all alone with jodie in this barn in the biblical sense
6753695 that was an anomalous data point that i had to exclude from my reports here believe me i tried to work it into something but like i said anomalous
6753696 so what do we have to do in response to your findings starr ann
6753697 just tell me and get it over with starr ann
6753698 all i need you to do is fill out these forms ive made up
6753699 answer from your gut not your brain and when youre finished ill apply your parameters to a little algorithm ive written after that i should be able to tell you what were gonna do about this

6753705 and shes going to be around for a while longer
6753706 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6753707 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6753708 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6753709 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6753710 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6753711 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6753712 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6753713 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6753714 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
6753715 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream

6753727 well if this isnt about as rigged up as as a no bid contract to service iraqs oilfields
6753728 starr ann you i suspected but destiny jane you flatter me no end woman
6753729 just trying to keep the tire hydrated margo why look at these other three
6753730 poor things are driern the dust on a desert rats sombrero
6753731 every time i see that hole im going to think of you
6753732 that had to be the stupidest exit line anybody ever came up with
6753733 it wasnt an exit line an exit line is when she isnt coming back dont worry destiny janell definitely be back
6753734 nope aint any more stuck than a six inch shovel in two inches of dry dirt
6753735 now my trucks about as stuck as a full grown hummingbird in a baby bullfrogs throat if thats what youre talkin about
6753736 um yeah i meant your truck anyway my names margo moon happy to be of any help you might need
6753737 did evel knievel know how to pop a wheelie question is do i have a jack
6753738 well i guess the only thing to do here is get you back to happy hands ranch and see about fetching a jack that wont slip in all this mud you hungry
6753739 destiny jane cavanaugh this is my best friend starr ann
6753740 unless youre in a hurry probably be best to wait until that mud hardens up before trying to jack your truck up youre welcome to stay here for the night and i bet things dry out by tomorrow
6753741 im no more hurried than a jackrabbit in two acres of carrots on a sunny day in july
6753742 perfect now lets go see what jodies cooking for breakfast
6753743 might as well ask how it happens that userid destinyjane88green was already taken on yahoo
6753744 hate to rush off from such nice company destiny jane but were already about as late as a pregnancy clause in a contract full of loopholes
6753745 about as spoken for as a slice of fruitcake on a platter full of sugar cookies and im as tall as you are
6753746 well just so happens i prefer fruitcake and i bet yall make it with bourbon here in kentucky for that nice bite i like so much
6753747 since the moons fairly new tonightll be a good dark one for testing some equipment in my bunkers be happy to have your company and show them to you destiny if that sounds inviting
6753748 sounds about as inviting as flute music noodling down a holler in the green lighting right before a downpour
6753749 then well head out soon as supper dishes are done
6753750 youre starting to talk like destiny jane you know that starr ann
6753751 margo sometimes you make about as much sense as clothes on a cartoon character
6753752 youre telling me you havent noticed anything about how destiny jane talks
6753753 well sure i hear a trace of indiana accent but its not that much different from ours
6753754 okay starr ann then let me ask you this did destiny jane mention anything about how long she can afford to be stuck here
6753755 be cause starr ann id like nothing better than for it to rain real hard for about a week to keep that truck right where it is if you get my drift
6753756 dang guess ive been as dense as an oil executive testifying before congress about record profits
6753757 girlfriend theyre four percentin us to death just to death
6753758 well they have to save up andrew can you imagine the gas money its gonna take to get all those buses back to south carolina they might have to end up skimping on beer
6753759 hi im a vegetarian who loves women praise the lord and you im guessing carnivorous fornicator
6753760 okay champ heres how this assignment is going to be run from now on you give me a daily schedule and i tell you at what points during it you call in i may have let you logic your way into this scheme but if i have to sit here and worry about you every minute for the next four or five weeks youre cancelled
6753761 youre right chloe how about i fill you in on what im up to right now then later this evening ill email a tentative schedule for tomorrow it will have to be tentative but ill really try to stick to it
6753762 on my way to the cabin of get this a woman hermit
6753763 one of the earlier ones was committed on her property for one thing and she lives relatively near the restaurant where i ate lunch shell make as good a starting point as any
6753764 a little ive started hiking again and am on a fairly sharp incline
6753765 you have the concept of hermit right very few of the real ones live in condos
6753766 i cant wait to hear this story betcha twenty dollars her legs havent seen a razor in ages
6753767 youre on i just hope shell talk to me about the shootings tell you one thing since i stepped onto her land i havent passed a single spot where a fresh posted sign isnt visible she definitely has strong feelings about people hunting her wildlife
6753768 mmm she either wants it all for herself or shes an animal lover or shes some kind of religious freak
6753769 im on the net and a search for female hermit brings up a lot of religious fanatics heres one saint who it says stayed alive by eating a single bushel of lentils over the course of 17 years
6753770 hairy legs lentil breath and very skinny sounds cute anyway her name is faye carson and her place is at the end of a county road mill creek road this phone is starting to break up chloe want to say goodbye for now
6753771 ms carson im a journalist with the toronto courier my newspaper is covering the hunter murders that have been occurring here i understand one of them took place on your property
6753772 well yes a lady named delia over at the teakway eatery said it was i believe the third one
6753773 maybe the third im sure anyone from this area could be of more help to you than i
6753774 sure if i were after gossip and local theory which ill get my share of during the next few weeks without asking for it but something tells me you might have a unique perspective on the facts and the issues involved here the amount of time you must spend keeping your property so thoroughly posted would seem to come from a strong desire to keep poachers away for whatever reason is that a reaction to the experience of having a man killed here two years ago
6753775 yes i understand how you might think that but believe me the police have far more information about all of this than i can supply for you
6753776 if you request that i not bother you again and that i stay off your property i promise to respect that you must find it so peaceful here
6753777 but ill be in loudoun county for two weeks before hunting season even opens and want to be as prepared as possible for when you know the shootings start and as i mentioned you may have something useful to say whether you realize it or not
6753778 does your pursuit of this story seem at all vulture like to you
6753779 and ill tell you why my personal feeling is that this situation is victimless in the usual sense of a victim the so called victims are poachers they are out there trespassing killing animals on the property of people who for whatever their reasons do not want those animals killed poachers dont need the animals for food maybe they deliberately break the law to put a little more personal danger in hunting i mean are hunters never embarrassed for themselves they dress up in their elmer fudd outfits and feel macho but at some level they must dimly realize how cowardly they really are its just a party but they so badly want to strut around and be big men its a sport but not much of one considering the dice are so heavily loaded in their favor this sniper is actually introducing the poachers to some real danger for a change in a weird way and this just came to me so i havent thought it through in a weird way the killer is lending their actions some dignity by leveling the field a bit by lessening their shameful advantage
6753780 of course those are my personal views which will be undetectable in the eventual articles i write about this
6753781 true objectivity does not exist but my work is always objectively presented
6753782 nellie bly had her biases too if i recall my history correctly
6753783 well yeah almost everybody knows your line of business and what youre here for i was the one that mentioned it was that okay
6753784 partly it was because it was good gossip but partly i thought if people knew who you were and what youre here for itd save you a whole lot of time having to make introductions and everything
6753785 thought id come down and show you to my office this is an odd building and theres no receptionist to give directions
6753786 mark i know youve consistently declined mentioning suspects but what about a motive just generally
6753787 so far there is no common thread among the victims weve got old men and young guys married and single intoxicated and sober novice hunters and seasoned hell weve even got republicans and democrats
6753788 seems like this person just goes out and takes the first clean shot he can get
6753789 sort of like how the hunter chooses which deer to shoot
6753790 is it true there exists not one piece of physical evidence beyond the eight bodies themselves
6753791 its hunting season for shit sakes there are guys out there shooting rifles everywhere somebody finds a fresh shell casing on the ground somewhere and big deal there are hundreds of em spread all over the county
6753792 and the rifle shot where it seems to come from i mean wouldnt mean anything either would it
6753793 any anti hunting activist groups in the county or nearby
6753794 oh anything from worrying about the kids getting hit to providing sanctuary for the deer to being fed up with the dogs bringing rotted parts into the yard to being sick of picking up empty beer bottles and cans
6753795 and the crime scenes have been posted for a good mix of those reasons
6753796 the person were after has most factors in their favor but you mentioned motive say theres some pre existing motive something that lets us narrow it down to a few people then we can monitor these individuals especially with the federal manpower that were taking on this year and maybe come up with something
6753797 youve lost me what would an example of a pre existing motive be
6753798 oh i dont know say you have a grudge against one of the victims maybe but you put him in with a random bunch for confusions sake or maybe you want general revenge for something
6753799 thats about it i guess i need to make myself available for the local busybodies to regale me with their theories the revenge particulars might emerge and that could tell me who theyll be watching when the action begins
6753800 you sound tired honey do i still get to call you honey especially when youre out of town and i miss you what does the rest of your day look like
6753801 the rest of my day looks like hanging out in town and listening to a few dozen okay maybe just several amateur sleuths crime solving ideas
6753802 hey ill bet you ten dollars at least one theory involves aliens or ufos
6753803 thats a sucker bet how about we talk percentages magnussen ill pay up if ten percent or more of the people i talk to mention space or space creatures and i swear to be honest
6753804 no not you sorry faye carson the reclusive woman remember parks her truck here at the end of the road i told you about last night anyway its been vandalized i just noticed it
6753805 i dont know its just that i spent the night here and its familiar now away from town and kind of pretty i automatically drove back here from the sheriffs guess it feels like home base
6753806 nice home base they probably did their dirty work while you were there and sleeping last night better find a safer spot or stay at the motel the paper sure is paying for an expensive shower a little leftover semen on the bedspread wont kill you
6753807 making me nauseous now chloe really listen im going up to tell faye carson about this maybe shell regard it as a favor which it is and open up to me a little
6753808 this is going to be a long few weeks will you call me later
6753809 call you on the hike back down okay but bye for now
6753810 i dont have a problem with you still calling me honey
6753811 i dont know now im kind of over it how about goofball may i call you goofball huh honey
6753812 sorry to intrude once more but i happened to notice that someone has liberated the air from two of your tires they freed vodka from several fifth bottles too and left them by your truck i thought you should know in case you wanted to report it or at least to keep it from being an unexpected hindrance next time you try to go somewhere
6753813 i mean how did you come to notice the truck
6753814 thats all just wanted to give you that message and will certainly never bother you again ms carson
6753815 colt think its time we made a friend come on if you dont like her well forget the whole thing
6753816 well at least they simply let the air out and didnt slash them this time
6753817 probably kids having an atypical lifestyle seems quite enough reason to make a target of someone this is nothing to get worked up about
6753818 id say it is something to get worked up over a couple times a year this harassment shouldnt be shrugged off
6753819 yes it should it should be shrugged off i have an air pump at the cabin and will bring it next time down fixing this will take less than five minutes
6753820 but the jerks who do it shouldnt get off so easily
6753821 if raccoons break into your garbage make a huge mess once in a while what do you do probably clean it up and nothing else
6753822 thats why youre worked up and i am not my expectations of the human animals capacity to know better are extremely low comfortably and realistically low so low that this means no more than raccoons raiding garbage cans
6753823 easier to put the garbage back than to hunt down old mama raccoon and warn her to keep her heathens under control which wouldnt help anyway now im wishing id used a more appetizing analogy garbage messes do not make for nice conversation right before eating
6753824 it occurred to me as you departed my cabin a while ago that i hadnt thanked you for helping with the wood yesterday so thank you
6753825 and it was good of you to come all the way up the hill to warn me about the tires
6753826 here you go colt carson and what a solid name you have thats your real name too isnt it not just something made up
6753827 colt certainly is his true name he was here almost two weeks before letting me know it i believe thats when he made the final decision to stay colt carson has a sturdy sound but you may call him colt and please call me faye
6753828 pancakes this morning at the teakway eatery but ill have to get a jar of peanut butter and some bread to have handy i didnt realize how hungry id gotten looks like food might emerge as a practical problem unless i resign my arteries to the diners grease du jour or drive all the way to bristol every day peanut butters a good idea thanks again
6753829 colt and i would like for you to come to dinner at the cabin tomorrow afternoon
6753830 youre just in time to have some say in how much garlic and basil we put in our tomato sauce and you get to pick the pasta all by yourself
6753831 wish i could take the credit but have never developed the knack for canning one of my two friends here is a wonderful woman who has a special touch with many things canning and gardening are among them
6753832 her name is theory james shes truly special has twenty or thirty im not joking grandchildren most of whom seem to live with her and yet she somehow creates time for so much else theorys an avid extremely committed bird watcher and she comes to see me twice a year in the fall to bring home canned vegetables and in the spring to drop off seedlings for my garden
6753833 im sure i will theres a corkscrew in that drawer
6753834 thats the idea each door squarely faces a cardinal direction
6753835 and all that firewood very smart to use it as an insulating layer around the porch like that i see its double thick in some places but not quite all the way around do you have much more wood to haul in
6753836 two or three days should finish it i cut and split some dead trees in the spring and only need to cart the wood in here from where they fell
6753837 may i help you with the rest i really enjoy physical work
6753838 that would be fine but dont let it interfere with your purpose for being here shall we see this sunset through while were waiting for the bread machine to finish
6753839 how beautiful you know id truly love to help with the firewood even chloe isnt such a slave driver as to begrudge the equivalent of a weekend off but it doesnt have to be on saturday or sunday ill come up whenever you plan to get the wood
6753840 very nice this will go well with dinner and sure if you want the exercise i certainly wont refuse your help
6753841 its pretty good i had to chance it pickins are kinda slim down there at the general store but im sure you know that all too well
6753842 youve got goose bumps and an empty glass lets go inside and get these doors shut you need a refill and we probably want a fire in one of the fireplaces
6753843 i noticed there are two fireplaces a north and a south one bet you stay cozy all winter
6753844 it has to be fairly cold and windy out to require lighting that second one
6753845 i didnt name them nine years ago they were a gift from my other friend gainey miller he showed up one fine fall day carrying two of the most beautiful white puffs said despite their dainty looks they were from a long line of good mousers gave their names as castor and pollux and left them here
6753846 i dont believe that was a factor theyve turned out to be wonderful boys
6753847 he jokes that his wife says its for gainy weighty shes apparently preoccupied with his diet
6753848 he has a corny sense of humor but it makes him utterly likeable i see him maybe twice a year too
6753849 and thats it thats all the human interaction you have
6753850 that and the vandals and poachers yes its quite sufficient believe me
6753851 if you want to top off our glasses ill get this on the table everything looks ready
6753852 to tell the truth i havent had time to pick that up yet
6753853 nothing i guess but thats not why this tastes so good it really is good
6753854 number one i consider you a friend now and thus off limits as part of this crazy murder research i will solicit no comments from you about the shootings nothing and i do not intend to seek secondary sources concerning you your life here or your past but there are two things you should be aware of in a couple of discussions this afternoon your name came up as a suspect i immediately steered the subject elsewhere but want you to know that in popular theories around here youre running a close second to space aliens in these peoples minds for the title of poacher poacher i swear im not telling you this so youll address it please dont i just think you should know whats being said
6753855 as i mentioned i get them off the subject right away i wont gossip about a friend and gossip is all it is about like your being picked on by kids who flatten tires a unique lifestyle makes you a target thats all
6753856 yeah the other thing thats trickier my editor chloe magnussen is one of these people whos practically hard wired to the internet the mere sound of an interesting noun let alone the name of a person she doesnt know and chloe has a search engine after it in seconds so last night after i mentioned your invitation to dinner she did a search on your name
6753857 your former software company apparently still posts your bio chloe says youre quite photogenic by the way and shes impressed to distraction that you were ceo of such a successful company im very sorry faye this seems like a boorish invasion of your privacy
6753858 dont give it another thought i told ron he should put all that in the archives and leave only fresh information on the web site but hes sentimental
6753859 why would that be her job exactly as your editor i mean
6753860 its not precisely part of her job but more of a personal issue
6753861 now its my turn to apologize i hope the invitation hasnt caused complications for you
6753862 no not at all dont think that really enough about chloe and being honest and all that
6753863 just a minute what would i find if i were to do a search for chloe magnussen on the net
6753864 lots but how would you like to borrow my laptop sometime
6753865 no need ron makes sure i always have the latest wireless gadget and at least five full batteries im supposed to send him the spent ones for recharging but i seldom use this thing just an email to ron now and then
6753866 unbelievable who would ever think you have internet access up here
6753867 by the way all the bread youve slipped to colt has not gone unnoticed are you trying to buy his affection
6753868 why yes i am he already has mine im just trying to even things up
6753869 you caught me i was a bibliophile before reforming to become a hermit
6753870 ill say how lucky you are to have all these and the time to read them youve seized a nice life for yourself faye
6753871 and i do find it pleasant but should be going now ill bet youre an early riser
6753872 some days it depends but about your going its a long way down to the road and that path can be difficult to navigate in the dark why dont you sleep here
6753873 no thank you absolutely not youve been more than hospitable and i dont intend to wear out my welcome
6753874 anyway the moon is up by now and should be full enough to light the path tonight
6753875 honestly id prefer you didnt drive after having wine on an empty stomach if youre uncomfortable about there being only one bed i have a sleeping bag and will happily camp on the floor to keep you off the roads
6753876 oh yeah that reminds me of a third thing i wanted to tell you
6753877 you dont have to worry about me driving anywhere ive spent the last two nights in my sleeping bag in the rear section of the van parked at the foot of your trail that first night in loudoun county i stayed parked there all night after hiking back down the next afternoon i sort of automatically drove back there thats when i discovered your flats now that spot feels familiar so id just as soon sleep there tonight too if you dont object
6753878 of course its fine with me park there whenever you like but doesnt the newspaper pay for your lodging when youre on an assignment
6753879 well tell me is that nauseating if you dont think so you need to watch one of those expos s they go into a darkened room with a couple of those lights and these blue glowing smears show up everywhere they look like very sick christmas decorations oh yes the idea makes you eager to snuggle down for a good nights sleep
6753880 im sold no motels and feel free to park down there every night but tonight youll get much more sleep by staying here its late and even with all my practice thats a forty minute hike
6753881 thanks really but i shouldnt and i just remembered another obstacle if i dont check in with my mandatory nighttime email to chloe shell have the national guard up here looking for me
6753882 fine then colt and i will walk you to your van
6753883 and have to hike all the way back up theres no way im going to let you to do that i mean it
6753884 will you at least take the rest of this bread and a jar of peanut butter with you i have more
6753885 and thank you for coming i enjoyed this evening if youre serious about hauling firewood how about friday morning
6753886 come on colt that should give her enough of a head start
6753887 at this point wed be officially spying on her if we stayed any longer
6753888 boy when this place clears out it really clears out
6753889 out talking with people delia do you ever go home
6753890 best way to look at it is this is my home
6753891 well its kind of stalled out hard to explain but theres a moment during the research of every piece when the whole thing crystallizes the perfect angle suddenly becomes obvious from that point on im just piloting an unstoppable vessel
6753892 and let me guess you cant quite get that moment to work itself to the surface yet
6753893 can i ask why it is you got here so much earlier than the other reporters judging by last year this placell fill up with outsiders two fridays from now but none of em bother to show up a couple weeks ahead of time
6753894 because the events the murders although they helped me make a good case for interest in this series of articles are not the kernel im after its the whole set of dynamics surrounding them
6753895 well the attitudes people have about them for one thing ive been surprised to find there isnt a lot of sympathy for the victims as a matter of fact people are almost cold about them and victims families are normally more than ready to be interviewed they usually have a hard time not talking about the crime but i havent been able to get a single close family member of any murdered poacher to open up to me thats all pretty interesting since our society likes to canonize even its most loosely defined victims
6753896 sweetie i can tell you right now why that is after the first two the police and tv stations tried to get people all riled up but it never did take because even though lots of hunters poach theres somethin real dishonorable about gettin caught and then to get themselves killed in the act well the kin and all just want to bring on as little attention as possible theyve got embarrassment piled right on top of grief thats confusing for em i think
6753897 so i wonder what in the world possesses anyone to poach under these circumstances
6753898 thats it delia i have to talk to some poachers all these other interviews are fine backdrop but the pivot this whole thing turns on is the poacher mentality what drives them is the most interesting aspect its not even only why they do it its whats going on inside the poachers heads thats hard to imagine delia how can i get access to a few of these guys
6753899 nobodys gonna just come right out and admit they intend to break the law
6753900 delia youre better than a bartender or psychiatrist any day youve nudged me in the perfect direction
6753901 glad to help you sure look perkier than when you got here
6753902 its your great advice girl maybe helped by all the coffee i wonder how much i drank with your constant top offs
6753903 by the way i was wondering about your defeated opponent the ex coroner can you tell me how to get in touch with him or her
6753904 oh i didnt really defeat anybody gainey stepped down and i ran unopposed heres his name and phone number i think gaineys pretty much retired now still gets out a lot though lucky son of a bitch retired in his early fifties its pretty easy to catch him at his wifes store in the afternoons she runs the feed store over in calhoun
6753905 chloe im exhausted help too many people too may words
6753906 why dont you spend the day alone tomorrow writing and gathering it all in
6753907 you know i think i will thank you thank you thats what i need now what about you anything interesting happening up there
6753908 oh baby i thought you were going to tell her
6753909 i was i mean i am dont worry i told her you wont be home for at least 3 weeks they both send their love
6753910 maybe we should talk to them together chloe they need to see to know how close we still are
6753911 no better to leave things as they are for now i guess why burden the day but lets tell them as soon as i get back thatll leave a brief gap before christmas for them to get used to things
6753912 you know im dreading it right they had to work so hard to tolerate every woman i ever brought home before you
6753913 i know but who can blame them whats not to like
6753914 conceited thing youre finished for today right its after five so why dont you call it quits spend a relaxing day writing tomorrow and pick back up on friday i think it would be good for you
6753915 actually saturday will be the day to pick back up on things by then between a productive day at the keyboard tomorrow and some good old exercise on friday i should be quite fresh
6753916 i told faye id help her finish bringing the rest of this winters firewood in from the woods where she cut it
6753917 i envy you wish i had something invigorating planned for the weekend make sure to take some heavy gloves
6753918 all you two need is a wheelbarrow to make this d j vu complete
6753919 i know what you mean they were both respiring twenty minutes ago i do check
6753920 that went amazingly fast at this rate well be finished hours before sundown
6753921 and lose the extra time weve made how about quick sandwiches instead ill bet you dont stop for a big lunch when working by yourself
6753922 sandwiches it will be but will you promise to stay for a hot supper
6753923 do we even have enough strength left to make supper
6753924 five or ten minutes of recovery followed by a cup of tea will make all the difference lets be very still for a few minutes
6753925 if its any consolation so was i colt and i usually take many more breaks
6753926 as long as we were moving around it didnt seem so cold
6753927 and i dont remember sweating but my clothes are damp all the way through are yours
6753928 some not bad why dont i cut up vegetables while you take a hot shower were close to the same size that dresser has clean shirts and jeans in it take your pick
6753929 im not leaving you cold and miserable to make supper while i shower
6753930 just go by the time youre out ill have supper on its way and you can take over while i get cleaned up the longer you resist the longer we both remain cold and hungry
6753931 well when you put it that way where are the clothes again
6753932 one question first im getting used to the cats inertia but do you think colts okay he looks knocked out over there
6753933 thats rather evident anyway they require periods of sleep during the day whenever colt thinks it his duty to stick close for several hours like he did today he konks out hard and long afterward hell be out until morning
6753934 it amazes me that you split all that wood faye
6753935 when you consider it was spread out over the entire summer a day one week two days another its less than amazing consistency is the key how are you feeling
6753936 my legs are stiff ill admit arent you a little sore
6753937 more than a little i would swear my calf muscles are three inches shorter than they were this morning
6753938 no thanks i think thats all ill have for now
6753939 enough willpower is a nice character builder but i cant wait any longer to get my hands on those white puffs of feline beauty may i wake the cats
6753940 all you need do is stretch out on the bed and their heat seeking sensors will bring them to you
6753941 you three four seem to have this covered ill be back soon with a surprise
6753942 its probably the last of this years mint winter has been reluctant to get going but a hard frost cant be too far away
6753943 incredibly good faye i honestly cannot remember having a better day thank you
6753944 no thanks are necessary lets just be appreciative wonderful days are difficult to come by
6753945 are you seriously going all the way back to that van
6753946 but i can promise you i will be perfectly comfortable in my sleeping bag ill probably be asleep before getting it zipped
6753947 its still an imposition and im enjoying coming here too much to overstay my welcome
6753948 that is not at issue are you acting from some sense of propriety
6753949 maybe a little but theres still that email to get out to chloe too you know
6753950 if i had known you intended to hike down i would have urged you to leave earlier before getting so settled in and comfortable i wish you didnt have to make that trip but do understand completely here wear this heavier jacket
6753951 how did you wake up youre in hopeless shape over her arent you
6753952 all the wood is in and believe me there was a lot of it we probably made a total of forty trips loaded down as heavily as we could handle each time my legs are tight today but it was great exercise and the scenery was glorious these woods are packed with wildlife
6753953 are you still going to track down the former coroner today
6753954 try to well see id prefer to casually catch mr miller at his wifes store but if hes not around today i do have a phone number and i want to intercept lindegaard if i can the last time i stopped by there someone downstairs told me he was on the run a lot coordinating with the fbi thisll be the first time theyve been called in and i want to ask him more about it
6753955 you mentioned that last night in your email it seems like theyd have asked for federal help before now doesnt it that email came in awfully late by the way are you wandering around those woods alone at those hours
6753956 it isnt wandering when theres a trail especially one im getting to know well
6753957 but it seems that staying at the cabin when youre there so late anyway would make more sense
6753958 i already know its not a big shock i knew youd have girlfriends cant really believe its taken all this time
6753959 but i want you to understand that this isnt like when id talk to you about girlfriends before you and i were together what i need to say is that faye is important thats all i know for sure right now faye is important
6753960 and thats why you go back to your van isnt it its because youre terrified
6753961 well dont be be ecstatic be daring but not daring enough to mess it up just be you okay
6753962 and i love you now go have fun and in case she turns out to be the one dont squander a minute of the courtship part
6753963 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6753964 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6753965 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6753966 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6753967 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6753968 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6753969 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6753970 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6753971 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birth date
6753972 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6753973 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6753974 if you trust every web site but not a government
6753975 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6753976 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6753977 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6753978 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6753979 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6753980 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6753981 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6753982 obviously he does not want to come out and be arrested
6753983 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out
6753984 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6753985 what were seeing in business in our retail businesses or anything having to do with housing is even a further slowing down in june and july both in terms of credit experience where people first got in trouble with house payments and now credit card payments
6753986 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6753987 we just heard that but no possibility to cross check so i dont know
6753988 since the riots in march reliable witnesses have established that 400 people have been killed in the lhasa area alone if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
6753989 his body brings to mind the beautiful michelangelo statue in florence
6753990 i was on the chubby side and used to swim with my t shirt on
6753991 it is silly shes in no way my muse but she is one of the great american actresses
6753992 im just a big believer in you must love yourself before you can love anybody else and i think for me that breeds the most inspired relationships
6753993 its hard for me to have any proclamation about the right kind of love or how to love because relationships are so complicated and there are so many ways to love on one hand theres obsessive love and committed love and the love that friends just have for one another
6753994 im always so happy to come back to the states
6753995 i was born and raised in new york and so for me coming back home im like ahhh civilization i have such a nice association coming back to a city that i love l a too im always happy to be back in the u s
6753996 the fans were more upset about the break up than i was
6753997 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6753998 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6753999 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6754000 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6754001 ter r rg t ben var m y k lmad m ayaktay m demek istiyor olabilir ama herkes bilmeli ki t rkiyeyi de kimse y kamaz t rk devleti ayakta kalmaya devam edecektir

6754003 barbara had lived at the scheme for nine years and was very popular with the other tenants and the staff
6754004 she enjoyed a busy social life at the scheme and always got involved in events and activities
6754005 she was well respected kind and loved living here barbara will be greatly missed and our thoughts are with her family
6754006 the original investigation into this death resulted in a report being prepared for the coroner
6754007 the recent publicity has generated a number of calls from members of the public as a result of which new information has come to light
6754008 we are now looking at this and as with any information received from members of the community we consider it and take an appropriate course of action
6754009 we are grateful to the people that have contacted us so far and urge anyone who may have relevant information to contact us
6754010 we will be working closely with the coroner on this
6754011 we are appealing for witnesses to the incident to come forward
6754012 there will be a full inquest and at this stage we do not know what happened
6754013 the incident was investigated initially by the police who could not find any witnesses or the scooter rider
6754014 after the ladys death we were contacted by the hospital and as there is to be an inquest we are trying to find out what happened
6754015 this is our reply for the killing of women and children in bajaur near the afghan border by pakistan army bombs

6754019 we have been and are working closely with the obama campaign to make sure we have an exciting and unified convention

6754022 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6754023 this nation was built on a foundation of free speech the first principle of free speech is protected conscience
6754024 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6754025 fails to give assurances that current laws about abortion will not be stretched to cover birth control
6754026 this proposal ensures that doctors and other medical personnel will retain the constitutional right to listen to their own conscience when it comes to performing or participating in an abortion
6754027 these regulations will ensure that pro life medical personnel will not be forced to engage in the unconscionable killing of innocent human life
6754028 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6754029 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6754030 the area is near a very busy part of south east london a large number of bus routes use walworth road and it contains many fast food outlets

6754032 the walking catfish which use their pectoral fins to move and can stay out of water for some time were on the runway and airport crews had to move them before the plane could land
6754033 an alligator also was on the taxiway but it eventually returned to a nearby canal on its own airport spokeswoman lori booker said she said the animals apparently were displaced by flooding
6754034 we thought one of the tortoises was the top of one of the taxiway lights then it started to move
6754035 we had to get the four walking catfish off the runway before delta could land
6754036 we all got soaked but it was important to clear the runway to ensure passenger safety and to get the animals out of harms way
6754037 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6754038 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6754039 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6754040 we do not believe they were really interested in having people turn themselves in

6754059 there were many tense expeditions when we were in close proximity to soviet submarines and ships
6754060 being on a sub it was constantly impressed upon us who the enemy was there would be little posters reminding us to be quiet if you accidentally closed a hatch or door too hard that sound could actually emit out into the water and give your position away
6754061 for about two weeks we were in the north atlantic in a covert area and it was necessary to remain at periscope depth which is 50 feet under water
6754062 it was hard to stay at that depth without breaking the surface and giving away our position it was extremely tense for those two weeks wed spend six hour watches in the control room just leaning over the steering mechanism with our eyes glued to the gauges as the sub bobbed up and down in the water another time we were discovered by the soviets and had to make a quick getaway
6754063 it was as close to the real thing as we could get
6754064 we had the missile launchers ready and we were all manned up we could go to war at a seconds notice not a minutes notice
6754065 while we were doing it we were using our radar to look into russia but of course we didnt tell them that
6754066 i said were not going out on deck we dont know if theyre shooting or what we checked every missile and it was the only time that ive ever seen the ready to load light steady on the monitor we sat there for a long time and eventually the captain came on and said what happened and to stand down
6754067 you lived under an air of suspicion and intrigue at the same time
6754068 being young soldiers you also had an air of cockiness about you and you felt invincible
6754069 but later i found out that this happened on a regular basis
6754070 you lived your normal life and did your job but you always looked over your shoulder wondering if you were being followed and you had to be careful what you said now as someone thats more stable in life i wonder how we lived through that but back then we loved what we were doing every soldier there was ready to do everything he could to preserve freedom
6754071 for the older georgians who remember the soviet domination i think theyre scared to death that its all going to come back
6754072 everything from communism to the social injustice and tyranny that marked that era it upsets me also because ive seen what its like for three years behind the wall and if you havent lived it you dont know what it is
6754073 regardless of who started the conflict between russia and georgia russia is taking their time to leave
6754074 if youve ever seen the dark shadow of old world communism before the wall fell its scary we had a saying when you went into east berlin you set your watch back 20 years they were that oppressed and a lot of them didnt even realize it
6754075 we had the opportunity to see how the other side lived and i actually enjoyed the experience i think it gives you a different outlook on life you dont take everything for granted and sometimes theres a price to be paid for things its a shame that we have to have it but when somebody threatens your lifestyle theres an opportunity to protect it
6754076 no es bueno vivir de dinero cochino ni mucho menos escondida para q no me maten

6754078 lo que sucedi fue el 11 de mayo de este a o a las 7 40 pm exactamente alejandro se encontraba con su padre en una pelea de gallos por que un amigo muy cercano de su padre los hab a invitado para celebrar el d a de la madre con toda su familia el gallo por el cual ellos apostaban hab a ganado de repente se escucho un gran estruendo el due o del gallo que hab a sido derrotado se paro tumbando todo lo que se pon a delante su camino hasta llegar al frente de alejandro y su padre
6754079 que el y su padre eran muy unidos y manten an juntos en todos los lugares
6754080 y as fue que aquel hombre sin pensarlo dos veces tomo el arma que llevaba en su cintura y con ella agredi al padre de alejandro
6754081 while many americans are living paycheck to paycheck to effectively protect ourselves for the future we need to start saving paycheck to paycheck
6754082 our study shows that americans are better at saving money when they are thinking about it month to month on an ongoing basis rather than a long term goal
6754083 we plan on pay raises work bonuses and other monies to come forward but we cannot be thinking this way we need to start saving money every day
6754084 planning too far in advance not only makes consumers over optimistic regarding how much they will save but it also makes them behave in more aggressive and risk seeking ways in other financial arenas
6754085 the easiest thing to do is to be a smarter consumer and make spending and saving decisions thoughtfully on a daily basis that extra cup of coffee every morning carpooling with a co worker and cutting out the extras
6754086 the harder and more prudent thing to do is to mindfully take a portion of your earnings each pay period and save it in the bank
6754087 americans cant solely depend on their retirement plan it will be painful but like that mortgage or car loan payment we need to start thinking about a savings transfer every pay period
6754088 clearly demonstrate that false suggestions about childhood events can profoundly change peoples attitudes and behavior

6754090 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6754091 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6754092 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behavior and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
6754093 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed

6754180 the heavy rain that produced as much as 5 to 6 inches of rain across jefferson county texas on wednesday will return today

6754182 tropical storm fay is not expected to be over the gulf of mexico very long if at all on friday we will continue to monitor fay for any significant deviations to the forecast the most significant change to our forecast for this weekend is seeing a decrease in rain chances and hotter temperatures into the mid and upper 90s
6754183 the most significant issue regarding the slow motion is that fay will likely continue to dump torrential rains along its path and will probably be remembered as a very wet storm
6754184 the turn to the northwest and west northwest keeping fay over land is consistent with most of the computer models

6754191 this negative campaign ad is clearly express advocacy and under a federal law passed in 2003 the bi partisan campaign reform act known colloquially as mccain feingold it cannot legally be paid for with corporate money including those of a non profit
6754192 the ad indisputably concerns an election takes a position on the character and fitness for office of a candidate and raises no legislative issue even this highly skeptical supreme court would turn up its noses at the foul odor emitted by this clear abuse of federal election law

6754219 police officials said the investgation began in response to complaints from citizens about sexual activity involving men at one of huntsvilles most scenic sites during the investigation officers obtained warrants for 22 alleged offenders and arrested two people at the overlook the offenders with charges pending against them were contacted to either come to the huntsville police department to turn themselves in or to face officers coming to their home or business and being arrested officials said those who are arrested will be charged with sexual misconduct and could face fines jail time probation and be required to register as sex offenders after their conviction investigators said all offenders were also trespassed from all city parks for a period of one year and will face being arrested if they violate that trespass warning
6754220 police officials said they will continue to want all locations in huntsville that have been on an ongoing basis for criminal and immoral activities
6754221 what were saying is were getting serious with this problem we had to look at another sense because we knew law enforcement alone was not working and that it didnt matter to them if they got caught or not were hoping in the future this is a better place and hope the design change makes it a better place for the community
6754222 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6754223 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6754224 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6754225 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6754226 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change

6754233 home country family society wealth and all sorts of corollaries are all causes of bondage in the material world where the threefold miseries of life are concomitant factors
6754234 passion and ignorance increase the material propensities of hankering for material enjoyment and a strong sense of lust provokes the accumulation of wealth and power
6754235 in this verse the word mahodayodayat indicates that by the blessings of a great soul one becomes materially opulent but when one gives up attachment to material wealth that should be considered an even greater blessing from the great souls

6754237 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6754238 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6754239 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6754240 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6754241 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change
6754242 why should children or adults be asked to do something computers and related equipment can do much better than they can

6754244 reputation as a person suitable to work with or be associated with children and consequently the market for or value of the work is seriously diminished
6754245 but by the same token we know these very same people are not interested in less religiosity in the political discourse they almost universally want a religious person as president
6754246 its not that they want to take religion out of politics its that their frustrations with the way things seem to be going are leading them to say well maybe churches should back off on this
6754247 theology involves both theory knowledge and practice life for the sake of its pastoral function assisting people to enjoy and glorify god

6754249 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6754250 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6754251 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
6754252 readers should note that anonymous submissions made to multiple rumor sites are generally false
6754253 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong

6754255 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream

6754272 personally i love touring south africa its the ultimate rugby experience its the ultimate rugby nation if you look at things over a long period of time this is the place you come to test yourself
6754273 theyre a pretty complete side you dont get the world cup without being that
6754274 if you look within those games they could very easily have been the other way around thats just the nature of tri nations rugby

6754399 cash flow is a better measure of the discretionary resources available to firms than profits
6754400 but while prices profits and cash flow have risen dramatically investment in exploration has not especially by the largest iocs
6754401 development expenditures reflect investments in fields that have already been discovered and are the easiest most cost effective way to boost output in the short run nonetheless it is investment in the exploration of new fields that will assure the long term viability of these firms
6754402 share buybacks equity repurchases have absorbed a growing share of these outlays rising from only 1 in 1993 to 37 1 in 006 while expenditures on exploration account for a decreasing proportion declining from 13 8 in 1993 to only 5 8 in 006 it is interesting to note that despite an almost 50 increase in exploration expenditures from 006 these expenditures as a share of the total increased from 5 3 to only 5 8
6754403 smaller firms are more aggressive in spending for reserves additions than the big five through growing exploration outlays and through acquisitions from other firms
6754404 the big five are gradually depleting their reserves with an average replacement ratio of only 8
6754405 to some extent the decline for the big five is attributable to the downward restatement of reserves especially by royal dutch shell
6754406 the oil production of the five largest oil companies has declined since the mid 1990s oil production for the five largest oil companies fell from 10 5 million b d in 1996 to 9 45 million b d in 2 005 before rebounding to 9 7 million b d in
6754407 increasingly the iocs have become more like general contractors coordinating the operation of a number of suppliers who themselves are the ones who undertake seismic work analyze data provide drilling rigs and crews and a host of oil field services the larger iocs also serve the function of bankers providing the vast amount of financial resources required to projects in increasingly unfavorable and difficult environments they also provide the management organizational skills and oversight that these large projects require

6754413 i am concerned about the issue and have asked the commissioner to look at it as a priority
6754414 i will be looking for the best way to ensure that sport and recreational clubs have safe operating practices without onerous requirements

6754424 a species of red algae for instance produces under increased ultraviolet radiation less red light harvesting proteins thus decreasing the absorption of radiation the typical red colour of the alga fades and the plant gets white tips
6754425 the algae additionally produce substances which react similar to melanin in human skins mycosporin amino acids maa
6754426 we examine the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation on algae and their protective mechanisms
6754427 our investigations show that the distribution of certain species of brown algae is inhibited by the climate of ultraviolet radiation the algae are displaced into deeper water layers if ultraviolet radiation increases
6754428 we want to observe the development of marine coastal ecosystems in the face of global climate change not only an increased ultraviolet radiation plays a decisive role but also the water temperature which has been increased by the greenhouse effect this increase in temperature can particularly be felt on spitsbergen in the atlantic sector of the arctic
6754429 as we get a better reading of the macroeconomic issues in the second half of the year rationalize our expenses and assess the impact of the actions undertaken in our european operations and retail we will update our guidance accordingly

6754455 against a market background of properties sales being the lowest in 40 years and no sign of any improvement the directors have concluded there is no realistic prospect of recovering the investment that has been put into hipstar over the past three years
6754456 the hipstar losses have already been written off in the groups accounts
6754457 para m es un resultado grande es la competencia m s fuerte que un atleta puede tener hice todo lo que pude pero me lesion en el sgeundo asalto sent que la rodilla se me fue de lado y me fue imposible usar la otra porque no me pod a apoyar trat de terminar el combate y di gracias a dios
6754458 llegu a sentir la medalla la anhel desde que entr al estadio sent las ganas y quer a verme en el podio y ver mi bandera luego de ganar el segundo combate pens que s se pod a
6754459 son mis primeros juegos ol mpicos no cualquiera debuta as hay que prepararnos para los que siguen ojal nos apoyen m s tenemos probabilidades
6754460 las medallas ol mpicas quedan en la historia y argentina no tiene muchas pero este equipo ya le lleva tres seguidas eso es importante as que estamos muy contentas y orgullosas y no queda m s que celebrarlo
6754461 quer amos la del oro pero nos topamos con un rival muy potente holanda en semifinales que es en este momento el mejor del mundo as que hoy peleamos la de bronce porque no es lo mismo volver con medalla que sin medalla
6754462 si nos hubiera tocado con china en semifinales quiz s la historia ser a otra
6754463 creo que fallamos much simo en la primera mitad no pudimos jugar nuestro hockey al estilo alem n y finalmente en la segunda logramon anotar y buscamos fuertemente llegar al 2 2 pero bueno argentina es siempre peligrosa y en eso lleg el tercer gol y la medalla para ellas

6754466 i dont have all the time in the world there has to be some kind of measure for what is effective and what isnt
6754467 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6754468 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6754469 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6754470 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6754471 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change
6754472 it was a very close knit friendship with one ideal to help the jews
6754473 he got really angry but i told him if youre angry we wont make a deal
6754474 he went out there and risked his neck in actual negotiations
6754475 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6754476 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6754477 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6754478 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6754479 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6754480 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6754481 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6754482 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6754483 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6754484 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6754485 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6754486 if you trust every web site but not a government
6754487 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6754488 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6754489 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6754490 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6754491 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6754492 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6754493 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6754494 i feel that a lot of people misinterpreted bolts gestures for innocent or malicious reasons there may be more than one level of culture clash at work race and class being obvious but also the aspirations and motivation of the modern athlete
6754495 i would like to thank the academy for this very prestigious award
6754496 it is believed that the explosion took places as another suicide bomber was sitting inside
6754497 im living with one foot placed in the future and the other
6754498 this is a blatant and unjustifiable attempt to gut a landmark environmental law that has protected our treasured american wildlife for more than three decades once again the bush administration is putting its political interests first leaving scientific decisions in non scientific hands and corroding proud institutions of government to further its own ends

6754506 as can be seen the house and the adjacent lot are landscaped as one property there appears to be a wall around both properties together enclosing the house and its side yard there appears to be no access from the street to the property rezko purchased except through the obamas driveway it is in other words the yard of the obamas house rather than merely purchasing a separate lot rezko appears to have purchased the yard of the obama manse and allowed them to live in the house yard property amounting to a gift or loan if you will of considerable value

6754518 normally you see inflows going down in times of economic downturn because m amp a flows are highly cyclical but this time a weak dollar might have helped
6754519 there probably may be good deals to be made because of stock markets and a weak dollar
6754520 assets are cheap in the u s when priced in foreign currencies especially against emerging currencies
6754521 we now have the emerging market universe that has a bigger share of the global economic pie we have another economic bloc which is growing robustly and companies are cash rich
6754522 going forward the issue for fdi is do investors perceive the u s has the best value of available opportunities if the dollar starts to appreciate noticeably it starts to become an issue
6754523 not only is the u s seen as having a more favorable corporate profits outlook than the euro zone but the quality of those earnings is also seen to be improving in the u s while deteriorating in the euro zone

6754532 ought to be held on retainer by the mcnabb clan for all your defending of mcnabb
6754533 if we can get through the non curtis portion of the schedule
6754534 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6754535 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6754536 perhaps we should at least pretend to care before simply clearing the gymnasts
6754537 wir gehen mit der denkweise nach dortmund dass wir danach vier punkte auf dem konto haben

6754540 wir sind gut drauf so dass es ein interessantes duell wird

6754548 well you win one and you never want to lose again
6754549 nothing is better than winning and im at a loss for words about how well this team played thats three in a row for us and i would love to see it continue on
6754550 you still have to approach it the same way you have to go and train hard and do what you can to improve
6754551 its a matter of working as hard as i can to get stronger
6754552 obviously every guy can get better and i just want to get better as i go on
6754553 weve been quite pleased with what weve seen through the first three practices
6754554 the standard that we established last year has carried on through and were very happy with the returning guys and the condition that theyre in and the leadership roles theyve taken in camp
6754555 its time to get down to the brass tacks now and time for us to find out who wants to play for the moose jaw warriors and who goes home

6754572 the greatest thing in this world is not so much where we stand as in what direction we are moving
6754573 spending behind the united states presidential election and around the beijing olympic games should continue to boost 2008 revenues
6754574 levels of activity in 2008 should match those seen in 2007 and there are significant new business opportunities
6754575 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6754576 in addition the new united states president will have to wrestle with twin fiscal and budget deficits in early 2009 and post the olympics chinese growth may slow due to inflationary particularly food price concerns and the impact that a weakening united states economy has on the rest of the world
6754577 position the group very well to weather any economic slowdown
6754578 despite these shorter term uncertainties the prospects for trading performance improvements at wpp remain good
6754579 thats where youre told one thing the sky is green and your eyes or ears tell you something else the sky sure looks blue

6754598 we believe this compelling combination would create a strong platform for sustainable long term growth to better address the changing healthcare industry and provide meaningful cost effective medicines that improve the quality of life for patients
6754599 the transaction would create a diversified specialty pharmaceutical company with greater commercialization capabilities an expanded portfolio of pain management products and a strengthened pipeline which would include multiple platform technologies
6754600 our 33 00 per share all cash proposal provides alpharma stockholders with a substantial cash premium for their investment in the company we are confident that this combination would deliver significant benefits and superior value to our respective stockholders and employees and create a stronger platform to deliver innovation to patients prescribers and customers importantly it would also further diversify kings business with an additional source of steady cash flow from alpharmas animal health division a leading feed additives business in addition a combination with alpharma would deliver significant synergies
6754601 we believe our all cash proposal is too compelling to ignore in light of the fact that the alpharma board declined this proposal we think it is important for the stockholders of both companies to be aware of this exciting opportunity it remains our strong preference to work cooperatively with alpharma regarding this proposal
6754602 nebraskas largest industry beef has not been invited to speak but we feel it is critical for the public to understand our position on this debate
6754603 certainly the rising cost of energy and increased demand are playing a role in higher food prices
6754604 however feed alone makes up 70 percent of a cattlemans operating costs
6754605 when we were homeless it felt like the longest years of my life because every day you never know where youre going to sleep
6754606 every day is new everything is wherever the cards land that day
6754607 so many families had children with so much potential and they had no future
6754608 i said i have to find a way for these kids to escape
6754609 i dont think theres any greater satisfaction in my life than to see these kids i saw in fifth grade
6754610 to see them step on stage with a diploma in their hand knowing theyre going to a wonderful university
6754611 the people ive met and the things ive done i would have never dreamt of at such a young age
6754612 with more and more information available for genetic markers such as feed efficiency and carcass traits it is important for cattle producers to understand the tools available to them and where that information can take the beef industry in the future
6754613 the merged business will be by far the biggest reinsurance intermediary in the world and will have unrivalled access to a global customer base
6754614 this is fair value for both parties the offer will be recognised as good value to benfield shareholders
6754615 the price is decent its game set and match as far as im concerned
6754616 the fact that senior management have commited their shares would indicate its their opinion that there arent any other potential bidders
6754617 at this stage we dont how institutions will react but we feel its a pretty attractive offer
6754618 terrorisme er en form for krisemaksimering m let er skape frykt og handlingslammelse
6754619 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6754620 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6754621 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6754622 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation
6754623 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6754624 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6754625 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6754626 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6754627 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6754628 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6754629 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6754630 if you trust every web site but not a government
6754631 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6754632 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6754633 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6754634 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6754635 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6754636 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6754637 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition

6754643 the most important question is is this person prepared to be president second most important question from my perspective is can this person help me govern are they gonna be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally and the third criteria from me i think was independence i want somebody who is gonna be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a a yes person when it comes to policies
6754644 in politics there is nothing worse than appearing out of touch
6754645 of course its distantly possible that obamas grandparents may have planted the announcement just in case their grandson needed to prove his u s citizenship in order to run for president someday we suggest that those who choose to go down that path should first equip themselves with a high quality tinfoil hat
6754646 the six page summary tucked into the third volume of the years harvard law review considers the charged if peripheral question of whether fetuses should be able to file lawsuits against their mothers obamas answer like most courts no he wrote approvingly of an illinois supreme court ruling that the unborn cannot sue their mothers for negligence and he suggested that allowing fetuses to sue would violate the mothers rights and could perversely cause her to take more risks with her pregnancy

6754684 the iraq issue has been kind of difficult for mccain to deal with
6754685 if the white house can work out some sort of agreement to demobilize in iraq that could make life a little easier for mccain because he has been forced over the last months to defend his hawkish position on iraq
6754686 it could demonstrate that obama had a credible claim when he suggested a deal could be worked out
6754687 lowers iraq on the list of voters concerns and re emphasizes the success of the surge and mccain was right and obama was wrong on the surge
6754688 any news out of iraq good or bad reminds people of the 4 300 lives weve lost and nearly a trillion dollars we will have spent by the time we get out
6754689 obama will claim vindication and mccain will say he is right about the surge and victory

6754713 if the lord will let you do anythng else do it
6754714 then god said let us make man in our own image after our own likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air so god created man in his own image in the image of god he created him male and female he created them

6754727 over and over a catalog of hand drawn patterns collects groundbreaking work from fifty of todays most talented designers who create patterns by hand and use them in their work in inventive and innovative ways from deanne cheuks patterns that adorn current fashion to those of robin cameron that explore her interest in art to garrett morins patterns that arose from an exercise for a character called eloie the examples in this book push the boundaries of the traditional concept of what a pattern is the selected works are often not an end result but the beginning of something else of something bigger and broader while the computer is sometimes involved in the production of patterns the hand drawn element is always evident in the uniqueness of these works featuring more than 250 vibrant and exciting patterns over and over explores this magic on every single page and will inspire designers everywhere

6754733 this 51st merdeka celebration come be part of an awakened revolution poised to push the evolution of the malaysian spirit to its absolute limits
6754734 i think that any attempt to bridge gaps that maybe its premature to bridge or to reach something that is not the comprehensive agreement that we want to reach can lead to doing it wrong just because of the pressure
6754735 this can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence as we faced after camp david 2000 and the circumstances in a way are similar
6754736 what are you doing in gaza have you been to israel before do you speak russian do you have a driving license how many passports do you have whats your boss called
6754737 instability in the hamas run gaza strip would be in fatahs interests
6754738 the situation has become so grave that partisans of fatah actually fled to israel for protection
6754739 more proof that cooperation with israel can only lead to degradation and loss
6754740 when news of the beach blast was initially broadcast on pa television in ramallah it was accompanied by triumphant music and patriotic anthems as if it were a victory
6754741 weve raised questions throughout the process particularly in relation to the implications to the non proliferation treaty
6754742 it would be no secret that we would like to see more conditionalities around the agreement

6754746 this deal if approved would give india rights and privileges of civil nuclear trade that have been reserved only for members in good standing under the npt it creates a dangerous distinction between good proliferators and bad proliferators and sends out misleading signals to the international community with regard to npt norms
6754747 there is serious concern that the united states has taken this step with the intention to create a precedent and pave the way for israel to continue its clandestine nuclear weapons activities
6754748 its really weeded out the little guy thats building on a limited budget
6754749 hes not going to be able to afford to stay in the sport
6754750 i get calls every day asking about the price if they dont like mine they go down the road and call the next guy
6754751 for a while more people brought in cars but the regulations are tough
6754752 i just like to see the cars crashing the excitement of whos gonna stop and have to sit there and wait whether theyre gonna get squished or not
6754753 its kill or be killed and you destroy him or he destroys you
6754754 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6754755 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6754756 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6754757 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6754758 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6754759 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6754760 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6754761 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6754762 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6754763 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6754764 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6754765 if you trust every web site but not a government
6754766 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6754767 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6754768 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6754769 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6754770 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6754771 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6754772 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6754773 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6754774 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6754775 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6754776 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6754777 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change
6754778 it was a very close knit friendship with one ideal to help the jews
6754779 he got really angry but i told him if youre angry we wont make a deal

6754782 what exactly was he planning to do with 2 865 bicycles

6754785 digital photo frames are no longer a luxury these days and most homes already have one if not more
6754786 we may decide that there are other ways for us to provide care more effectively
6754787 by now i knew i had to do something so i started doing chest compressions on traceys chest while one of the paramedics tried to get the defibrilator to work monitors were showing her pulse was at zero and we were still on the driveway i couldnt give up on her even though i realised it was the beginning of the end
6754788 wmas first became involved in the treatment of mrs bereza on the evening april 11 2004 when her husband called for an ambulance
6754789 the trust wrote to mr bereza on july 22 2008 in regard to his claims about the level of care given to his wife and expressed its sincere regret
6754790 wmas is always learning from its experiences and strives constantly to find ways of improving patient care
6754791 in light of this case further inquiries into the trusts protocols were undertaken to ensure that the training and actions of staff are appropriate at all times
6754792 although tracey had suffered from asthma since childhood it was controlled most of the time
6754793 i wish id ignored this advice and taken tracey to hospital myself
6754794 to think that alcotts description helped me sort out my relationship with my online journal for blogging is not like letter writing emailing and not like a real live conversation but it is like me leaving something to be found if someone passes by and lifts the lid and sometimes i find something left for me

6754809 if we see banks becoming very dependent on central banks then we must push them to tap other sources of funding

6754821 the police in order to prevent the aggravation of the situation and prevent any possible injuries to the pedestrians took the six separatists to the station for investigation
6754822 clearly it does appear from the information we have got there was some kind of confusion between who was protesting and the media who were within regulations endeavoring to cover that protest

6754845 canon china appears to have mistakenly posted the specifications for the upcoming eos 50d on its website the page was swiftly removed but not before the blog neutral day managed to grab a couple of screenshots these shots are of the translated page however and so dont have any canon logos research suggests that these details are valid but as with all internet rumors they might just be made up

6754877 heres one house american cant afford to let john mccain move into
6754878 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6754879 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6754880 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6754881 if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6754882 some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them others are poor if theyre billionaires
6754883 might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities

6754885 simply based on somebodys race religion or exercise of first amendment rights
6754886 this document clarifies the rules by which the f b i conducts its intelligence mission
6754887 this seems to be based on the idea that the government can take a bunch of data and create a profile that can be used to identify future bad guys
6754888 but that has not been demonstrated to be true anywhere else
6754889 the bls report reflects the hard work of senior management safety managers and others at solid waste companies who have been focusing on improving the safety performance of their employees most companies no longer believe accidents and injuries are part of doing business in this industry
6754890 some of the credit for the dramatic reduction should go to nswma and the waste equipment technology association wastec nswma has helped build safety awareness at small haulers through its videos and safety program while wastecs ansi standards are an important component of a good safety program
6754891 although the decline in workplace fatalities is welcome there have been a number of fatalities involving municipal solid waste collectors in 2008 and there has been an increase in struck by accidents

6754898 i was so happy that i was crying i went down on my knees and i kissed the ground i rushed toward my coach and i hugged the taekwondo master from south korea who helped me prepare for the olympics
6754899 there are lots of problems for athletes in afghanistan most of all the lack of sports facilities and the lack of salaries for those who are involved in sports we faced all of these problems and we worked hard to get over those barriers we had hoped to be able to get into the olympic games and now it has happened and we have won our first olympic medal
6754900 i know why you called you want me to tell the judge that im as nutty as a fruitcake
6754901 the judge hit the nail on the head with what the case is really about
6754902 its about the political leadership in the district failing to provide the resources to help its citizens with medicaid and about them failing to comply with this court order
6754903 when the month of ramadan starts the gates of jannah paradise are opened and the gates of hell are closed and the devils are chained

6754905 whoever prayed at night in it the month of ramadan out of sincere faith and hoping for a reward from allah then all his previous sins will be forgiven
6754906 what if i missed one night prayer or more because of sleep
6754907 whoever established prayers on the night of qadr out of sincere faith and hoping for a reward from allah then all his previous sins will be forgiven
6754908 and there are those who allah frees from hellfire in ramadan and this occurs every night
6754909 allah said all the deeds of adams sons people are for them except fasting which is for me and i will give the reward for it
6754910 and when my bondmen ask you concerning me then surely i am near i answer the invocation of the invoker when he invokes me so let them respond to me and let them believe in me so that possibly they would respond right mindedly tmq 2 186 9 these ayahs demonstrate the relation between fasting and answering supplication therefore you should keep on supplicating to allah swt the companions used to do so they said
6754911 whoever does not give up forged speech and evil actions allah is not in need of his leaving his food and drink i
6754912 i have hastened on to you lord that you may be satisfied with me

6754914 and vie swiftly with one another for forgiveness from your lord
6754915 i will worship you my lord like i have never done before
6754916 whoever guides another to a good deed will get a reward similar to the one who performs it

6754939 whilst chatting with a colleague about your project he pointed out that many music events have a cap on the number of photographers its often an arbitrary number and is sometimes dictated by the headline acts management as part of their deal with the venue the pr that control the access will always try to get the most publicity they can and will have a pecking order of photographers and agencies many pr people like preview instead of review pieces once the band has been to your town on tour there is little need for the pictures when you cant control the review these days its all about control information and image

6754945 the impact of global warming is brutal and tragic for polar bears
6754946 the only way to limit the number of bears that will drown and starve is to reduce greenhouse gas pollution immediately
6754947 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation
6754948 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
6754949 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
6754950 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6754951 our impression is that this is one of the increasing risk factors that bears are facing as the sea ice habitat where they need to forage is disappearing and such risks were considered in the recent projections we made regarding future welfare of polar bears
6754952 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals their home is on the surface of the ice
6754953 to find so many animals at sea in a single survey on a single day is extremely significant

6754963 from time to time there is this strange wish to stop and revert to those good old days when all was just as it seemed to be when you knew yourself and took care of the most loved person you own body and soul the strange feeling of accompanied emptiness and the uneasy sensation that every single thing has less and less taste as days pass i enjoy it as a mean girl who is cought up at stealing a few candies unconsciously unaccompanied i just want to feel your unrequited love timeless endlessly till the end of time so what i ll be lurking around every corner for you or some other unawared visctim to come by the pain that sweet moment brings always makes me feel alive again through my sacred solitude just like a vampire who needs to take away somebodies blood to survive let me live in this way not thinking of the past never minding about what tomorrow will bring for us nearly a monster nearly a fairy somehow half a human being whose living all by its own not needing anything but the troubles arised by my addictions

6754974 when terrorism becomes really extensive in an area we generally no longer call it terrorism but rather war or insurgency
6754975 largely the product of sectarian violence rampant criminal activity and home grown insurgency and therefore grossly distort the global terrorism picture
6754976 it makes no sense to count civilian casualties in a war zone as deaths caused by terrorism mr zakaria wrote since the mid 1990s thousands of civilians have been killed in war zones in other countries around the world and those victims werent counted as casualties related to terrorism

6754989 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6755109 a few big banners approached imraan in the last few weeks but he turned them all down one by one and now we have found out why one big shot corporate had approached imraan with a tempting offer just as the signing amount but the young newcomer declined it there and then since no script was offered along with any script offered to imraan first goes to aamir after weighing the various pros and cons of the offered project aamir then has a meeting with imraan in this meeting he puts forth his points and leaves it up to his nephew whether he should accept the film or not now who will dare to challenge to the super judgement of aamir khan who has not taken a single wrong step in last few years when it comes to choices of films

6755196 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
6755197 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
6755198 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
6755199 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
6755200 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
6755201 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
6755202 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
6755203 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
6755204 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
6755205 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
6755206 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
6755207 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
6755208 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
6755209 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
6755210 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
6755211 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
6755212 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
6755213 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
6755214 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
6755215 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
6755216 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
6755217 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
6755218 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
6755219 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
6755220 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
6755221 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
6755222 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
6755223 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
6755224 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
6755225 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
6755226 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
6755227 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
6755228 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
6755229 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness

6755246 the charge of the bjp that the upa and its allies are soft on terror now witnesses a conclusive evidence with the visit of ram naresh yadav congress akbar ahmad dumpy bsp and abu azmi sp to the azamgarh village of mufti abu bashir the simi terrorist responsible for blasts in ahmedabad
6755247 the congress bsp and sp have become cheerleaders of these terrorist organisations groups and individuals who are mercilessly targeting and killing innocents across the nation

6755292 our mother raised three boys with terminal cancer and was told 3 different times by the best doctors in the world that she will die and shes still living bumping our music in her headphones at the hospital shes the strongest person we know and our ultimate dream would be to pay her back for all shes done we witnessed our older brother jeff stuggle with addiction while we were growing up which was hard for us because he was always the man of the house now hes been straight for a while and making more money than most people in america
6755293 things have happened so fast for us that we havent really had time to sit back and reflect or go what just happened
6755294 i cant say that we were prepared for any of this at all im just very grateful that were here
6755295 making this record was a completely different recording process than anything weve ever done before
6755296 its the first time we ever worked with a producer and i think we all had to get used to that but it allowed us to do a ton of stuff that we wouldnt have tried before
6755297 we tried to make these songs feel as alive as possible and approach it like we were writing a set list
6755298 instead of thinking about it like writing a record we just wanted to write the coolest live songs that we could we wrote this record with the intention of playing it live and its really a preview of seeing us onstage
6755299 when i was a little kid listening to springsteen i remember thinking these arent songs these are gigantic rides you went on and i thought if i could even attempt to do that that would be excellent so thats what we tried to do this time around
6755300 im actually telling a few stories about some of my friends this time around because it fits in with this theme of growing up and stepping into adulthood
6755301 some of my friends are having kids some are getting married some are getting divorced
6755302 this was the first time any of us had gone through these things in life and i kept talking to them on the phone and all these things came out i felt like i should tell their stories instead of just my own because after you write so many songs you get bored writing about yourself
6755303 were not that young and weve already had our hands in the real world working terrible jobs
6755304 we didnt go straight from underground music to this fantasy world of being a professional musician we all did the other side and didnt like it
6755305 if this is in front of us and this is actually possible well thats the best thing in the world you know
6755306 and well smile every time we play thats a fact
6755307 for one reason or another our music tends to be accessible to people from a lot of different musical backgrounds
6755308 hopefully it comes from our attitude we dont give a damn where were going to appeal
6755309 weve always gotten a good response from the kids that would go to warped
6755310 playing during the day or even at night in the open air its weird the sound sucks its not the same vibe as playing in a club
6755311 there really is nothing like your bass pumping on a crazy system and the people are all sweaty ill play in a club any day

6755316 security identifiers sids are numeric values that identify a user or group for each access control entry ace there is a sid that identifies the user or group for whom access is allowed denied or audited
6755317 computers that are running the windows operating system use a security id sid to uniquely identify themselves when you use disk duplicating software it is important to take steps to ensure the uniqueness of these security ids
6755318 have you performed a rollout only to discover that your network might suffer from the sid duplication problem in order to know which systems have to be assigned a new sid using a sid updater like our own newsid you have to know what a computers machine sid is up until now theres been no way to tell the machine sid without knowing regedit tricks and exactly where to look in the registry psgetsid makes reading a computers sid easy and works across the network so that you can query sids remotely psgetsid also lets you see the sids of user accounts and translate a sid into the name that represents it

6755328 it was bad enough myself when they rang me at midday
6755329 i thought of all the players why did you ring me and tell me about him
6755330 why didnt you ring and tell me about someone else not him
6755331 i couldnt go into that change room and say to those guys lockyers not playing tonights after he trained with them yesterday fit and healthy
6755332 he usually comes in and says hello but he didnt say anything to me and just got ready and away he went
6755333 he woke up feeling crook last night with an upset stomach and had an injection to help with the nausea and vomiting
6755334 he was pretty flat at the start of the day and querying whether he would be right to play
6755335 it was pretty touch and go right up to the last minute to be honest

6755337 this case has an added element of humiliation with the young victim being left without his trousers and having to put on somebody elses filthy old ones
6755338 you say you have changed and stopped drinking and sorted yourself out i am not convinced about that but i am going to give you time to convince me
6755339 we will meet again in six months in which time you will save 1 000 to pay compensation for the utter humiliation you inflicted on this man

6755342 refusal to indulge in negative advertising show ed his strength under fire
6755343 im expecting to have some more cases reported yes definitely
6755344 outside of the 40 year old pregnant female all the cases have been definitely over 50 mostly 60 and 70
6755345 i think that if someone has concern in those high risk categories or if theyre feeling unwell and they think they have ingested that we would encourage them to see their family physician
6755346 its reasonable to say that well get more cases related to the outbreak
6755347 what were striving to do is actually do a more proactive role within the plant situation
6755348 as opposed to having our inspectors standing line by line theyll have a more oversight role within the plant itself
6755349 weve increased our surveillance and monitoring of any fevers or high temperatures or sore necks those kinds of symptoms
6755350 obviously we are now aware that the symptom of a headache could be not only just a headache or a flu like symptom could not only just be flu but it could be listeria
6755351 a lot of people are unsure about what they may have bought and whether or not its part of the recall
6755352 this case is going to get only the best we have to offer
6755353 das fechten war der grundstein ich hatte gutes tempo eine gute spitze es war ein irres gef hl vor dem lauf war ich mir ber eine medaille sicher ich wusste aber dass die verfolgerinnen sehr gut sind
6755354 ich bin bergl cklich sie hat schon fter gut gefochten aber das war super
6755355 ich bin am vortag angereist und sollte ihr drei dosen babynahrung mit obstkompott und haferflocken mitbringen eine konnte ich durchschmuggeln jeder mensch hat eben einen spleen
6755356 wir haben mehrere pferde ausgetauscht au erdem wurden die besseren pferde f r drei und nicht wie sonst blich f r zwei ritte im parcours ausgelost
6755357 im pretty sure theyre probably thinking about that and dont want that to happen again but its preseason its time to get work this is a time where we really perfect our craft and this is a time to test yourself especially for myself this being my first preseason game
6755358 its a learning experience theyre going to have some tough games but theyre excellent athletes and theyre great competitors and theyre learning every day on the job
6755359 champs in good shape champs had a good week theres been no setback and hes practiced every day so im sure hes looking forward to playing his first game
6755360 were not putting extra pressure on ourselves but we definitely want to get some momentum going into the season
6755361 we realize the last game a lot of times is just polish for one or two series maybe stay healthy get out of the game and let the younger guys play
6755362 they didnt draft him that high to sit on the bench
6755363 when he signed his contract when he came in two days late i grabbed him and i kind of laid it out for him
6755364 i said this is what you can expect from me and this is why
6755365 hes a bright guy and hes a very good player the worst thing that can happen is that the players off balance and he doesnt understand why im dumping on him he understands thats clear thats been said now its up to him hes going to be fine
6755366 i really feel he is the player we thought he was when we drafted him
6755367 honestly i dont think about what my role is going to be
6755368 my focus is just to be as good a player as i can be that includes special teams every day theres a lot to focus on as far as technique blocking running routes
6755369 its the highest level of football the tempo is much faster the speed at which you have to make decisions is much faster
6755370 it helped them win the super bowl so its going to be a good gauge for us
6755371 i try to keep all quarterbacks who are behind me healthy
6755372 obviously you want to keep that guy healthy as well
6755373 any one of those guys could have been right up there for mvp of the super bowl they took over the game
6755374 its really going to depend on how many plays we have offensively and how long their first group is in
6755375 with every preseason game ive played in id like to play the whole game
6755376 its kind of a touchy situation but based on how much ive played or havent played i would think i would play more
6755377 we want to really be crisp out there for the third game knowing that we will not likely be out there for the philly game next week this game is going to be as close to a regular season procedure as possible we really want to go out there and make a statement
6755378 they were really impressive against cleveland and they have some really good athletes in their front seven
6755379 we feel like were a pretty good group up front too
6755380 i think we have potential and weve laid a really good groundwork here in training camp
6755381 youre starting to see signs not of life but things beyond just the xs and os its getting to where youre starting to do some things in some pretty difficult situations and being able to get the blocks
6755382 obviously its a new year a lot of things have changed its a preseason game for us im not thinking about the past theyre the team to beat in this league were just trying to get better this week
6755383 we have enough players with flexibility to cope with problems in most positions
6755384 weve young players coming through so its not a desperate search we just want to find the right player for us
6755385 we havent had too many issues sometimes when you have people playing out of position you have to be on them the whole time and i thought it was going to be a lot worse where id have to be worrying about hunty but its been pretty good
6755386 with murts out liams come into the team and hes looking really good theres a lot of good competition for places which is what you need with such a long season
6755387 ive yet to really test the calf out i dont want to come back too early and tear it because that would just drive me over the edge
6755388 i think the guys who are playing at the moment have been immaculate so far as the clean sheets show
6755389 julian kelly came on on saturday and hes a very very good prospect
6755390 hes a young man with a big future in the game as long as he keeps his attitude the way it is at the moment
6755391 those who make them become like them so do all who trust in them
6755392 what election observers did not see in a rigged election
6755393 the national election committee nec has initiated changes in the voter registration process that could have far reaching consequences the nec is creating unnecessary and untimely work and procedures for people most of whom are unable to do it the necs initiative could practically end up depriving millions of citizens of their voting rights the victims will be mainly non cpp members because all cpp members are identified as such by their village chiefs and will receive in time related information assistance and facilities to do the work imposed by the nec most of those who do not support the ruling cpp will be left in the dark many international observers do not realize that the results of the 2007 and 2007 elections are largely being decided now through a biased registration process
6755394 the national election committees changes to the voter registration process are deciding the outcomes of the 2007 commune and 2008 national elections before they have had a chance to take place many international observers do not realize that the results of the 2007 and 2008 elections are largely being decided now through the registration process
6755395 sam rainsy is blasting the necs month long campaign to compile voter lists as a vicious scheme its a big plot being implemented in order to deprive up to two million potential voters of their rights the nec is independent on paper but in fact they are doing what the cpp asks them to do
6755396 last weekends national elections in cambodia failed to meet international standards because of biases in favor of the countrys ruling party
6755397 all aspects of organizing sundays polls were dominated by the cambodian peoples party which allow accusations of lack of impartiality to be made he said
6755398 despite improvement s in electoral processes cambodias recent election was flawed and did not meet key standards
6755399 the poll was marred by the cpps domination of media coverage the improper deletion of people from registration lists so they could not vote and other irregularities
6755400 while the campaign was generally conducted in a more peaceful and open environment compared to previous elections the 2008 national assembly elections have fallen short of a number of key international standards for democratic elections
6755401 ultimately its up to the cambodian people to accept or reject the results
6755402 yes i am a vietnamese puppet more than 100 000 vietnamese soldiers still occupy cambodia
6755403 with a super majority of two third you can appoint a horse as president
6755404 the kjv is the only bible to use but we wont use the words it uses
6755405 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened
6755406 i definitely admire him for his athletic ability and everything hes achieved
6755407 im just really glad to be in the mix with that
6755408 i can now announce that tom and i are expecting a baby and we are very happy
6755409 as im sure youll understand we needed time to wait for results and tell our families
6755410 que buen detalle que le hayan hechado un vistaso a nuestro blog pero el
6755411 she will definitely run and she is going very well
6755412 the warwick stakes is a good starting point with her main aim the myer classic in melbourne
6755413 hes been to wodonga corowa and echuca for track gallops and sometimes with the trip away your horse tends to do a bit more than what it would on its own patch
6755414 hes done enough to run a really good race he worked pretty strongly on his own between races at echuca last monday with blinkers off
6755415 if anything im one gallop behind where i was coming into this race last year
6755416 hes a bit older now and hes a bit heavier than what he was this time last year he looks a bit chunky and if he rattles home and runs fifth ill be happy
6755417 but with miss andretti out its an open race and i think hell be there at the thick end of it
6755418 she wont run itll probably be a slow seven and that is not a good option for her
6755419 his work was very good on tuesday so good i hoped i was the only one who saw it unfortunately i wasnt
6755420 the work was better than his work leading up to the san domenico and watching him i think hes got the most improvement of all the horses in that race and if thats the case hell be hard to beat again
6755421 he had a bit of condition on him first up but he had a very good blow after the race
6755422 hes very well in himself and is taking all of the improvements you like to see them take from first run to second run
6755423 when you look at what he did over 1100 metres it was pretty impressive considering its not even his distance
6755424 i couldnt be happier with him on where hes at for his next couple of runs
6755425 hes got a big weight on saturday but its about what i expected
6755426 hes only a small horse so mandys claim will help but hes only about eighty per cent right
6755427 he needs some more match practice as i dont want him peaking too soon when his main races dont start until next month
6755428 i was quite satisfied with his run last week even though he never figured
6755429 it was only 1000 metres and distance wise it was more like a barrier trial for him
6755430 at this stage im sticking with my original plan to run him next in the cameron handicap but ill reassess it after saturday
6755431 if he runs here again hell have to miss the cameron and run in a 1400 metre race at randwick the week before the epsom
6755432 hes a good back up horse so running a week before the epsom isnt a concern
6755433 his last run has sharpened him up a lot and he should run a better race over 1350 metres
6755434 hes the type of horse who has to get travelling to be a chance and he never got the chance to do that last start
6755435 its not an overly strong race this time and hell appreciate this distance more
6755436 they might be a bit nippy for her tomorrow but this lot wont be near us when we get over the 1600 metres in the flight stakes
6755437 in the keith mackay she got back and really got home and was only getting motoring on the post
6755438 ill be excited if she finishes in the first five tomorrow because were looking at the bigger picture
6755439 she got into a bit of a bumping duel at the 600 metres but the way she knuckled down and dealt with it was very impressive and holds her in good stead for these big races
6755440 not only in terms of the hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting for the one month of the tournament but the international media coverage will give the south african wine industry exposure it has never had
6755441 most of the world does not even know wine is made in south africa once they realise this during the broadcasts on 2010 and see the magnificent scenery and historical buildings you will have an advantage on other wine countries trust me with the international wine industry being as competitive as it is other countries are envying you for hosting the world cup it is a once in a lifetime experience for marketing your country
6755442 the eyes of the world may currently be looking east at the beijing olympics but once the olympic torch is doused all eyes will be on south africas preparations for the world cup
6755443 over the past month boschendal has hosted international television crews who are producing programmes on south africa as a 2010 world cup tourist destination
6755444 boschendal is therefore already beginning with contingency plans part of which entails a new tasting facility to cope with the increase in wine tasting traffic
6755445 cape town is one of the major tournament venues with the winelands being little more than 50 kilometres from the stadium i can safely say that the local wine tourism industry will witness the kind of interest it has never experienced before
6755446 boschendals status as an international wine tourism destination with a long and colourful history magnificent scenery and quality wines is beyond doubt however our professionalism in terms of service and hospitality as well as our infrastructure will be tested to the limit

6755468 some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained severe depression and loss of esteem can follow

6755473 this decision by the state of maryland to drop the charges shows that our side of the story was the true story

6755477 the obama campaign thinks if they continue to repeat their flimsy story about barack obamas opposition to the common sense born alive infant protection act that their thin explanation will become true the reality is that actual legislative records directly contradict their story
6755478 heres the truth barack obama killed the commonsense born alive infant protection act in the illinois senate and his campaign continues its game of hide and seek thats because his position is heartless there is no baby at any stage even born accidentally that he finds worth protecting where is his heart for the downtrodden when it comes to the most vulnerable human beings it is no wonder he cannot admit to the truth of his leadership as a state senator

6755722 my question is if people arent showing up for work why are they still employed by the federal government
6755723 theres no management consequence for them not showing up for work
6755724 and what that does is undermine the effectiveness of any organization
6755725 to me its a scathing indictment of the bush administration their total incompetence and mismanagement and disdain for government and running government
6755726 apparently they are so asleep at the wheel that theyre letting people go for months without any consequences

6755790 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6755791 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6755792 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6755793 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6755794 the number of us military bases would depend on the size and the needs of the troops
6755795 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6755796 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6755797 its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that

6755799 i dont think what theyre doing is the best practice environmentally
6755800 im not saying they shouldnt build the resort thats the decision of the people of the bahamas but there are always ways to be more benign to the environment
6755801 one shot of money that comes into bahamian economy isnt going to do people any good if they dont have water to drink
6755802 it would have been nice to have a medal but im pretty privileged to already have one there are some insanely capable driven athletes who dont even make the final and as we saw with rower mahe drysdale so many different things that can happen
6755803 this is like a gold for me in a way given what ive had to overcome its just such a relief
6755804 i had some serious doubts and it would have been so easy to give in and not even line up
6755805 but i felt i gave myself the best opportunity my mental focus throughout the race was an accumulation of all my years of training experience and setbacks
6755806 physically i wasnt the best out there but mentally i think ive got something to look back on and feel proud about
6755807 the last four years ive worked really hard to push the boundaries on things and thats had consequences in dips in form and things ive tried to pull it back together and thats been more difficult than i imagined and then the confidence was really low
6755808 to pull out a final like that and get fourth i feel really proud of what i was able to produce
6755809 excuse me for all the cliches and all that sort of crap but its given me a different perspective given the state i was in so many times over the last four years i wanted to quit three times this year i was so close to quitting to get fourth i had to discover a lot
6755810 i was thinking i could sneak a gold mate but i was working really hard on keeping my head in my own boat i wanted to put as much physically into it as i was able to that was relfected with 100m to go when i got the wobbles and had a fair amount of lactate i knew i couldnt give it any more
6755811 hes been through some hard times that boy hes got a big heart and deserves it im really happy for him
6755812 the last four years have been just hammer hammer hammer you get taught the harder you work youll get there but theres a bit more to it than that and ive neglected other areas of my life its taken a toll and i need some time to recover and come back with a more healthy approach to the game

6755816 i can now announce that tom and i are expecting a baby and we are very happy
6755817 i will need to take some time off to be a mum but before you know it well be back
6755818 the athletes from the united states have exceeded our goals already
6755819 overall we look at this as one of the great successes in u s olympic history
6755820 we had anticipated that would be the case coming in considering the resources they had placed in a very targeted manner to win the gold medal count
6755821 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
6755822 its going to be very difficult to dislodge china the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic its much more difficult for the rest of the world to compete but thats the way it should be
6755823 were not displeased at where we are in the gold medal count
6755824 well learn from this well learn from the chinese but with the resources that weve had available weve done remarkably well
6755825 any time you have 600 athletes competing in 31 sports youre going to have disappointments and youll have surprises along the way
6755826 i would say at these games we may have been disappointed based on the outcomes of the results but were not disappointed in any team or any individual athlete
6755827 the conduct of athletes all around has been what they said they were going to do to respect our hosts respect our country and do their best
6755828 nobody else in any walk of life is able to do that
6755829 the olympic movement is testimony that the world can get to know each other i think history will say these games found a a new level though the efforts of the chinese people
6755830 i think the chicago team has done very very well and the olympic family realizes the quality of their effort and the quality of their bid
6755831 its a very weak position for the u s but our two ioc members are very special
6755832 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6755833 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6755834 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6755835 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6755836 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6755837 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6755838 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6755839 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6755840 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6755841 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6755842 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6755843 if you trust every web site but not a government
6755844 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6755845 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6755846 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6755847 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6755848 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6755849 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6755850 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6755851 a derailment of a train with about 50 people on board has occurred and the train fell into a ravine
6755852 instability in the hamas run gaza strip would be in fatahs interests the situation has become so grave that partisans of fatah actually fled to israel for protection
6755853 more proof that cooperation with israel can only lead to degradation and loss
6755854 whose close association with israel was proven by the fact that they ultimately fled there for refuge
6755855 israels inability to remove hamas from gaza either by force of arms or by cutting it off from the rest of the world has prompted it to adopt indirect means of weakening hamas
6755856 now its using its agents inside gaza to incite violence domestically
6755857 in the gaza strip noting the territory had also seen a handful of other smaller blasts throughout july
6755858 there are elements that would like to portray hamas as incapable of maintaining security
6755859 its not the size of the dog in the fight its the size of the fight in the dog
6755860 u s small companies are a contrarian place to be right now
6755861 most people are still stuck on that large company bandwagon but quietly small companies are outperforming

6755875 thankfully pahad himself will no longer be in government when the tournament kicks off it is clear that he is ill able to make it the successful event that we know it will be

6755900 it is inexcusable that so many parents fail to appropriately monitor their children fail to keep dangerous prescription drugs out of the reach of their children and tolerate drug infected schools the parents who smoke marijuana with children should be considered child abusers by identifying the characteristics of problem parents we seek to identify actions that parents can take and avoid in order to become part of the solution and raise healthy drug free children

6755906 swift transportation is a leader in the trucking industry for sustainable green trucking we support the clean air goals of the ports of los angeles and long beach and recognize our responsibility to contribute to the effort we are committed to using lng trucks the cleanest trucks available as part of our strategy to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases we are working out the operational details of our program but we intend to include lng trucks as an integral part of our clean air solution
6755907 we salute the leadership of these two fine trucking companies whose participation as drayage companies will contribute in a major way to the success of the port of los angeles in its landmark efforts to curtail air pollution generated by goods movement activities at the port and in the surrounding communities

6755909 at the end of the second quarter deutsche bank held 25 1 billion worth of commercial loans morgan stanley held 22 1 billion and citigroup had 19 1 billion
6755910 lehman brothers which has the largest exposure to this type of security is shopping about 40 billion worth of commercial real estate assets as well as its entire commercial real estate business
6755911 banks are scrambling to dispose of these loans typically made to hotels office developers and retail strips before problems arrive
6755912 broader real estate indexes are already showing signs of trouble
6755913 loans made for commercial real estate are typically among the safest because a building can be used as collateral and big property developers generate income from the investment raising the likelihood they will repay their loans
6755914 you do get people that then put in for rehousing trying to move from those areas
6755915 people are moving out because there is a mosque being built for example and in some white areas the right wing element of fear is appearing

6755917 for us to turn back now on what we want to go do it will mean we dont trust ourselves
6755918 i think the players will get to grips with what we want to play and i believe at the end it will be a playing style the whole world will fear
6755919 we have the bulk and the speed we have everything we just have to put it together so that they utilise the opportunities that arise by rounding off the moves
6755920 i must make it clear we want to play a total rugby expansive game we want to throw the ball around we want to use all of our players so that they can enjoy the game and so that the spectators can enjoy the game
6755921 if you look at our starter moves and the way we manage to break the line its all coming into place but after that the decision making from there is one thing that the players are not used to

6756070 our goal was to evaluate effects of broad scale changes in vegetation from grasslands to shrublands over the past 150 years on near surface atmosphere over the jornada experimental range in the northern chihuahuan desert using a regional climate model simulations were conducted using 1858 and 1998 vegetation maps and data collected in the field overall the vegetation shift led to small changes in sensible heat sh and an increase in latent heat lh the impacts of shrub encroachment depended on shrubland type conversion from grass to mesquite cools the near surface atmosphere and from grass to creosote bush warms it higher albedo of mesquite relative to grasses reduced available energy which was dissipated mainly as lh due to the deeper root system in mesquite in creosotebush dominated areas a decrease in albedo an increase in roughness length and displacement height contributed to the sh increase and warmer temperatures sensitivity simulations showed that an increase in soil moisture content enhanced shrub lh and a reduction in mesquite cover enhanced the temperature differences the observed shift in vegetation led to complex interactions between land and surface fluxes demonstrating that vegetation itself is a weather and climate variable as it significantly influences temperature and humidity

6756081 people who have been limited on their water supply within the city will soon not have to worry about such issues
6756082 the pipeline attaches the al rasheed water treatment plant to the water tower in mahmudiyah in order to bring potable water to the city
6756083 this is a shared project between coalition forces and the iraqi government
6756084 the local water director came to us and identified demand for water in mahmudiyah as well as excess supply in al rasheed we provided the pipe and the goi is providing the funding for the installation testing and connection of the pipe everything but the pipe itself
6756085 the government of iraq did the technical piece of the project so that it was completed to their standards and their specifications
6756086 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important i think we should speed it up
6756087 unable to verify the reliability of these results due to data control issues
6756088 specifically quality control procedures had not been established by the command to verify the accuracy of the mission times recorded in the database used to determine the percentage of missions completed within the golden hour
6756089 management reassignment practices and comparatively low salaries especially for pilots and technicians
6756090 one key impact of high turnover at numerous positions and levels has been a reduction in institutional knowledge as many current employees have limited experience with the command
6756091 in most cases these employees ultimately return to the command as more well rounded managers after gaining invaluable experience on a more global operational perspective
6756092 operation iraqi children is a wonderful way for the people of the u s to help the children of iraq and by doing so we are helping our soldiers who are working so hard over there
6756093 the kits have been a huge hit with the local children
6756094 the kits have also given the maneuver units and police transition team a positive avenue to interact with local children with our iraqi counterparts
6756095 there are various walls between communities and unfortunately the walls in turkey have been rising in recent years but communicating with one another and coming to know the other is a strong way toward peace when you dont know the others culture tradition and life naturally you are scared of them the more you dont know the more you get anxious and alienated from those people
6756096 this years theme displays jewish identity through music there will be concerts of turkish sephardic music klezmer music religious hymns from synagogues and maftirim hymns which are sung in classical turkish melodies
6756097 their music is quite different sephardic music involves largely spanish and arabesque melodies while ashkenazi music is more like central european music but both are affected by turkish and ottoman classical music
6756098 this year is also the 75th year of this important event and i am happy to join the european day of jewish culture to tell about these german jewish professors and their contributions to turkish universities ilg

6756113 the viva la vida sessions were incredibly fruitful they gelled brilliantly with producer brian eno and recorded much more music than they could fit on one album
6756114 the majority of the follow up is already in the can though they will have to go back into the studio at some point to add a few more songs
6756115 it will be on a record we will put out in 2009 some time next year the album will neatly wrap up things for the end of the decade then i dont know what well do
6756116 we speak about it quite often neither of us started well and we used to say we wanted to leave we can laugh about it now because we have both reached 100 games
6756117 i am really pleased i have worked hard to achieve that and i would like to play many more games for united
6756118 it surprised me in fact i think it has come as a surprise to everyone
6756119 it is not often a player leaves one big club to go to another like arsenal or liverpool it does not tend to happen
6756120 but mikael did not play much last year and i think he just wanted to go somewhere where he would
6756121 he has been here a long time and he still deserves to play at the highest level
6756122 the mistakes can always happen that is the world of football
6756123 its quite possible that he seemed really nervous after the goal more than normal
6756124 it must be very difficult for him to be at his home ground to play against his former club
6756125 things happen he made a mistake but hes big enough to accept that
6756126 before the cup final we have the second leg of this tie and all our efforts are now concentrated on this match and before we finish it we wont be thinking about wembley
6756127 i think we really controlled the play in the first hour but we became quite nervous and could have achieved a better result
6756128 we allowed slavia to react and find a way back and now we have a tough second leg to play
6756129 the match lasts 90 minutes and we have to take it like that
6756130 we have to accept it we could have achieved a better result a more definite win but we cant change it
6756131 in the first half we played brilliantly they didnt get a sniff
6756132 we came out in the second half and i dont know what happened we knew they would come out and make it difficult for us the second half performance was not good enough
6756133 weve won the game thats the most important thing but we wanted to get the job finished

6756156 weve got unprecedented demand for season tickets parking spaces single game tickets etc
6756157 we realize that well never be able to make everyone happy but at least the higher prices allow us to generate more revenue which we can use to invest in our athletic programs
6756158 i am delighted with the way we turned this game around
6756159 in the first half we were not going anywhere we were not passing the ball quickly enough and we were not showing enough pace around the pitch
6756160 brann are a good side they have just won the norwegian championship and beaten a top side like rosenborg to do it so we know we have produced a very good victory here
6756161 but we needed to improve after the break we seemed to be trying to do everything perfectly it was causing us problems and we were losing possession
6756162 but we got better as the game went on and leon osman and victor scored fine goals
6756163 i will not start thinking about the next round until we have completed the job the second leg being next week
6756164 we need to show respect because brann showed themselves to be a very good side and we know they will come to goodison park desperate to get revenge for this
6756165 but we are getting our players back from injury and the african nations cup
6756166 i was also pleased with the performance of ayegbeni yakubu he came back into the side and played really well up front he kept hold of the ball linked the play well and worked really hard for the team
6756167 he is a strong lad and he is being used by the boss to come on as a substitute when defenders are tiring

6756186 mr david also stated that he witnessed jurors disobeying the courts instructions not to view any media coverage of the case or discuss the case during the trial finally mr david expressed his opinion that some of the other jurors were biased prior to trial because of exposure to media coverage of the trial

6756212 we delivered a very respectable second quarter performance despite the impacts of significant macroeconomic softness and a deteriorating consumer environment both of which continue to weigh on the retail sector our relentless focus on inventory management and expense control along with our share repurchase program enabled us to deliver earnings per share that exceeded year ago
6756213 our focus in this difficult environment continues to be on managing the business prudently and investing in strengthening our brands to position the company for success when the economy improves we are highly focused on evolving and modernizing the ann taylor brand maximizing the potential of loft and growing our factory and internet channels in terms of our outlook for the balance of the year we expect conditions to remain challenging to mitigate the anticipated softness in consumer spending which is likely to continue to pressure our top line we have planned our business accordingly concentrating on managing our expenses and inventories thus despite these challenges we are reiterating our previous guidance of diluted earnings per share for the year to be in the range of 1 80 1 90

6756248 you heard me it took you a month to get ayumi to get rika her credit cards and cash i dont believe you
6756249 whats the big deal she did get the cards and some cash
6756250 10 000 pesos you know you can do better than that and we have an idea of what you did with her last night
6756251 now dont try escaping this one with your eh if i remember correctly you made me get miki a shopping spree after your first ehem with her
6756252 thats not such a big deal since ayaka and i are like your representative in everything but to let ayumi her bestfriend to get everything ready thats like asking rika herself to get things done
6756253 i knew youd admit right awa what do you mean nothing happened last night
6756254 i dont believe you i know you yoshiko she smelled like your room
6756255 well we share the room now but really mai nothing happened last night
6756256 what mai wait a second i thought i was hearing things
6756257 well we share the room now but really mai nothing happened last night
6756258 when you called me shi chan last night i knew something was up
6756259 you only call me that when youre thinking of something important
6756260 so when you asked me about suggestions on what to cook for breakfast i was a bit suspicious if thats what you really called me for
6756261 ayumi paused she didnt know how to complete the sentence actually she didnt even know what she wanted to drive at with this conversation
6756262 rika chan did you and yocchan did you two have sex
6756263 how come ayaka and mai said you smelled like her room
6756264 do i im not sure if i really do smell like her room but if thats really the case thats because i do sleep in her room now
6756265 we didnt have sex we just sleep in the same bed thats all
6756266 wait a minute you sleep in the same room and in the same bed and you havent had sex
6756267 i cant believe you were able to resist the legendary yoshizawa hitomi
6756268 i asked her if we could do it and she said no
6756269 i dont believe you youre not the type and shes not the type that just cant be youre kidding around again rika i thought this was a ladies conversation
6756270 although the outcome might be exactly the same when we dont get to voice our concerns we perceive the overall fairness of the experience quite differently
6756271 the team is definitely talking to fernando but thats the question mark

6756273 it closes the book on a very very sad tragedy
6756274 unfortunately those who are still alive will always suffer from his actions
6756275 thats a victim thing you ask yourself am i just crazy did i make all this up somehow it might be easier to accept that youre crazy and made it all up than to admit that it happened and how awful it was

6756280 in a single day nearly 35 000 frequent fliers read about this topic and nearly 600 have added comments thats a lot of buzz for a single topic

6756324 well you seem a little freaked out these days like youre having an affair with a coke dealer youre not right
6756325 it looks like this dell mp3 player is backed by some pretty smart minds though i think it will fail nothing has really put a dent in apples market share and their have been some attempts that havent gone so well a k a the zune
6756326 when the only embodiment of this grand scheme is a story that was planted in the wall street journal and a story in businessweek anything is possible
6756327 the reality of it is dell has some really cool software in zing the middleware so thats promising but running an online music or media store is not like selling printers or notebooks or pcs at the lowest possible price but maybe im wrong maybe it doesnt matter about the experience and songs are just commodities for the people who pay for them
6756328 certainly apple could use some real competition but it would seem to me to be an extremely steep uphill battle that will be very expensive but then again i dont know
6756329 maybe the pc trolls will finally understand being an apple customer in most cases means being a happy customer
6756330 i think the fact that a lot of pc manufactures sell cheap computers affects these results after all i think many users are disappointed in their 400 laptop running vista of course apple sells at a level that brings more satisfaction another possible reason is all the bloatware and anti virus suites forced on pc users from the get go this in itself slows a perfectly good pc down
6756331 the companies that drop in acsi are all windows based it is very likely that vista contributed to it
6756332 not only is apple the beneficiary of this vista dissatisfaction the synergy between ipods iphones and its computer products has helped has well
6756333 nice gesture but not really worth much they should stop billing altogether and give a bonus three months starting from when they actually get working three free months of a crippled poorly functioning service is hardly worth being excited about
6756334 wow that is a great pr move apple really i havent ever had any problems but i gladly take the extra 60 days in addition to the 30 you already gave me and smacklin the service has worked great for the majority of us
6756335 its very rare unless theres some kind of systemic problem like the computer battery thing from a couple of years ago but even then youre still talking about events that are relatively infrequent its like getting struck by lighting
6756336 the reason for my ranking is that blackberry had much success with creating a device for extended e mail to mobile devices and as a result of organizations rolling out e mail as the first real enterprise app businesses wanted to leverage their hardware investment and broaden the blackberry devices extensibility as well as minimize management for multiple devices
6756337 its browser interface is very strong the cost of the solution has grown more favorable but us 400 for the initial device compared to blackberry devices was a huge impediment its new price should be more favorable for greater adoption within the enterprise but i believe apple lost some potential customers due to its initial high costs of procurement the result buyers turned to blackberries
6756338 drastically impeded penetration as sales resources that had iphones for personal use couldnt consolidate tasks to one device
6756339 they still had to use their blackberries so until recently apples iphone faced a major hurdle as resources who wanted to port over their iphone to support business activities had to depend on two devices to handle calls and e mails now though the product supports exchange so its possible iphone will gain some traction but apple isnt known for running enterprise business applications well see how that changes
6756340 the blackberry devices are just a few of many devices that support business mobile apps sprint has a wide range of solutions that can address our customers needs regardless of the device they are carrying most smartphones can support a variety of business mobile apps and most devices are compatible with gps based business applications including several rugged devices that are well suited for tough business environments
6756341 most of the solutions that have been successful outside of e mail are the more blue collar industry solutions like those focused on fleet management and field services
6756342 we started with the fact that most vendors approach was to bring in a mobile front end and build synchronization between the device and enterprise platforms
6756343 the problem with those approaches one is that from a user perspective its rather painful to learn how the mobile crm app works on their device usually a different navigation paradigm was involved and then you had to remember to keep things synchronized from an application management perspective its also quite painful it has to manage another version of the application for each device for many different models with unique features so the cost of administration for it managers isnt trivial its pretty significant
6756344 we realized the limitations of this approach and in 2004 when our partnership with rim began we sat down with them and said hey blackberry is now the de facto platform for mobile enterprise users

6756360 nessuno vi ha addomesticato e voi non avete addomesticato nessuno voi siete come era la mia volpe non era che una volpe uguale a centomila altre ma ne ho fatto il mio amico ed ora e per me unica al mondo

6756548 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6756549 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6756550 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6756551 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6756552 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6756553 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6756554 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6756555 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6756556 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6756557 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6756558 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6756559 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6756560 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6756561 volendo fare una battuta solo una battuta mi auguro almeno che al tuo amico nuovo nn piaccia lo stesso cd che piaceva a me almeno qst di quasi esclusivo mi piacerebbe averlo oltre che il profumo ahahahhaha

6756564 it doesnt appear she was speeding and she didnt have a stop sign
6756565 despite its reputation for sunny hot and muggy weather august actually is the second wettest month of the year in galveston county it turns out that the heavy rains weve seen over the past couple of weeks are not that rare for this time of year
6756566 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6756567 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6756568 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6756569 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6756570 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6756571 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6756572 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6756573 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6756574 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6756575 i look forward to participating in the 9 11 service forum
6756576 after september 11 americans of every age race region and walk of life were ready to step up and answer a new call of service for their country making that call to service will be a central cause of my presidency because we need the active citizenship of the american people to meet the challenges of the 21st century
6756577 i am pleased to be participating in the servicenation summit in new york city the summit will be an important remembrance of those that made the ultimate sacrifice serving their country and others as we focus on how to inspire others to serve causes greater than their own self interest through national and community service
6756578 the presidential candidates forum will serve as a call to action for the next administration
6756579 i hope to have candid conversations with senators mccain and obama about their plans for engaging more americans in national service
6756580 a very large number of the clearance teams will be stopping by the end of this month if we dont get funds before that
6756581 we do not understand their anger because the government is rushing relief and doing everything to save them
6756582 now it is time to begin wouldnt you say hmm hmm yes im sure many of you are eagerly anticipating crawling deeper into the maze and becoming a legend in your own minds
6756583 haru and isolde you were the best and the worst from the last string of battles but failures both
6756584 worst i had to go up against that madman sruc it wasnt even close to a fair fight
6756585 isolde come on you know arguing with her wont get you anything
6756586 besides i had to deal with my own psychopath too
6756587 enough from you haru i dont need you to hear your speeches
6756588 watch your tongue i still have a fairly full quiver and besides those were shot without a lot of force i could have killed you if i wanted isolde but i dont just please submit
6756589 isolde stop pulling those out might only worsen the bleeding
6756590 do not lecture me you know nothing no one can know me
6756591 ball high is on the right track we have work to do no doubt but overall the staff is doing a good job
6756592 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6756593 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6756594 retailers a while ago recognized how tough it was out there and how tough its going to be and went into defence mode
6756595 every lever you can pull to reduce your exposure and protect your profits you must do
6756596 its unacceptable we have been on this trajectory for a number of years
6756597 we dont see any reason for any optimism in the back half of the year

6756603 our intelligence cooperation and many other features we have as modern humans developed from our attempts to out smart the predator
6756604 most theories on man the hunter fail to incorporate this key fossil evidence
6756605 we wanted evidence not just theory we thoroughly examined literature available on the skulls bones footprints and on environmental evidence both of our hominid ancestors and the predators that coexisted with them
6756606 australopithecus afarensis was probably quite strong like a small ape
6756607 it didnt have the sharp shearing blades necessary to retain and cut such foods
6756608 these early humans simply couldnt eat meat if they couldnt eat meat why would they hunt
6756609 in fact some archaeologists and paleontologists dont think we had a modern systematic method of hunting until as recently as 60 000 years ago
6756610 primates that are edge species even today are basically prey species not predators
6756611 one of the main defenses against predators by animals without physical defenses is living in groups
6756612 in fact all diurnal primates those active during the day live in permanent social groups most ecologists agree that predation pressure is one of the major adaptive reasons for this group living in this way there are more eyes and ears to locate the predators and more individuals to mob them if attacked or to confuse them by scattering there are a number of reasons that living in groups is beneficial for animals that otherwise would be very prone to being preyed upon

6756637 im delighted to welcome borja to the club from a footballing point of view he possesses many of the attributes i like in a player
6756638 he has got great technical ability and weight of pass has an excellent work rate and an eye for a goal borja can link up the play from back to front and he will enhance the excellent midfield options we already possess
6756639 i dont think he will have any problems settling into our team or playing in the premier league although he will obviously need some time to adjust to the english game
6756640 bringing in new players is all about raising the quality of the squad and creating competition for places although weve paid a record fee for borja he has still got to earn his place in the team

6756643 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6756644 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6756645 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6756646 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6756647 because of the popularity of the program we are expanding it to include all of the home games this year

6756657 no disrespect to any of our teams but weve been working to help raise the level of all our teams that participate in our major competition not only the olympics but major world championships our cups and the multisport games that softball participates in
6756658 i think weve heard all through our competitions ever since we started theres no doubt the u s has a very strong team
6756659 the fact that there is a new olympic gold medalist is huge for softball
6756660 we have new nations that are making their presence known on the world stage and i think thats really big for softball
6756661 weve got to keep after it were in competition with six other sports
6756662 some people actually came to me and said i didnt understand if i was voting for baseball or softball and one vote if it was more carefully done it wouldve helped softball
6756663 it deserves to be back in the game well do all we can and ill bet you japan will support us
6756664 last week it was bring home the gold and now today its get it back for 2016
6756665 our sport is too great and too good to let eight years put it down
6756666 our goal was to make it to the championship game
6756667 i think we go to know each other a little more

6756670 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6756671 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6756672 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6756673 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6756674 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6756675 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6756676 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6756677 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6756678 yes we refrain from the exercises but it is only a response
6756679 kids are talking about how their trees got blown down and how theres water but nothing traumatic

6756688 its probably too early to be up but i didnt want to let them get ahead with anything
6756689 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6756690 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now the fig has proved that
6756691 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6756692 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6756693 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6756694 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6756695 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6756711 if stainbrooks goal was to make the current board members look bad hes failed miserably he may have thought he could spin the missed deadline as being their fault especially when hes friends with a man who buys ink by the barrel
6756712 as to who is responsible for this sad state of affairs voters have only to look in the direction of lynn olman and pat kriner the republican members of the elections board who have been in vendetta mode ever since mr stainbrook ousted the local party establishment in june
6756713 if they truly had the interests of the gop at heart rather than an intense desire to see their adversary fail mr olman and mr kriner could easily have helped to ensure that the nominating papers for mr scotland were filed in time

6756749 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation
6756750 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6756751 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6756752 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6756753 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6756754 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6756755 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6756756 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6756757 if you trust every web site but not a government
6756758 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6756759 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6756760 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6756761 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6756762 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6756763 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6756764 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition

6756769 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6756770 president obama is going to have plenty on his plate in january
6756771 what were seeing in business in our retail businesses or anything having to do with housing is even a further slowing down in june and july both in terms of credit experience where people first got in trouble with house payments and now credit card payments
6756772 that doesnt mean that the equity cant get wiped out and it almost has in a practical sense as institutions they dont have any net worth
6756773 it was about valuation and whether i thought the deal would go through
6756774 in retrospect i was wrong to decide to partially sell
6756775 well i can now announce that tom and i are expecting a baby and we are very happy thank you for all your kindness good wishes and support even if it was based on speculation i will be taking it easy but am also excited to start writing for an album ill need some time off to be a mum but before you know it well be back

6756779 newspaper by design is a very absorbent product because it has to absorb ink but that also means it is equipped to absorb all sorts of moisture including moisture and the resulting odors found in shoes in vegetable drawers and elsewhere
6756780 coffee filters arent as likely to crumple or dissolve in water as typical paper because they have better wet strength thanks to longer fibers
6756781 additionally the fluted sides and cupcake shape allow substances to flow through the filter freely and prevent grains from flowing over the sides
6756782 olive oil is a good lubricant because its molecules easily slide past one another thereby helping solid objects to overcome friction
6756783 its film also fills up microscopic rough spots in surfaces making them look polished and shiny
6756784 dryer sheets contain positively charged ingredients that are released by heat and movement such as the tumbling motion of the dryer these ingredients bond loosely to any negatively charged fabric surface such as a piece of clothing with static cling neutralizing the charge and acting as a lubricant
6756785 not only does baking soda neutralize odiferous fatty acids but it also attacks grease by turning it into believe it or not soap
6756786 vinegar is a strong preservative because its acetic acid kills the microbes and bacteria that could cause food to spoil
6756787 its also a good deodorizer the acid neutralizes basic compounds such as those found in degrading meat that can be volatile and unpleasant
6756788 one of the toughest product test sites weve ever discovered

6756811 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6756812 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6756813 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

6756820 john terry has been captain of chelsea for quite a while that must have been an advantage
6756821 the difference here is that i operate my captains on seniority
6756822 in the long term rio will be captain of manchester united there is no question about that it is a position we are very comfortable with that
6756823 his leadership qualities have improved tremendously over the last couple of years and his ability is there for all to see
6756824 i dont think anyone was actually nailed on for it
6756825 it was always a flip of the coin between rio or john terry
6756826 at rios age i dont think we need to worry about the effect of what happened
6756827 but it was the managers choice and he has chosen john terry rio just has to get on with it it is as simple as that
6756828 unselfishness is maybe not the biggest crime to have as a footballer

6756852 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6756853 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6756854 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6756855 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6756856 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios

6756893 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6756894 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6756895 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6756896 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6756897 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6756898 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6756909 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6756910 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6756911 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6756912 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6756913 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6756914 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural

6756917 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6756918 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6756919 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6756920 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6756955 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6756956 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6756957 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6756964 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6756965 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6756966 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6756967 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6756968 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6756969 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6756970 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6756971 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6756972 there have been questions that have been raised that flying could cause a membrane to rupture and the waters to break causing a pre term delivery
6756973 as the major single contributor to high levels of crime in the region
6756974 for this reason we have concentrated on dealing with the drug trade
6756975 in other words our plan has been laid and being implemented and we are well on the way to implementation for treating with the drug trade in a manner that can and we are confident will result in a reduction in the levels of crime experiences in tt
6756976 that does not mean to say it has not happened remember we are dealing with not just tt but waters outside tt
6756977 sometimes a drug bust takes place in another country but it is the collaborative work of a number of countries including tt so it would not be accurate to say we have not had significant drug busts
6756978 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6756979 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6756980 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6756981 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6756982 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6756983 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6756984 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6756985 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6756986 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6756987 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6756988 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6756989 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6756990 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6756991 i can confirm that both sides have filed applications for leave to appeal to the privy council and the court is trying to list both for september 22
6756992 may have compromised the rule of law and the administration of justice
6756993 the weather on the night of evangelines birth was as expected the wind was howling the moon was full and the doctor was unavailable

6756996 gary had gone on a river lime and apparently was bitten by mosquitoes there that was saturday and by tuesday he was complaining of feeling feverish but did not seem bothered he just took the usual medication for the flu and left it at that
6756997 the doctor did not do any test but gary phillip suspected that he had dengue when he was not getting better but he remained home until monday when he decided to go for a test at a clinic in arima when it was too late he tested positive for dengue
6756998 he was administered about three bags of drips because he was very weak i thought he should have been hospitalised but i am not a doctor so i left it up to the doctor to make the judgement call
6756999 my brother was a robust fit person he was always exercising and running that day he could not even stand on his own he said he could not feel his legs
6757000 just imagine the doctor told me i had nothing to worry about but he had to leave the clinic in a wheelchair a big strapping vibrant man something was wrong
6757001 when i got there medical associates i asked the doctors to help him they took him to emergency and gave him electric shocks and cpr but nothing helped he was gone
6757002 right now its like i lost my right hand its hard to come to terms with his death the health ministry has to take precautionary measures and make the public more aware of what is happening
6757003 i would like to think ill play at wembley i hope so
6757004 companies raising prices at the same time and by very similar amounts is what prompted the regulator ofgem to launch its probe into the energy industry the impact on every consumer is going to be harsh but british gas e on and scottish amp southern have not raised their online tariffs
6757005 soaring energy bills pose a huge threat to our standard of living gas and electricity are essential commodities which have now become a luxury many can no longer afford
6757006 men det ser ut som om det sitter ett gummiband nedtill p den det ser konstigt ut
6757007 establishment of such a group is a political step the key issue is to evaluate the situation and develop corresponding documents
6757008 i dont think there is a need for a biweekly magazine anymore with the web
6757009 we will have more room for bigger stories and were going to get better writers
6757010 member states with existing same sex partnership legislation to recognise the arrangements of other member states that have also made provisions for same sex partnerships
6757011 calls upon the commission to draw up guidelines for such mutual recognition by member states with existing same sex partnership legislation
6757012 the declaration will be launched in the next few weeks
6757013 and we are hoping for organisations to join the campaign and put pressure on meps to sign up we are optimistic because lots of declarations do move on in policy terms

6757021 when terrorism becomes really extensive in an area we generally no longer call it terrorism but rather war or insurgency
6757022 largely the product of sectarian violence rampant criminal activity and home grown insurgency and therefore grossly distort the global terrorism picture
6757023 it makes no sense to count civilian casualties in a war zone as deaths caused by terrorism mr zakaria wrote since the mid 1990s thousands of civilians have been killed in war zones in other countries around the world and those victims werent counted as casualties related to terrorism
6757024 obviously the war didnt fuel extremist views in muslim countries
6757025 begins to creep into the fiber of a community only to turn the community into an anti social place where the politics become more important than the open conversations

6757028 i think twitter is more prone easier less commited than blogs to express tacit know how and to offer help which also shares tacit know how actually conversation is where its at and an internal twitter marketed the right way will be the optimal example of what we want out of km 2 0 conversation exchange

6757040 on friday august 22 at 6 00 a m local time all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia
6757041 over the course of august 22 the retreat will be completed
6757042 they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions
6757043 we will never live with any buffer zones well never allow anything like this
6757044 by monday most of the equipment will be in place especially the armored vehicles we will have our staff here we will have our operational center set up and we can start sending out monitors into various parts in georgia and neighboring south ossetia
6757045 there are russian interior ministry special forces bringing old people from villages basically emptying the villages on the south ossetian side and dumping them in gori

6757059 it was certainly a rougher time where your emphasis was more on reprisal retribution punishment
6757060 we were a rudderless ship there for years and years without oversight
6757061 we finally decided to take back control of our prisons
6757062 i think the forecast of continuing violence itself played a role in moving people to take seriously the problem of violence in prison
6757063 it correlates almost directly with when we started segregating all the gang members
6757064 they may not have been the ones perpetrating the violence but they were involved in calling the shots
6757065 weve been more successful nationally dealing with the anger that many people come to prison with
6757066 we expected that every lever would affect all of the drives
6757067 the results were startling you can try to create rewards that encourage innovation and foster collaboration but rewards that try to do all of those things get to complicated incentives are not the best choice to engage those other drives you could use a screwdriver to open everything but it would be best to use it to open a screw
6757068 its not hierarchical you have to do all of them at once thats an important difference from other models
6757069 a poor showing on one drive diminishes the impact of high scores on the other three they cannot be ordered hierarchically or substituted one for another
6757070 you cant just pay employees a lot and hope theyll feel enthusiastic about their work in an organization where bonding is not fostered nor is it enough to help people bond as a tight knit team when they are underpaid

6757077 theres no doubt that a lot of our energy is getting spent on possible new signings and i dont think thats helpful for the team
6757078 we have come quite close to adding to the squad a few times but for different reasons it hasnt worked
6757079 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6757080 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6757081 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6757082 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6757097 europa ist ein kontinent der zuversicht dass dies so bleibt daran m ssen wir auf allen ebenen t glich arbeiten auch heute ist wie die ereignisse der letzten tage in georgien zeigen die wahrung und aufrechterhaltung von frieden und sicherheit keine selbstverst ndlichkeit wir d rften daher nicht nachlassen uns immer wieder in erinnerung zu rufen wie wichtig auch der friedenspolitische aspekt der europ ischen integration ist
6757098 f r medien und meinungsfreiheit bis zur freiheit der politischen bet tigung f r den wunsch nach gerechtigkeit und eine offene gesellschaft sind die menschen 1968 auf die strasse gegangen und haben gek mpft viele sind in diesem kampf um ihre berzeugungen und visionen ums leben gekommen 1968 hat zu einem enormen wandel in der politik wie auch in der gesellschaft gef hrt die europ ische integration hat schlussendlich diese freiheiten und vorteile verfestigt und m glichkeiten zur weiterentwicklung geebnet europa ist daher erbe aber auch auftrag und hoffnung zugleich
6757099 wir m ssen aus unserer geschichte lernen wir sollten jedoch vorsichtig sein ereignisse in der geschichte mit entwicklungen von heute zu vergleichen
6757100 die sowjetunion von 1968 kann nicht mit dem russland von 2008 verglichen werden russland hat sich enorm gewandelt es w re abwegig wollte man die vielen positiven ver nderungen leugnen wir alle so auch russland m ssen uns jedoch an gewisse regeln halten grundlegende prinzipien des v lkerrechts wie das gewaltverbot die respektierung der territorialen integrit t und souver nit t aber auch die achtung rechtsstaatlicher prinzipien sind ohne ausnahmen einzuhalten
6757101 russland ist aus geographischen wirtschaftlichen und kulturellen gr nden ein strategischer partner der eu angesichts der starken gegenseitigen wirtschaftlichen verflechtungen aber auch des zunehmenden politischen gewichts der eu besteht kein grund im verh ltnis zu russland verhalten zu handeln geschweige denn sich zu f rchten entscheidend ist stets der ehrliche umgang miteinander er erfordert gelegentlich auch klare worte in umstrittenen punkten
6757102 wir leben heute in einer art spannungsverh ltnis zwischen zielsetzungen und m glichkeiten auch europa definiert sich in diesem spannungsverh ltnis t glich selbst die eu mitgliedsstaaten haben aus ihrer geschichte heraus unterschiedliche erfahrungen im umgang mit russland sie ist jedoch nur dann glaubw rdig wenn sie mit einer stimme spricht

6757115 the thing about a campaign is when you start getting over two players its cool to have that but the narrative quality decreases exponentially with more players once you get a third or a fourth player in there then youre in the middle of fighting a bad guy and somebodys triggering a cutscene and people are flapping their gums and nobody knows whats going on with the story whereas if you keep it two players keep it focused grab a buddy and go through the blockbuster experience and then grab five players and fight against the locust thats how were doing it

6757178 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
6757179 the document is a challenge to various sharia councils who dont believe in gender equality but the world has changed and islamic law has to be renegotiated
6757180 continues the unfortunate trend of separating muslims from the general community in britain and it is deceptive since it leads muslims to think that they are married when in fact they are not
6757181 the existence of such a model contract endorsed as this is by lawyers and mps gives the seal of approval for the continuation of marriage ceremonies which have no legitimacy under british law this contract is not a marriage it is instead a sparsely worded cohabitation agreement of dubious legal status a couple married under this contract will find that they have no automatic inheritance rights nor the right to give consent to medical treatment and it could mean paying unnecessary inheritance tax following a death
6757182 there is absolutely no need for this to happen catholics jews sikhs hindus quakers etc all carry out their marriage ceremonies in accordance with british law either by insisting that the couple have a civil ceremony before the religious ceremony or by registering their premises for marriages and including the legal requirements in the religious ceremony muslim organisations are the only religious group encouraging their members to ignore the british law of marriage and that is harmful to british muslims because it deprives them of their legal rights under british law
6757183 in furtherance of its policy to work with others for the unity of muslims and for the common good the mcb had collaborated on a worthwhile initiative on enabling parties to a muslim marriage to understand and respect their rights and obligations and to enable courts to enforce the rights of parties in accordance with what is agreed at the time of the nikah that initiative has regrettably led to misinterpretation of shariah by those who the mcb had trusted to take the lead on this matter those representing the muslim institute were reported as saying that the documentation produced was a re invention of shariah or that it was a modern or reformist view of the shariah these types of glib generalisations on sharia councils are unhelpful and not in keeping with mcbs evidence based approach to community issues moreover the mcb looks to the traditional islamic institutions of ijma the consensus of scholars as the way forward in resolving the issues of our times
6757184 this mcb policy is as retrogressive and insular as its previous decision to boycott attending holocaust memorial day
6757185 and in typical mcb male arrogance they dismiss the contract and promise to issue their own after due consultation with their affiliates and ulema religious scholars
6757186 the mcb leadership should be ashamed of itself ashamed for not having the balls to stand up for muslim women and ashamed for bowing to extremist literalist pressure
6757187 overall the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly but among republicans it is up 11 points and among white evangelical republicans it is up 19 points

6757209 youre a good kid and you make us proud so just give your best and the rest will come and well see you soon
6757210 the bands music has enjoyed phenomenal success since the cd went up on the net and weve shifted a load of cds and individual tracks
6757211 while all that was going on the bands london office has done all the legwork to get the album to a bigger audience and from june 11 we went live on itunes stores around the world itunes u s itunes australia n z itunes japan itunes canada itunes uk european union and then on other important net retail outlets including rhapsody napster emusic groupietunes amazon mp3 lala and shockhound that means the band and its music is now represented on nearly 30 sites worldwide now
6757212 sales should go up a gear now we hope as most of what we earn goes to the bands own special charity
6757213 billy the mountain were born in the blues and then took a breath of steely dan little feat dylan and pink floyd and came out the other end smiling youll hear that journey in their music which is delivered by some very fine musicians too they say its great sunday morning music
6757214 and this band will sell we reckon they are the pink floyd of this new century and throw in a touch of little feat and steely dan and you have a very powerful combination of grooves and rock steady tunes supporting cool lyrics and awesome musicianship no shredders and no predictable cock rock neither
6757215 to great response we ran some of the tunes naked on the bands own www myspace com thebillymountain site and then the band principally nicolai kehlet took over production and the result is an album of eight or nine very special songs and i have to say the big labels are looking to get their hands on this cool new music but the band wants this to go to market via the internet and we support that idea given that we have little alternative
6757216 but the songs are awesome and i predict this album this breath of musical fresh air is going to be a classic
6757217 we had a lot fun producing the album at my own paradise studio here in bangkok and we work well together with zanders great lyrics and tunes and dare i say my ear for a good beat and an fm radio friendly vibe
6757218 our fans tease us that we are the floyd or steely dan of the 21st century and thats crazy and scary we are all floyd and steely dan fans of course but they are like gods to us the idea that we are composers on the same planet is almost ridiculous but we like the compliment that we might sound a bit like little feat and our new stuff is definitely going there if anywhere at all
6757219 driven by a desire to not let lowell george be forgotten and everything we are writing right now is kind of a tribute to him and his gift as a groovemeister singer and slide god
6757220 theres a bit of hendrix in there too and if we are exposing our origins and ages then so be it its about time i grew up listening and playing while those guys zappa captain beefheart and alex harvey and jimi and zepp were changing the world and were going back consciously or otherwise to a time when music was new and adventurous and worth queuing to see live i just hope we can do the times justice
6757221 billy the mountain has won band for the day and from everyone on the bftd team we offer our best wishes to everyone involved in their success we hope now they will not only be seen and heard by thousands of people but that they will sell a large number of their bftd tracks on the day as our featured artist
6757222 its a great honour to be acknowledged by such an important music site and we will make the most of our day in the sun telling everyone that we are todays band for the day
6757223 and the icing on the cake is our kids charity makes more income from sales on this band for the day feature
6757224 an er visit for something thats not an emergency costs the medical center 1 200
6757225 thats sucking up dollars in health care that we dont all have to just blow through carelessly
6757226 they are arguably if not defrauding then at least taking advantage of a public subsidy we would like to see them give more than the minimum the need is there
6757227 enough latent suspicion toward the hospital and university as elitist exists to ensure that a political attack against the urban health initiative as deceptive and self serving would find fertile ground
6757228 more than a few staff members particularly medical staff express strongly worded concern or disappointment with ucmc in its commitment to the community
6757229 this new health initiative is not really about helping the residents of the south side of chicago it is simply a way for the university of chicago medical center to save money and reduce costs by serving fewer poor people without health insurance
6757230 its hard to know whether this is motivated by the interests of the patients or by the financial interests of the medical center
6757231 they have decided they need to have as many paying patients as possible

6757262 in light of the conclusions in the report and the history of advocacy in this province its not clear that that should be one of the priorities
6757263 crime victims are often the forgotten individuals of the criminal justice system and are sometimes treated with less attention respect and sensitivity than they deserve
6757264 the rights of the victims of crime have never been a priority for premier dalton mcguintys government
6757265 the only time when they took any action to do anything for them was when they were dragged kicking and screaming into doing it by the ombudsmans report
6757266 the office of a victim advocate as an officer of the legislative assembly would address all of the concerns that victims have had and permit the legislature to receive non partisan guidance on a regular basis of where the gaps are in the system
6757267 we are as mr mcmurtry says a leader and a model for other jurisdictions
6757268 we have had in this province a history of very strong advocacy on behalf of victims in all parties at all levels and in all circumstances
6757269 i am really pleased with the performance and the goals we scored
6757270 overall to score six in european competition is terrific we didnt take any chances with the team we put out a strong side because we have been knocked out of too many cup competitions in the past we made sure we were strong from the start
6757271 its fiorentina next and that will be a really good tie i saw them last week when they won the first leg in oslo against rosenborg and they are an excellent outfit
6757272 it is a game we will all look forward to but we know it will be tough because they are doing very well in the italian league at the moment
6757273 you only have to see how good the italian sides have played over the years we have witnessed it in this city they will be tough to break down we saw inter milan doing that this week
6757274 they have got some good players up front adrian mutu is scoring a lot of goals for them so we know how tough it will be
6757275 yakubu did so well that is not a bad first game back at goodison park after his spell with the african nations cup
6757276 thats what he does scores goals we have always known he has got that in him his second when he sent two defenders the wrong way was terrific
6757277 his first was crucial they came at us for half an hour and got at us which you would expect with them 2 0 down from the first leg so we needed to get the first that was vital and yak produced a great effort
6757278 i knew yak had a good record of goals with both his previous two clubs in the premier league
6757279 i felt if he could add that same amount of goals to what we already had here it would improve us

6757287 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group
6757288 sexuality was also improved overall quality of life measures improved even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a small but measurable improvement in quality of life and a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains

6757317 voters care a lot more about candidates personal ethics than about how many houses or residences or doghouses that john and cindy mccain own the reality is that barack obama purchased his million dollar mansion in a shady deal involving a convicted felon and it raises questions about his ethics and judgment
6757318 swept to power in the peaceful 2003 rose revolution promising market reforms a commitment to democracy and re orienting his country towards the european mainstream
6757319 as we saw repeatedly in the twentieth century and as republican presidential candidate john mccain recently reminded us great conflicts often begin with small events just as they did in the two world wars of the past century
6757320 during the soviet era the west did not seriously confront the soviet union when it violated the olympic spirit hungary was invaded on the eve of the 1956 melbourne olympics the mexico city games in october 1968 were somewhat overshadowed by soviet tanks rolling into prague that august afghanistan was overrun even as moscow was preparing to host its own olympics in 1980 the soviet union was settling scores inside its sphere of influence and for the west that was that
6757321 europe is heavily dependent on russian energy supplies getting as much as 40 of its natural gas and 25 of its oil from russian fields the continents reliance on russian energy has served to significantly dampen criticism of russian actions around the world
6757322 ive seen the russians rolling into georgia i wish they had continued rolling right into tblisi once there i would have wanted to see them round up saakashvili and a few thousand of his supporters and caused them dissappear from the face of the earth forever thats the only way to deal with rabble rousing troublemakers who try to play you against powerful enemies id like to see the russians roll into the ukraine and maybe drop a few nukes just for good measure
6757323 saakashvili and yuschenko won elections orchestrated and funded abroad that makes them illegitimate even if they did it wouldnt matter that much to me im not a democratist
6757324 they held hearings and the ambassador confirmed that she had told the iraqis that the united states was not going to inviolve itself in its dispute with kuwait she also confirmed that this was the standing policy the point is someone set america on iraq in 1991 and again in 2003 all i want is to see those who did it punished so severely that the world not forget for at least 1000 years
6757325 in 1980 the iranians were in revolutionary mode they were making noises about exporting the revolutiion the pre emptive measures hussein took were essential for the survival of his country i only mentuion us support in passuing it wouldnt really matter to me if the us supported it or not
6757326 the use of chemical weapons in the south and against the kurds in the north was extremely limited and asysematic furthermore because the iraqis did not specifuically label their chemical shells much of the chemical attacks could have been accidental the very idea that hussein somehow ordered it or even knew of it in advance is idotic
6757327 huissein was in fact the ideal leader for iraq i think that five years of occupation have shown that he was able to keep the country from flying apart along ethnic lines and maintained the structures associated with a modern government his only problem was that he got on the wromng side of the regional bully israel thats when everything else including regional stability stopped mattering
6757328 iraq has been buried under a mounytain of lies propping up other lies not only would i defend hussein on virtually excvery issue but i would dare to call him the most consequential man of the second half of the 20th century
6757329 americas promise to defend poland against attack and in giving poland defensive weapons could create a diplomatic dilemma for the united states

6757360 when a judge makes rulings of law theyre relying on well founded principles when a judge is making a credibility determination it requires clearness of intellect good thought and sound judgment its not something thats spelled out in memorandums
6757361 i couldnt let that happen every one of gods creatures has a purpose
6757362 when mick was right he cared deeply for his brothers and sisters and demonstrated great compassion
6757363 he loved his guitar and wrote many songs he enjoyed animals because he knew they wouldnt judge him
6757364 when micks mind went berserk he was physically dangerous to me and others around him
6757365 mental illness is horrible when mixed with drugs and alcohol it becomes unbelievable i want people to know
6757366 he was clean as a baby when it came to putting stuff in his system they took him off his meds and that led to some anxieties but he was looking forward to coming home in a few weeks
6757367 i love you mom for all the times ive been bad you have stood up for me and defended me more than anyone i know im pretty depressed these days i know ill put all the enzymes behind me eventually i see daily the extent that mental illness can reach as well as all the addictions folks can fall prey to
6757368 he had parkinsons and alzheimers and his weight went down from 230 pounds to about 80
6757369 at the end his knees were so drawn up into his chest that his whole body could almost fit in this space the only way to feed him was through a syringe william literally starved to death
6757370 he couldnt understand why william couldnt care for himself mick would lose it and have spells when he didnt realize what he was doing i bought mick a camper to live in out back because i was afraid to have him in the house
6757371 we knew he would return to the drugs and alcohol it was very hard but we had to say no
6757372 he was in jail in texas oklahoma florida you name it just drifting hitchhiking getting in trouble one time the phone rang and he was in hawaii when we got him to st louis he looked like a bum
6757373 i asked god to do whats best for mick and id accept it as his will i believe god took mick home because he was ready to go i have peace now i know where mick is
6757374 im the one people call when they have a loved one who isnt going to get well im with them when they pass away im not afraid of death
6757375 look at the attention to detail it shows what my son was capable of when he wasnt messed up the illness just kept taking its toll
6757376 we are working closely with the department of mental health and senior services and the department of mental health to decide upon the best course of action regarding the inpatient psychiatric unit as of today no final decision has been made regarding its transfer to the boulevard campus or its relocation to another site regardless of the outcome we will do whatever is necessary to ensure that these patients are safe and that they continue to receive the same high quality care that st marys hospital has always provided
6757377 these programs are slated to continue and should for the most part run independently from the inpatient unit
6757378 appropriately notified as soon as a final decision is reached
6757379 that would be a major major loss for us because we have a lot of interaction with them
6757380 its a tremendous resource for us and for the city of clifton theyve been very helpful in accomplishing our mission over the years
6757381 if theyre approved to be closed by the state that would have an impact on the continuum of care but thats only assuming theyre not placed somewhere else in the community if not in st marys they need to be maintained somewhere else in the community
6757382 what we look for whenever we get any of these applications is access to care that is our number one priority
6757383 its extremely bittersweet im thrilled that it passed and i hope and believe that my daughter had something to do with it
6757384 it makes her passing stand for something and that gives us some solace
6757385 massachusetts has been a leader in expanding health insurance for all of its citizens and now we are focused on meeting the needs of every child
6757386 there are too many children in the commonwealth who go undiagnosed or untreated for mental illness
6757387 this new law will help seal the cracks in our system
6757388 we hold that mcmurtreys memory problems his erratic behavior and the variety and quantity of medications that he was prescribed combined with the absence of an expert evaluation made at the time of trial created a reasonable doubt as to mcmurtreys mental competence to stand trial
6757389 is that mr mcmurtrey did not ever receive a hearing at the time of his trial to determine whether he was competent to stand trial and because of the failure to conduct a hearing at that time about his competence and because of a number of factors that seriously indicate that he was in fact incompetent his right to a fair trial was violated
6757390 this is in the hands of the attorney generals office
6757391 if it has to come back to us we will review the case and determine our options
6757392 he has adjusted really really well and has been living a productive crime free and substance abuse free life
6757393 hes gone to school gotten a job and hes just done extraordinarily well
6757394 im very happy to join such a big club as olympiacos who made a considerable effort to sign me i want to thank the club for their patience and ill do my best to repay them and the fans
6757395 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands squad for the natwest series after careful consideration
6757396 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6757397 i decided to retire from englands odi team for a number reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family

6757540 pienso que hay sustitutos a la altura de robinho para poder ocupar tanto la banda izquierda como derecha tenemos jugadores a la altura para hacerlo y schuster sabe muy bien eso y espero que ponga un equipo competitivo el domingo para que salgamos vencedor
6757541 es una opini n de robinho que ha demostrado su inter s de poder salir de madrid pero es una parte que la direcci n tiene que tomar juntamente con el jugador para encontrar la mejor soluci n para ambos para m la mejor soluci n es que el madrid est bien
6757542 antes de irme a la selecci n robinho estaba bien hoy he llegado y trabajado con l y he visto que tambi n lo estaba pero es una situaci n particular de robinho y el club ambos tiene que decidir lo mejor para el madrid
6757543 siempre ha trabajado de la misma manera y no s si ha hablado durante el tiempo que estaba en la selecci n pero hoy no sab a nada y es una decisi n de robinho
6757544 robinho tiene contrato con el madrid pero pienso que har a mal si l se quedara en el club y quedara mal porque ser a muy malo para su carrera que adem s tiene una fase clasificatoria con su selecci n y pienso que en ese punto ser a muy mal para robinho
6757545 ya he dicho muchas veces que he hablado con cristiano y ha dicho que quer a venir para madrid pero es una cuesti n que ahora no podemos seguir hablando sobre l porque estamos comenzando nuestra poca y queremos hacerlo bien
6757546 lo que hace falta son los jugadores que aqu est n y tenemos que hacerlo bien para poder ayudar a ganar la liga y muchas otras cosas m s
6757547 tenemos que trabajar dentro del campo y honrar al m ximo esta camiseta porque tiene un significado muy grande y nosotros tenemos que respetar siempre esa camiseta del madrid que vestimos
6757548 es una decisi n del club porque tambi n ha venido rafa y entonces pienso que el madrid tiene una plantilla muy buena y la direcci n buscar lo mejor
6757549 fue una decisi n que ha venido despu s de un partido importante para nosotros pero ya he cumplido y no puedo decir m s nada porque antes estaba sancionado y no pude jugar ese partido ahora me toca encarar el pr ximo partido con muchas ganas y determinaci n pienso que no han tenido tiempo pero no veo que haya sido la decisi n para dejarme fuera de ese partido nosotros en el madrid aceptamos
6757550 es un bell simo jugador que tiene much sima calidad que poco a poco se va a ir soltando en el madrid y va a demostrar m s su valor no es f cil jugar aqu y el propio rafa sabe de eso espero que m s adelante pueda aparecer el rafa que estaba en el hamburgo y pienso que ha hecho un buen partido con el valencia y esperemos que d continuidad a su trabajo
6757551 estoy muy bien he ca do dentro del campo cuando est bamos muy cerca del final del partido pero ha sido una jugada normal
6757552 tenemos que tener mucha concentraci n y empezar a ganar un partido muy dif cil contra un buen equipo porque en casa tenemos que entrar muy bien

6757555 theres no question that if texas can maintain the horizontal and vertical depth in prospects that it has right now it will be able to compete with anyone when it comes to loading up for a blockbuster trade for a guy like kazmir
6757556 trading with the rays is like buying something for the person who has everything

6757579 the complete gutting of all interior space in the building from the ground floor and including the removal of the buildings roofs and of all internal building systems
6757580 however a demolition shall not require the removal of the outer walls and structural supports of a building
6757581 which we believe was the original intent of the statute
6757582 unfortunately the state legislature gave the owners this remedy for lack of a better word
6757583 could they do that and then put in luxury condos yes
6757584 the law wasnt intended to say heres a couple ways you can deregulate the unit
6757585 a tenant undergoing this process in my district would not be able to find another rent regulated apartment

6757599 says loud and clear to landlords you cannot sue community based organizations
6757600 if you do this you are going to get slappd
6757601 easily the most dilapidated poorly cared for buildings in the bronx
6757602 i did caution my staff to throw down what we were doing in about 50 apartment buildings
6757603 even though they only maybe listed five buildings in the lawsuit we basically stopped working in most of the buildings we were involved in because we were afraid they would be added on
6757604 could have been sold or it could have been moved to another management company owned by the same person
6757605 it became clear how deeply the landlords were threatened by tenant organizing it was almost inspiring because it suggested that people can get together and fight for repairs
6757606 i will say it as a priest of god for this community i used to serve in bay ridge for four years and this process would not have happened this way in bay ridge
6757607 any of us in here can be homeless especially in this time and age
6757608 the condition of the shelters in brooklyn is atrocious and that is something that needs to be addressed

6757611 perhaps real world climate sensitivity is very much below the ipccs estimates perhaps therefore there is no climate crisis at all the correct policy approach to a non problem is to have the courage to do nothing
6757612 we have these fake queues at front of 20 stores around the country to drum up interest in the iphone
6757613 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6757614 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6757615 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6757616 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6757617 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6757618 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6757619 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6757620 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6757621 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6757622 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6757623 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6757624 if you trust every web site but not a government
6757625 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6757626 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6757627 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6757628 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6757629 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6757630 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6757631 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6757632 well actually the banks owns it we pay a mortgage
6757633 we begin with america votes and a new flash point perhaps in the presidential race and the simple question that may have led to a major blunder our senior political correspondent jake tapper joins us with more on the so called home front battle both of these candidates are caught up in good morning jake
6757634 good morning robin how many houses do you own my wife and i we own one well actually the bank owns it and we pay a mortgage but the reason im asking is this is the question the obama campaign wants you to be asking yourself as they seek to portray john mccain a man who owns more than one house as out of touch a simple question for senator john mccain from reporters from the politico
6757635 i think ill have my staff get to you theyll tell you about that its condominiums its further ill have them get to you
6757636 trying to use mccains apparent lack of knowledge of how many homes he owns as a seminal moment depicting the republican as out of touch
6757637 i suppose if you got seven maybe eight houses the economy looks fundamentally sound to you
6757638 obama is making the same charge in a tv ad
6757639 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6757640 dramani remains with lokomotiv until the end of the season
6757641 before you criticize someone walk a mile in their shoes that way youll be a mile from them and youll have their shoes
6757642 im trying as always to do the maximum i can to score as many points as possible
6757643 the job has become harder especially as toyota have recently been quicker than us whilst renault have also been very close
6757644 lately weve been behind ferrari and mclaren compared to where we were at the beginning of the season
6757645 if i had the quickest car then i would say yes i am still in it because everything can all change very quickly
6757646 i hope things will improve this weekend and if not then it will be difficult

6757654 researchers have been working on such super resolution microscopy concepts for electrons and x rays for many years
6757655 only the construction of a dedicated multi million swiss franc instrument at psis swiss light source allowed us to achieve the stability that is necessary to implement our novel method in practice
6757656 we developed an image reconstruction algorithm that deals with the several tens of thousands of diffraction images and combines them into one super resolution x ray micrograph
6757657 in order to achieve images of the highest precision the algorithm not only reconstructs the sample but also the exact shape of the light probe resulting from the x ray beam
6757658 ser el mejor jugador del mundo y eso no es posible en el madrid
6757659 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6757660 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6757661 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
6757662 more proof of the vast left conspiracy out to stop hillary
6757663 he told us the promises you made for this year will be kept
6757664 how it is done exactly im not sure but i assume he has a rainy day fund
6757665 weve started the season with two victories and we want to keep that run going
6757666 it was disappointing not to win the league there last season but that match is already out of our system we just have to win this game now
6757667 mikael came to see me at the end of last season and says he wanted first team football
6757668 i agreed with him hes given me nine years good service and there was no point holding a player who lost his position to patrice evra
6757669 hes given great service to me and is a really nice lad a great professional
6757670 he was more or less conducting his own affairs we knew the price we wanted and we notified him of the clubs showing an interest namely sunderland were the main ones
6757671 he went up there on friday i believe to discuss the move and came back very positive about that then manchester city came onto the scene he went there and was having a medical
6757672 he was halfway through it but got to go to london and ended up at arsenal
6757673 i havent really spoken to him they knew the price we wanted and that was taken care of and hes joined arsenal ive no complaints at all
6757674 hes been a great servant and we wish him well i couldve been selfish and said youve given us nine years but youll be a reserve for the rest of your contract
6757675 these results prove that most americans want to be fair to gay people our aspiration is to always see each other as individuals first and though we may not always succeed at that our underlying fairness and decency means that one day soon we will this marks tremendous progress for our community and for the voting public

6757703 die globalisierung schreitet mit schnellen schritten voran und die welt w chst jeden tag ein st ckchen weiter zusammen und nat rlich wollen wir uns nicht auf brands aus den usa und gro britannien fixieren denn auch wenn das angebot an wirklich guten streetwear brands dort am gr ten ist gibt es auch in anderen l ndern echte streetwear perlen und gerade die skandinavischen l nder werden in diesem bereich immer st rker

6757715 robotic ground vehicle projects will be responsible for at least 109 new local jobs in southeast michigan by next year and perhaps more than double that by the middle of the next decade according to defense contractors and military officers at two robotics conferences held in troy and ann arbor last week
6757716 weve been doing a bit of hiring and transferring from within tar ank automotive research development and engineering center in warren but were also managing to hire some good people who came over from the automotive industry
6757717 the region has lost a good deal of manufacturing and blue collar jobs but southeast michigan still remains the capital of innovation in the worlds auto industry this is one of many ways to leverage that talent
6757718 about 1 700 robotic units thus far have been furnished by bedford mass based irobot corp our customer is there said nancy smith vice president of marketing for irobot so it is important to be positioned to confer with and respond to them on a daily basis

6757725 possessing and consuming alcoholic beverages is against the law under the age of 21 and we are all obliged to uphold the law the current law has not prevented alcohol from being available and drinking is widespread at all american colleges and at younger ages as well
6757726 but at colleges and universities the law does have other effects it pushes drinking into hiding heightening its risks including risks from drunken driving and it prevents us from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
6757727 discover how i get unlimited ppc credits and adwords vouchers for
6757728 a great entertainment value not only for our own students but also for the local community
6757729 using both high and low tech means many institutions across the country have already adopted this approach and are issuing campuswide emergency notifications

6757738 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6757739 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6757740 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6757741 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6757742 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6757743 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6757744 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6757745 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6757746 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6757747 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6757748 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6757749 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6757750 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6757751 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6757752 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6757753 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6757754 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6757755 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6757756 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6757757 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6757758 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6757759 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6757760 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6757761 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6757762 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6757763 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6757764 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6757765 you cant call yourselves the doors because you cant have the doors without jim morrison
6757766 while the three partners had agreed to the commercial morrison vehemently disagreed and the commercial was not done

6757770 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6757771 this nation was built on a foundation of free speech the first principle of free speech is protected conscience
6757772 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6757773 fails to give assurances that current laws about abortion will not be stretched to cover birth control
6757774 this proposal ensures that doctors and other medical personnel will retain the constitutional right to listen to their own conscience when it comes to performing or participating in an abortion
6757775 these regulations will ensure that pro life medical personnel will not be forced to engage in the unconscionable killing of innocent human life
6757776 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6757777 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6757778 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
6757779 vytorins effectiveness has been in doubt and now its safety is questionable
6757780 that sir petos work in this matter has somehow been influenced by the companies is insulting to him and entirely untrue
6757781 nobody should avoid taking a statin because of concerns about cancer
6757782 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
6757783 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6757784 dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee
6757785 instead of invoking paris britney and obscure sixties radicals sen
6757786 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old
6757787 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6757788 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines
6757789 you can measure the lengths of individual molecules and the average will be a pretty good description of any one
6757790 are all over the place theyre so diverse that its difficult to get one measurement that describes all of the possible structures
6757791 generated lots and lots of structures for both normal tau and a mutant form
6757792 we have a number of banks that are still under investigation and we are obviously having conversations about resolution the one thing the people want is their money back quickly
6757793 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6757794 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6757795 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6757796 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6757797 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6757798 in belgium beer is a national pastime there are over 140 breweries and 600 brands the couple was able to convince some of belgiums best brewers that had never had u s distribution to give them an import agreement they moved to the united states and started from scratch
6757799 ultimately we found the ideal partners were two individuals with specific experience and expertise they not only brought their experience but also capital to the partnership which brought some liquidity to the founders and an orderly ownership transition over time
6757800 steve knew that the high end product was where the action is in the beer market these days
6757801 and he knew that belgium beer in particular is at the top of the food chain
6757802 he had come across the global beer opportunity and really loved it
6757803 he is a sales and marketing manager not really a finance and operating manager so he showed it to me and i thought it was great opportunity
6757804 i think johnny and claudine needed some other people and talent to take it to the next level
6757805 they couldnt leave the office theyd be lucky if they saw a customer every three years steves goal as the new president is to see every customer every quarter
6757806 we have more than 42 fantastic products and over a dozen are award winning gold medal beers in national competition
6757807 it had been a husband and wife operation villianis beer expertise enables the company to become a more professional operation thats not to take away anything from johnny and claudine they did a great job but steves had a lot of training working his way through the management ranks of anheuser busch plus belgium beer is the industrys fastest import category so they have incredible opportunities
6757808 we are keen on building a global enterprise that leverages the top entertainment content across the globe
6757809 our recent deals in the entertainment space convey our focus and commitment towards building global entertainment equity
6757810 the idea is to expand the mobile entertainment umbrella for jump in the mobile space via strong and sustained growth both organic as well as inorganic
6757811 who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies
6757812 do not worry about anything but pray and ask god for everything you need always giving thanks and gods peace which is so great we cannot understand it will keep your hearts and minds in christ jesus
6757813 she says that there are times she has every right to feel offended by some of the things her husband does but she doesnt take the opportunity to do so she keeps her mouth quiet in order to maintain peace and unity besides 95 of the time the problem is us not our hubbies and if it is our hubby its not up to us to change his ways or his attitudes
6757814 since we have these promises dear friends let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit perfecting holiness out of reverence for god
6757815 as always we remind students and parents of the limitations of these and other rankings which they should use as only one source of information as they engage with the college application process

6757830 unlike credit card fraud where you can go back and seize that toaster or lcd television they bought how do you go back in there and get somebodys heart
6757831 this is the first time in my 12 years ive seen anything like this
6757832 you cant just walk in with somebodys medicaid card like its a credit card and have heart surgery done
6757833 a doctor would need to know blood type cardiac history medical history and other comprehensive records that just couldnt be faked this doesnt make sense
6757834 when this was brought to our attention by police we immediately launched a review
6757835 this gentleman apparently took pretty significant steps to steal this mans identity were taking all the precautions we can
6757836 he had a hard time and had been very sick
6757837 i think people do what they have to do sometimes
6757838 this is the fastest growing form of identity theft in america today
6757839 with almost 50 million people considered uninsured today medical identity theft may become a growing problem as more people become desperate enough to turn to crime to find treatments that they can not otherwise get
6757840 how hard do you think it is for me to go on the internet and come up with a sample of your health insurance card which i turn around and photoshop with the information i want on it
6757841 medical identity theft is just really beginning to seep into health care providers awareness
6757842 lets dream big lets dream positive lets be determine and committed lets not forget our values and ethics lets be firmly grounded to our roots and let success follow us
6757843 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6757844 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6757845 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6757846 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6757847 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6757848 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6757849 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6757850 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6757851 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6757852 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6757853 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6757854 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6757855 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6757856 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6757857 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6757858 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6757859 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6757860 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6757861 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6757862 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6757863 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6757864 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6757865 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6757866 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6757867 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6757868 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6757869 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6757870 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6757871 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6757872 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6757873 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6757874 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6757875 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6757876 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6757877 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6757878 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6757879 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6757880 this is a planning took where all things are going
6757881 larger percentage of patients treated with vytorin were diagnosed with and died from all combined when compared to treatment with a placebo
6757882 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6757883 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment
6757884 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6757885 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher
6757886 this is especially true of cancers involving the but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6757887 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers

6757890 how fair would it be if consultants who are supposed to negotiate these agreements on our behalf are paid by the eu our negotiating partners
6757891 the epas are fundamentally an extension of the same neo liberal policies africa and other developing regions have been coerced to adopt in the last three decades
6757892 i havent seen the movie and i wont go see the movie because of what ive heard but i want to add my two cents to the opinions on whether its offensive to the mentally challenged
6757893 i know ben stiller has said that hes making fun of actors not people with disabilities still the movie is geared toward a younger crowd and i fear a lot of those teenagers and college students will leave the theater thinking r ard is an okay word to use its not its taken years to get people to stop using that word

6757896 in recent days additional questions have resurfaced and in the interests of laying the matter to rest and in response to a request from the international olympic committee the fig has now asked the chinese gymnastic association to submit further documents testifying to the birth dates of the gymnasts
6757897 on receipt of these documents the fig will forward its conclusions to the international olympic committee it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6757898 there have been questions that have been on the table and discrepancies that have been alluded to by certain parties
6757899 the ioc is wanting to do its due diligence and work with certain parties to 100 percent clarify this situation and put it to rest thats whats in the process of being done
6757900 i think theres a great concern and i think its a concern out of fairness for the individual athletes on the american team whether or not its fair to them that the athletes were under age
6757901 we really have a concern for the integrity of the competition on both sides if theyre of age they should be exonerated and if theyre not we would hope it would be put to bed
6757902 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6757903 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6757904 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6757905 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6757906 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6757907 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6757908 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6757909 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6757910 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6757911 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6757912 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6757913 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6757914 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6757915 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6757916 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6757917 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6757918 its not the size of the dog in the fight its the size of the fight in the dog
6757919 u s small companies are a contrarian place to be right now
6757920 most people are still stuck on that large company bandwagon but quietly small companies are outperforming
6757921 we liked the strategy but we didnt think the timing was right in terms of where they were in the cycle
6757922 no i dont sleep until i do and then i fall down asleep like a ton of bricks
6757923 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6757924 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6757925 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6757926 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6757927 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6757928 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
6757929 we are aware of the logon problems but we have no comment at the moment
6757930 it seems like suspending itunes is punishment for itunes but really it doesnt hurt itunes it hurts us
6757931 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the chinese government
6757932 theyre incredibly supportive people they wouldnt do anything like that
6757933 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet
6757934 the power pack for your laptop isnt that efficient its one of those things thats almost too good to be true
6757935 for me its like a confirmation that its so exciting its something people would like to have
6757936 now the question is if its feasible or not its exciting that theyre also inspired and it seems closer to reality every day
6757937 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6757938 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6757939 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6757940 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6757941 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6757942 like a lot of teachers there now i figured how bad could it be i was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005
6757943 i became very very sick my immune system shut down i collapsed and was bedridden for several months
6757944 i wouldnt have kids in the school if i didnt think it was safe i would close the school
6757945 i do think there are areas of that school that continue to be dangerous
6757946 you can go most anyplace and build a school on top of a superfund site
6757947 they can build a school anywhere they want really and thats the sad truth i think at schools very little has changed and thats unfortunate
6757948 the children would actually pick up these chemicals and handle them
6757949 so for example one of these things was phosphorous rocks phosphorous rocks were little pieces of chemical residue that would bubble up to the surface the children would pick up these phosphorous rocks and when you threw them at a hard surface they would explode like a firecracker
6757950 i have a high school education i dont have a science degree but you dont have to be a scientist to know that 20 000 tons of chemicals and kindergartners dont mix
6757951 hes not dane cook hes got a more sophisticated everyday take on things he often comes across as a questioner of conventional wisdom but also can be kind of a crank its a fine line to walk when youre dealing with a younger person
6757952 ive never been uncomfortable with that aspect i dont feel like its beneath me to sell what i did
6757953 i think its unfair to say that i did anything that wasnt aboveboard
6757954 it is hard to compete at an olympic level when you do not get any support from the government
6757955 we need to improve and reform several sectors in cambodias education programs
6757956 part of this improvement should be in sports education which is an important part of the personal development of young people who are the future of our nation people have the tendency to forget cambodia is a nation on the rise and need to give it some time to grow
6757957 if we could get sponsored we could go somewhere with sports in cambodia but the government is not going to support us because they are busy with other things
6757958 i work really hard but do not even have the basic things i need like nutritious food to eat or clothes for training
6757959 the government needs to reform sports and give it a more reliable structure
6757960 from supporting the training and finances of an olympic athlete to building industrial parks and helping cambodia become a leading rice exporter we want to invest in areas that cambodians take pride in
6757961 the next five years will be the time investment takes off in cambodia and the country starts to put itself on the map
6757962 you will see a major change in the country and things like sports which have been overlooked because of the lack of government support may start to receive some funding from the private sector
6757963 i would not have gotten a good education if it had not been for the foreigners who came to my village and started a school
6757964 the days of the khmer rouge are over now and the youth in cambodia face different challenges like how to become socially conscious and have a voice in the development of their country
6757965 cambodia is not competitive in sports education or most jobs right now because we dont have any competition and little opportunity in the country
6757966 but i think with the right support this could change
6757967 i lived in cambodia for five years in the early 90s
6757968 the city has transformed with buildings paved roads and soon skyscrapers but what has not changed that much are the schools i would like to know how much investment is going back in to education
6757969 for example as investors build more hotels in the country others may start to invest in hotel management schools and language schools cambodia will gradually produce more skilled english speaking workers
6757970 being an athlete and just trying to live in cambodia is not easy
6757971 but i think in several years it could get better
6757972 the important thing is not to win but to take part
6757973 instead of complaining about where cambodia is we need to have a collective vision for where the country is going lets meet up again eight years from now and see where cambodia and her athletes are
6757974 there were many tense expeditions when we were in close proximity to soviet submarines and ships
6757975 being on a sub it was constantly impressed upon us who the enemy was there would be little posters reminding us to be quiet if you accidentally closed a hatch or door too hard that sound could actually emit out into the water and give your position away
6757976 for about two weeks we were in the north atlantic in a covert area and it was necessary to remain at periscope depth which is 50 feet under water
6757977 it was hard to stay at that depth without breaking the surface and giving away our position it was extremely tense for those two weeks wed spend six hour watches in the control room just leaning over the steering mechanism with our eyes glued to the gauges as the sub bobbed up and down in the water another time we were discovered by the soviets and had to make a quick getaway
6757978 it was as close to the real thing as we could get
6757979 we had the missile launchers ready and we were all manned up we could go to war at a seconds notice not a minutes notice
6757980 while we were doing it we were using our radar to look into russia but of course we didnt tell them that
6757981 i said were not going out on deck we dont know if theyre shooting or what we checked every missile and it was the only time that ive ever seen the ready to load light steady on the monitor we sat there for a long time and eventually the captain came on and said what happened and to stand down
6757982 you lived under an air of suspicion and intrigue at the same time
6757983 being young soldiers you also had an air of cockiness about you and you felt invincible
6757984 but later i found out that this happened on a regular basis
6757985 you lived your normal life and did your job but you always looked over your shoulder wondering if you were being followed and you had to be careful what you said now as someone thats more stable in life i wonder how we lived through that but back then we loved what we were doing every soldier there was ready to do everything he could to preserve freedom
6757986 for the older georgians who remember the soviet domination i think theyre scared to death that its all going to come back
6757987 everything from communism to the social injustice and tyranny that marked that era it upsets me also because ive seen what its like for three years behind the wall and if you havent lived it you dont know what it is
6757988 regardless of who started the conflict between russia and georgia russia is taking their time to leave
6757989 if youve ever seen the dark shadow of old world communism before the wall fell its scary we had a saying when you went into east berlin you set your watch back 20 years they were that oppressed and a lot of them didnt even realize it
6757990 we had the opportunity to see how the other side lived and i actually enjoyed the experience i think it gives you a different outlook on life you dont take everything for granted and sometimes theres a price to be paid for things its a shame that we have to have it but when somebody threatens your lifestyle theres an opportunity to protect it
6757991 large companies are putting together server farms of tens of thousands of computers even approaching 100 thousand and the big challenge is to interconnect all these computers so that they can talk to each other as quickly as possible without incurring significant costs
6757992 we are proposing a new topology for ethernet data center connectivity
6757993 our work addresses the problem of data center network connectivity in a world where consolidation is increasingly taking place in data centers
6757994 the history of computing and technology has an innumerable set of examples where commodity parts take over the functionality of more specialized pieces of equipment
6757995 but that commoditization hasnt taken place on the communications side so we do have these specialized components still living in the network infrastructure that incur significant costs and complexity
6757996 the other issue is that people are treating the data center as a mini internet
6757997 thats fine but they are then forced to use the same components they might use in the wide area network with a bunch of concerns that dont come up in the data center environment adversarial environments attacks parties that might not trust each other etc so you have a lot of functionalities in these specialized switching components that you really dont need in your data center and you wind up paying for it in dollars and in complexity
6757998 independent of whether our technique is successful or someone elses is five years from now switching and communication infrastructure in the datacenter will be based on these small commodity building blocks
6757999 one of the big benefits of our approach is that it scales trivially to 10 gige at the edge whereas competing techniques rely on aggregation to ever faster links to achieve higher speeds
6758000 if you were to go to 10 gige at the edge for servers today you would need to aggregate to 40 gige or 100 gigelinks moving up the tree topology unfortunately the 40gbps ethernet standard isnt even out yet and when it does become available it will be very expensive because were using identical network elements in our topology today 48 port 10 gige ethernet switches are becoming relatively inexpensive so we would scale trivially to that environment as well
6758001 from a cost perspective to build out a 25 000 node cluster today using current techniques with 100 percent bandwidth just the switching equipment would cost somewhere in the order of 28 million whereas with our technique using the identical network elements would deliver the same performance but incur costs of maybe 4 million thats a factor of seven difference
6758002 its possible it could become the something molineux stadium emirates are paying arsenal about 50million over 15 years and if we get serious sponsorship it would be idiotic not to consider it
6758003 were talking to an occupier who wants to lease part of the stadium and that would give us significant revenue
6758004 that would be at least a 15 year rent and would be a catalyst for stage one of our redevelopment irrespective of whether we win promotion
6758005 the redevelopment work will be done incrementally because the last thing id want is a 35 40 000 stadium and have it half full
6758006 the capacity would probably increase by 2 3 000 each time we did a stand
6758007 there are no obvious replacements unless you go the edge of the city transport communications are good with parking and public transport and we benefit the city economy
6758008 molineux is the right place but its not without problems when it comes to redevelopment
6758009 im a builder so construction is close to my heart there will be great consideration and i always want molineux to look a great stadium

6758067 hes given great service to me and is a really nice lad a great professional
6758068 he was more or less conducting his own affairs we knew the price we wanted and we notified him of the clubs showing an interest namely sunderland were the main ones
6758069 he went up there on friday i believe to discuss the move and came back very positive about that then manchester city came onto the scene he went there and was having a medical

6758092 i would play all these small places in new york where a lot of young musicians get their start
6758093 i would do whatever i could do to get people talking about my music a couple of years into it we could get like 300 or 400 people to show up at new york music venue s o b s but at first we were happy to get like 50 or 60 or 70 people to show up

6758096 john legend is a nickname that some friends started calling me and it kind of grew into my stage name
6758097 legend is something that i never would have chosen for myself originally it grew to the point where more people in my circle would know me by that name than by my real name i had to make a decision
6758098 my bet was on me trying to live up to the name
6758099 kanye was still grinding it out when i was grinding it out
6758100 we did a show at s o b s and the crowd was definitely getting restless while he was performing
6758101 its hard to play a live show when people have no idea who you are i knew he was going to be great and was going to be a big star but at the time no one knew little did they know who he was going to be
6758102 you will not make it in this business and succeed over a long period of time unless you work really hard
6758103 i had to learn as i went when i was grinding and it does make you appreciate your success it makes you realize that its really about the work its really about making the best music you can make its really about working hard
6758104 at the end of the day theres only a few major stars in the music business and then theres all these people that are aspiring to be that
6758105 when we recorded it we just tried to get the songs sounding as good as they possibly could and there are two songs wed never recorded that are on this record
6758106 we had talked about doing another record and theres another record on the table under our contract with metal blade we can do it if we want if we dont whatever but we have discussed doing another record and im kind of excited about tinkering with ideas for it that said if we did start writing a new album and it wasnt turning out like an overcast record i dont think wed put it out it really needs to have a certain vibe it cant be another metalcore record like the things that are going on these days it really needs to have that old school mentality which we had held true back then if not its not even worth it
6758107 we didnt want to change it too much and we didnt want it to sound like a different band
6758108 at the same time we didnt want to give fans the exact same record but we did want it to feel like the same band some of the stuff was recorded the way wed played the songs live because when youve played something 100 000 times you end up tweaking it changing it slightly so the new album reflects some of the older songs and how we used to play them live back then
6758109 im one of those dudes who needs to write constantly because i really suck at writing music with a deadline
6758110 my brain gets fried and i cant do anything i just shut down completely when we start on this next one well just bring our demos to practice and well listen to them judge them and start rearranging the parts that need to be rearranged or we just start jamming on what sounds cool

6758151 it would be a rush if it wasnt ready i suppose but in terms of the recording we finished it in late june early july but the way media can be disseminated these days we figured if its finished then its ready to be heard i think certainly if wed decided to go the other route the cd being the first thing people heard i think we would have had to have a conversation about how we might tackle that this time around obviously the internet is such a tool for people so a lot of people dont think twice about going online to try and find music so why not use that to your advantage i suppose
6758152 we had one foot on each island as it were and in a way we were trying to remember whats been the heart of what we do
6758153 if anything with the second record there was a bit of a compromise behind it in that we were trying to marry up the two elements and not quite landing on either sort of level i suppose so why not just take it a bit further in each direction and actually follow it through a bit further
6758154 i think we just wanted to revisit some of the ways of working wed enjoyed and be a bit more choosy about where we split the various talents of those two guys and marry it up with the songs we had at that point
6758155 its a bit more disjointed in terms of the continuity it was just a different approach but im not sure if it was better or worse just a different attack and one that suited this record

6758159 i was deciding between michigan and notre dame but there was really no choice
6758160 i had wanted to go to notre dame since i first put on a football helmet when i was 7 years old it was truly a dream come true for me
6758161 i think that the high demands from both football and the academic requirements make notre dame a tough place to have success at with that said having been able to meet those challenges and succeed has made me stronger and more able to deal with the rigors of an nfl season it also gave me the ability to persevere through the tough periods in my life and my career so far
6758162 i have so may but there two that come to mind first when we played nebraska in a huge game my junior i believe we were ranked 2 and they were 1 i remember the excitement of that game and how badly i wanted to win it
6758163 unfortunately we didnt win but that was a game for the ages
6758164 another one of my great memories was when coach bob davie announced to the team that i was going to be one of the captains my senior year i got out of the meeting ran to the phone in the joyce center and called my dad and told him we both shed some tears because it was the biggest honor of my life ill never forget it
6758165 i dont keep in close touch with many of the guys but its always good to see guys i played with at nd who are still in the nfl like and tony weaver to name a few we always talk before the game for a little nd catch up
6758166 i do expect them to rebound because thats what notre dame does nd can only be down so long
6758167 a program thats been around for that long and has had the timeless success they have had will get back on top
6758168 nd has had so much success over so many years that jealousy comes into play
6758169 as hard as notre dame was i would do it all over again
6758170 i experienced many great things learned many valuable life lessons and made the best friends of my life
6758171 if this is published every time he gets up to sing they will shout a horrible word at him you know what i mean
6758172 thats not the publicity we want you cant give us publicity like that after all its not rickys fault is it
6758173 were not in the business of giving ricky good publicity this is supposed to be a newspaper we print what we think people will be interested in
6758174 for years you have been feeding us your cooked up rubbish about rickys ties and his favourite dishes and we published it because deluded editors thought it was interesting ricky got rich in the process and you seem to be doing all right yourself
6758175 now weve got something which is even more interesting maybe rickys income will go down but thats no concern of ours were not here to build him up in the first place those who live by publicity cant squeal if they die by publicity can they
6758176 your attack and aggressiveness might even qualify you for an editors chair one day on the right kind of paper but to be frank with you i doubt that you have the suppleness to slip under the barriers which lie between
6758177 perhaps its a kind of sensitivity i have in mind your puritanical outbursts for example strictly speaking its not your place to have them at all or at least show them but ours is not an authoritarian organisation and we are prepared to overlook a great deal in a promising man settling in however beyond a certain point they impose an unwanted strain on those who are unlucky enough to be your superiors a man who is going to succeed must sense these tensions and desist before it is too late
6758178 simply to do what you are told will never qualify you to give orders to others that is the outlook of the hack and the place for hacks is on the bottom rung they must be changed frequently too before they have a chance to make themselves indispensable rather as barnacles are periodically scraped off ships
6758179 you mustnt do what youre told and you mustnt annoy the boss by objecting what youre told to do

6758183 hes supposed to be responsible for keeping the libels out but of course the papers one long libel from end to end and they dont show him any of the fancy heads or pictures they slide in at the last minute
6758184 he cant do much about it because barr the editor is the boss and if the lawyers propped at every potential libel theyd be out of the job inside a week so what it comes down to is theyre paid for worrying

6758187 a draconian warning guardian co uk guardian news and media limited 2008
6758188 large companies are putting together server farms of tens of thousands of computers even approaching 100 thousand and the big challenge is to interconnect all these computers so that they can talk to each other as quickly as possible without incurring significant costs
6758189 we are proposing a new topology for ethernet data center connectivity
6758190 our work addresses the problem of data center network connectivity in a world where consolidation is increasingly taking place in data centers
6758191 the history of computing and technology has an innumerable set of examples where commodity parts take over the functionality of more specialized pieces of equipment
6758192 but that commoditization hasnt taken place on the communications side so we do have these specialized components still living in the network infrastructure that incur significant costs and complexity
6758193 the other issue is that people are treating the data center as a mini internet
6758194 thats fine but they are then forced to use the same components they might use in the wide area network with a bunch of concerns that dont come up in the data center environment adversarial environments attacks parties that might not trust each other etc so you have a lot of functionalities in these specialized switching components that you really dont need in your data center and you wind up paying for it in dollars and in complexity
6758195 independent of whether our technique is successful or someone elses is five years from now switching and communication infrastructure in the datacenter will be based on these small commodity building blocks
6758196 one of the big benefits of our approach is that it scales trivially to 10 gige at the edge whereas competing techniques rely on aggregation to ever faster links to achieve higher speeds
6758197 if you were to go to 10 gige at the edge for servers today you would need to aggregate to 40 gige or 100 gigelinks moving up the tree topology unfortunately the 40gbps ethernet standard isnt even out yet and when it does become available it will be very expensive because were using identical network elements in our topology today 48 port 10 gige ethernet switches are becoming relatively inexpensive so we would scale trivially to that environment as well
6758198 from a cost perspective to build out a 25 000 node cluster today using current techniques with 100 percent bandwidth just the switching equipment would cost somewhere in the order of 28 million whereas with our technique using the identical network elements would deliver the same performance but incur costs of maybe 4 million thats a factor of seven difference

6758208 they try to run a spread offense and theyre going to do a lot of blitzing and zone blitzing and things like that you cant take them lightly you got to make sure your doing all the solid things on defense and picking up the blitzes on offense
6758209 you will never find a milli vanilli in the world of metal
6758210 it is synergy and team play that differentiates the truly great band or team from all the pretenders to the throne
6758211 this is the fuel that propels both heavy metal music and the sport of hockey it is required to fashion a meaningful performance in either arena
6758212 when you scratch the surface hockey and heavy metal music heck any kind of music have more similarities than you might think
6758213 the kids are getting better every week everytime they play there is some improvement
6758214 so when we play teams our own calibre weve done well
6758215 we just dont know what to expect because teams change from year to year
6758216 we just have to go in thinking each game will be our toughest game of the year
6758217 in tournaments like this its all or nothing there is no secondary goal
6758218 it just shows we can play with anybody if we play our top game
6758219 we just hope we can get on a roll and ride that
6758220 we want to get started with a win in that first game and go from there
6758221 many spooky edinburgh lore and gore tours retell the spurious fakelore of edinburgh
6758222 these tours are incredibly popular we run history tours as well but it is the ghost tours which are the most popular because people like to hear stories
6758223 on our tour i dont think of the poltergeist section as entertainment but as educational the mackenzie poltergeist was written about by robert louis stevenson and if its good enough for him its good enough for me
6758224 we take this very seriously all of our guides have to have a history degree
6758225 horror stories have always been fascinating to people and they have always endured which is probably why these tours are so popular
6758226 we are a tourist city and these are tourist attractions but i think some of the blood and gore used in their advertising could be toned down
6758227 the concern is that there are more and more of them and if they start drifting away from the facts just to entertain then it does become a problem
6758228 there is an actor who plays a mad monk on one tour and he leaps out at people ringing a bell every night just underneath my flat that can get quite annoying
6758229 i actually quite like the tours though ive listened to the guides before and been surprised at how much detailed history there is
6758230 i was surprised to read sir seans comments particularly since as far as i know he has never visited the attraction
6758231 we are privileged to present a unique piece of edinburghs heritage and do so with great care
6758232 presenting a balanced and holistic picture with accurate reflection is key to telling this story
6758233 it is a fact that witches were burned at edinburgh castle it is part of scotlands past
6758234 it is the worst flooding we have had for some years
6758235 there was about one and a half feet of water going down the street and it just came in through the front door
6758236 people started trying to move their cars out of the street but it had a tidal wave effect
6758237 the whole road was like a bed of water from one wall to the other wall
6758238 network rail are investigating the extent of the damage and we are working very closely with them to make sure we can get services back as quickly as possible
6758239 at this stage we do not have any further detail of when we will be able to operate services
6758240 there are worse crimes than burning books one of them is not reading them
6758241 i suspect that he will only begin to provide information of genuine value if he comes to believe that it is genuinely in his interests to do so i dont think he has yet reached this point
6758242 the world and most zimbabweans pray for a free and fair election not marred by violence and intimidation as in the past
6758243 we urge the sadc observers to produce a report characterised by integrity and honestly we have let down the suffering people of zimbabwe for too long already they deserve better
6758244 since the runoff was announced the violence in zimbabwe has gotten even worse zimbabweans cant vote freely if they fear their vote may get them killed
6758245 we resolved that no further executive powers will be given to tsvangirai
6758246 members were adamant that what he has been offered is enough and the issue of president mugabe maintaining his present executive powers is non negotiable
6758247 we were informed the sadc supports us in the deal including botswana i cant give you full details on the talks but we were fully briefed
6758248 if you convene parliament you are closing the door to negotiations
6758249 we are going to parliament to defend our mandate our problem is with the convening of parliament not the swearing in of members

6758367 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
6758368 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers

6758405 but by the same token we know these very same people are not interested in less religiosity in the political discourse they almost universally want a religious person as president
6758406 its not that they want to take religion out of politics its that their frustrations with the way things seem to be going are leading them to say well maybe churches should back off on this

6758413 in present day america so it looks to me the affluent majority is striving desperately to arrest the irresistible tide of change it is attempting this impossible task because it is bent on conserving the social and economic system under which this comfortable affluence has been acquired with this unattainable aim in view american public opinion today is putting an enormously high premium on social conformity and this attempt to standardize peoples behavior in adult life is as discouraging to creative ability and initiative as the educational policy of egalitarianism in childhood
6758414 to give a fair chance to potential creativity is a matter of life and death for any society
6758415 it requires not only tolerance and discernment but also great moral courage
6758416 civilizations in decline are consistently characterised by a tendency towards standardization and uniformity

6758419 people are increasingly troubled about the change in relationship between the individual citizen and the structure of society the whole idea of a democratic government is simple enough and straightforward enough that the individual citizen should be able to understand the essentials of it therefore he should be able to elect a president or representatives who will represent what he believes to be the right policy of that country also he should be able to keep track of what his elected president and representatives do and to influence them or perhaps impel them by peaceful methods to change their policy
6758420 a politically unchallenged president is a sign of some shift in the balance of power due to the increasing scale of society and the increasing complication of all social and political transactions i think weve got to find some way of making the individual citizen effective again under these new and much more difficult conditions

6758438 no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
6758439 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6758440 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6758441 lots of people are saying this club resemble chelsea and i believe the situation looks like what happened there
6758442 they are one of the best teams in the world and hopefully qpr can be a new chelsea
6758443 playing for the best team in the world which is real madrid is every players aim but you never know where you are going to end up
6758444 if i cant make it there i would be delighted to succeed in the premier league
6758445 my personal objective is to become a better player a better person as its an adventure year for me the lads have been great with me very welcoming as soon as i arrived
6758446 i love english football they live it in another way the fans are great and the stadiums are full even if its second division games
6758447 i have an option to stay for another year if the club go up and if madrid want me to stay but if not im going to return to madrid
6758448 there has been a good mood around the club and certainly andy johnsons signing helped that
6758449 everyone will be looking at being clear of relegation by february march time as a good thing theyre not too hopeful but i think a 13th place finish would leave them all happy on top of that a cup run would give them something to be excited about i think as far as fulham are concerned that would be a success the club are building towards something rather than being at an end product now
6758450 the board has given roy big money this summer what is key is that hodgson goes about things very differently to sanchez and i think his approach that is much more convincing certainly i think fayed will believe in hodgson after the good pre season and wont panic if things arent going too well in october fayed has put a lot of money into the club and i think he would only force his hand if fulham looked like they were really dying out in the premier league like has happened in the past chris coleman came in and saved them sanchez did the same and of course roy did that last season i wouldnt rule it out happening again but there is the hope that roy is the man to avoid that situation
6758451 andy johnson is an exciting signing but there is some concern already because he isnt fit his transfer took a while to go through and it isnt completely clear why that was he has a thigh strain and wont play against arsenal so there is a concern if he can stay fit then without doubt he is the signing fulham has been waiting for since louis saha left for manchester united when saha left fulham sort of died in a way with no striker to get excited by every time the ball came into the box andy johnson could be that player he did it at crystal palace not so much at everton because they played a different style and now he will here he will suit the way of playing much more for once it is nice to have a star of the show a big money signing a player that gets you excited and gives you hope of getting a goal from nothing
6758452 the club are hopeful that bobby zamora and johnson will compliment each other although they havent had a chance to work on that yet
6758453 zoltan gera is a really good signing and he came on a free as well i think he could have gone to any premier league club as a squad player he brings balance to the side something that was missing before and what is also useful is that him and davies can swap flanks gera has a clever way of thinking can pull off the pass no one was thinking about and with a player like andy johnson up front he will just thrive off that kind of service i dont know if gera will score too many but he will certainly create quite a few he is an exciting signing and one that has passed under the radar on a free he is a great signing
6758454 it will be a strange one for jimmy bullard i think this season not helped with the speculation about his future i think he will stay and it will be interesting to see how he and danny murphy combine the manager has pointed out the pair are similar in build and the way they play and he wants a bigger type of player to take the defensive side of things on board so i am not sure how much jimmy will actually play as the season goes on but what jimmy brings is of course his set pieces and his enthusiasm it is that the fans really love and it is why they are disappointed to see him being linked with a move away at the tail end of last season his enthusiasm spurred everyone on to believe that they could do it he scored a couple and his free kicks and set up a few more but its really his character that makes him so great to have around i dont think anyone believes jimmy is the best footballer in the team because he is not he has something that no one else can bring and that alone is worth so much to fulham that is why they want to keep hold of him
6758455 there was a big problem with depth last season but i think there is a much better squad in place now looking at the players roy has bought in he has used his scandinavian connections we dont know a great deal about those players but when you watch them you see they are very technical so the team are certainly better equipped than last season they do need to hope none of there big name players get injured because mcbride and bullard going so early last term killed them basically

6758467 i think that it is yet to early to talk about it but knowing the events and how russia behaves it is of course obvious tha such thoughts occur
6758468 at the moment the tension is still high but we want to believe in logical mind that russia will eventually stops using power and starts to solve problems in the more civilized manner
6758469 if all that polital situation would calm down the song will be sent to the contest but if russia continues to showase power and ignores international rules i do not deny the possibility that other countries might think about it as well then we shall see what is the situation
6758470 on the other hand knowing that moscow i guess so and having in mind historical sources will surely use the contest for propaganda and showcase some particular russia values which are not always compatible with western worlds i would say that there is a need to think if it is worth participating at all then
6758471 our priorities this year are different we are concentrating on the contest
6758472 ubiquitous and deliver services that will touch every aspect of our lives
6758473 management is pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement to provide 4000 pin debit and prepaid cards to a canadian financial service provider in canada with online and retail services this is additional from the 9000 with kiyss com
6758474 originally we anticipated 200 students participating in master the mainframe however we ended up having more than 450 students sign up for the event
6758475 this demonstrates the continued interest in mainframe computing particularly in an it environment where there is a lot of pressure to consolidate and reduce space the mainframe is a great platform in terms of scale performance and energy efficiency
6758476 i took part in this contest because it provided me with a challenge
6758477 i liked part 3 of the contest as it involved lots of different technologies and things that can be done using ibm mainframes such as issuing unix commands executing java classes etc which were totally new to me i really enjoyed it
6758478 dharvinder entered the competition on his own initiative we are delighted as this shows the calibre of students with technical skills in our program

6758480 we cant wait until the last minute to buy food and other essentials by that time we might not be able to purchase anything because the prices will skyrocket or supplies will be sold out
6758481 a storm surge in the gulf could cause greater damage than the one triggered by cyclone nargis in burma last may
6758482 its better for everyone to stay alert and prepare for and mitigate a disaster
6758483 theres a lot of old people that are still alive that have very in depth detailed knowledge about changing climates and also alot of people still have interpretations related to rock art which depict climate change events
6758484 although yeast can derive energy from a lot of different carbon sources such as fatty acids and different kinds of sugars yeast really really like glucose the sugar found in honey
6758485 thats what they will use if its there even if its there only in trace amounts
6758486 how do you get yeast to give up their habit of using only glucose no matter what else is around
6758487 yeast essentially care about glucose because they are genetically programmed that way not because there is any physiological reason they have to care about glucose
6758488 we can genetically change that program we are using genetics to modify yeast strains so that they will use other sugars just as well as glucose
6758489 you get a lot more ethanol for the same amount of work
6758490 a couple of years ago i did think about coming out of international retirement
6758491 i spoke to steve mcclaren a couple of times about it when he became the new coach i considered it quite strongly for a while but in the end i came to the conclusion that i had made the right decision in the first place and i didnt want to go back when steve was appointed he rang and asked me to return just the fact the england manager had rung and asked me to come back and play for my country meant a lot to me he didnt have to do that but he went out of his way to ring me and also came down to training and asked if i fancied it i did think about it but i dont really think i was ever that close that i would have said yes it wasnt about not thinking it was too much or i wasnt capable it was just the fact that when i was playing i wasnt enjoying it one little bit
6758492 i will carry on as long as i can as long as i feel i am still contributing to united i want to carry on
6758493 when i eventually stop then i will think about what i want to do from then on if i feel i can still be of worth i will carry on if not i will go i am sure the manager will say something as well if he turns round to me and says i am not doing enough anymore then fair enough that will be it it is part of life i dont worry about it you get too old and you cant do what you used to you have to accept it i am 34 in november and hope to still be playing at 35 anything after that if i am still playing well and doing something for the team then it will be a bonus

6758534 i watched the first half and then stopped watching because i felt the game was over
6758535 chelsea were very good but portsmouth had a bad day at the office that can happen to anybody before they could even get into the game it was already over for them
6758536 however chelsea were impressive but on one game you cannot assess too much
6758537 chelsea will be one of the super candidates to fight for the title but i feel we have enough to fight with them
6758538 there was not one factor why we fell away last season it was a conjunction of a few things like injuries some bad luck as well as a bit of inexperience and nervousness
6758539 we have a short squad yes and we cannot afford 10 injuries like other teams with big numbers
6758540 but i think we have the right number of players who can compete at the top level when everyone is fit
6758541 that is not the case at the moment but through the season we should get guys like abou diaby tomas rosicky and eduardo back
6758542 we know the success of our season is based on how quickly we can focus again on club targets after international games
6758543 fulham have a strong squad and their team look more dangerous going forwards than they did last year
6758544 if you add to that it will be a derby you want a game where you have complete focus
6758545 i believe that emmanuel has been unfairly treated because he had a lot of interest from many big clubs and he always told me one to one his preference was to stay in the end he stayed
6758546 that story did not come out like that in the press and unfortunately he is paying a price for a story which is not really him
6758547 he made a press conference in austria where people interpreted his statements a bit differently but i know what he told me and i know he made sacrifices to stay
6758548 i was convinced he wanted to stay but i was not always convinced he would stay because there is a big difference in that
6758549 hay i bet this cuz of how cavepeople didz it
6758550 if we just went running out of the cave as little cave babies and stuck anything in our mouths that would have been potentially very dangerous

6758555 john terry has been captain of chelsea for quite a while that must have been an advantage
6758556 the difference here is that i operate my captains on seniority
6758557 in the long term rio will be captain of manchester united there is no question about that it is a position we are very comfortable with that
6758558 his leadership qualities have improved tremendously over the last couple of years and his ability is there for all to see
6758559 i dont think anyone was actually nailed on for it
6758560 it was always a flip of the coin between rio or john terry
6758561 at rios age i dont think we need to worry about the effect of what happened
6758562 but it was the managers choice and he has chosen john terry rio just has to get on with it it is as simple as that
6758563 unselfishness is maybe not the biggest crime to have as a football
6758564 it shows qualities of teamwork and a general nature which is terrific to see in footballers
6758565 we are in an era of individual appreciation earrings tattoos goals the need to be seen
6758566 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6758567 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6758568 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6758569 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6758570 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6758571 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6758572 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6758573 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6758574 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6758575 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6758576 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6758577 if you trust every web site but not a government
6758578 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6758579 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6758580 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6758581 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6758582 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6758583 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6758584 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6758585 to get into that final is definitely a great accomplishment and i think we can get on to that podium
6758586 always exciting to be at the games and out on that track
6758587 when youre in the middle of the track youre more in the race
6758588 youve got more of a cushion both sides youre more in the mix
6758589 in the relay youve got to expect one or a couple of the favourites to drop out
6758590 so basically you just want to focus on each other and thats what we did we did ours and they did theirs and were really thinking about getting on the podium
6758591 our members are looking for the same percentage wage increase offered to other employees of the colleges
6758592 the appropriate comparator group for support staff are employees who perform similar duties in the broader public sector and ontario public sector
6758593 we believe this current management proposal is a fair offer in light of other public sector settlements which are trending at three per cent or less
6758594 what we are facing is a numbers shortage there is no way we will be able to survive at our current level if it continues like this
6758595 it will be impossible to have any improvement this season if we do not improve the numbers greatly
6758596 we cannot sustain what we did last season finishing fifth and having a good european run we could not really sustain it when we were short of players from january onwards last season
6758597 now we are more players short than then so if we are in a worse position there is no way we can achieve again what we did last season we are trying to make it better and working hard on the current situation
6758598 this is probably the toughest period i have had as everton manager mainly because a lot of my concentration at the moment is not with the players i have here and they are the most important but with trying to bring new players in
6758599 there is no doubt that a lot of our energy is being spent on players we want to sign and that is not helpful for the team
6758600 we have come close to making signings but i believe it shows how much you need big money in this division to attract players
6758601 you need to do it at the right time and the shutters in the shop are halfway down at the moment with just a week to go
6758602 the business has changed there are a lot of people these days with their finger in the pie it makes things difficult but that is there way things are going these days
6758603 i am still looking for seven or eight new players at the moment
6758604 we want to play much better than last week that was just not good enough blackburn were better than us i cannot argue about that i am now looking for a better performance
6758605 cahill is at least a month away he has been missed an important member of the team
6758606 but we did not have him for long spells last season and still finished fifth so this is not a one man band here but we need him desperately because of the lack of numbers in the squad as much as anything else
6758607 it is difficult to manage with such small numbers but we had that problem last season towards the end
6758608 the positive side is that we have brought in a lot of young players and they have been terrific they have grabbed the opportunity and i am very pleased with them
6758609 in terms of adding to the squad there is nothing even close we have no one coming in who can help us at west brom so we have to concentrate on what we have
6758610 we have given some kids their chance they are learning and i am learning about them all the time but you get given a group of players and your job as a coach is to make them win i couldnt make that happen last week but we will continue working
6758611 i was not that surprised by what happened last week if people thought it was going to be all singing and dancing with the size of squad we have then they are mistaken
6758612 west brom will be difficult i admire what tony mowbray has done there but i am not surprised his hibs teams always played good football and that is now how albion play
6758613 the operations of the federal government will be most extensive and important in times of war and danger those of the state governments in times of peace and security

6758649 in the aftermath of the recent outbreaks fda wanted to fast track an important tool to help industry improve the safety of fresh produce
6758650 significant deaths and injuries and the destruction of many homes and schools
6758651 sincere sympathies to the affected particularly the many families with young children whose lives have been profoundly disrupted
6758652 my thoughts are with those who have been displaced by fighting people whose lives have been lost and disrupted
6758653 working together we can help mindanao move toward peace and prosperity so the citizens of mindanao especially the children may have the future they deserve

6758661 barack obamas failure to accurately report his campaigns financial records is an incredibly suspicious situation that appears to be an attempt to hide his campaigns interaction with a left wing organization previously convicted of voter fraud for a candidate who claims to be practicing new politics his fec reports look an awful lot like the old style chicago politics of yesterday
6758662 the rnc can concoct all of the outlandish conspiracy theories they want but when we saw that our fec report didnt accurately reflect the field work csi was hired to perform we corrected it its pretty bold for the rnc to attack us for a clerical error after john mccains campaign was just forced to return 50 000 raised by a foreign national through a number of contributors who werent even supporting mccain
6758663 its rare that people dont file any amended reports if he has a pattern of lots and lots of amended reports that would be more noteworthy than an occasional one
6758664 all of this just seems like an awful lot of money and time spent on political campaigning for an organization that purports to exist to help low income consumers
6758665 acorn has a long and sordid history of employing convoluted enron style accounting to illegally use taxpayer funds for their own political gain
6758666 now it looks like acorn is using the same type of convoluted accounting scheme for obamas political gain
6758667 that was a very short term contract for one week of work in ohio they asked us to do canvasses in five cities statewide

6758669 the people on the bus tell lies lies lies all through the state
6758670 we feel that the secret ballot is absolutely necessary in order to ensure that workers are not intimidated into voting for a union they might not otherwise choose
6758671 intimidated into voting for a union they might not otherwise choose
6758672 so i decided to start a network where people from across the world might come together and get a conversation started over me where it will lead i dont know but the world would be a better place if everyone talked a little more to each other
6758673 people sign cards to just get the union organizer off their back
6758674 we think workers are smart enough to figure out on their own if they want to belong to a union
6758675 during an election campaign there is a considerable amount of pressure on workers
6758676 the problem with the bill is that it puts another point of pressure on the worker the pressure to sign the card thats just increasing the pressure on the worker
6758677 the employers i talk to say that if workers want to organize thats fine we just want them to do it by secret ballot we dont want them harassed or intimidated by the union organizers

6758681 peace initiatives and tibetan cultural preservation projects important to the dalai lama
6758682 we focused on raising awareness of the great firewall of china the state sponsored information filtering apparatus that monitors and controls emails and websites within china
6758683 the great firewall is a tool used by the chinese government to stifle grass roots dissent and prevent the freedoms of speech and press us corporations play a roll in aiding and abetting the implementation of the great firewall of china though the issue is complex it requires substantially more public discussion on how u s information technology is being used to deny 1 3 billion people fundamental rights
6758684 through music each person in the audience can expand their definition of who they are as members of this city and go beyond the familiar exploring the potential of intercultural and interfaith collaboration
6758685 our goal is for the events to invite seemingly unconventional partnerships between professional artists and community performers and between traditional and experimental artists to encourage community building that transcends borders
6758686 we are continually trying to build performances that encourage collaboration between artists who normally work independently we seek to highlight artists from around the world as well as provide meaningful contexts for local artists who work tirelessly in our own city
6758687 i can now announce that tom and i are expecting a baby and we are very happy
6758688 he watched only her performance then walked backstage to the meet and greet area
6758689 but when he saw people start to recognize him he hid it was real obvious he didnt want people to know he was there to see taylor
6758690 they are friends and shes friends with all the jonas brothers
6758691 this case has an added element of humiliation with the young victim being left without his trousers and having to put on somebody elses filthy old ones
6758692 you say you have changed and stopped drinking and sorted yourself out i am not convinced about that but i am going to give you time to convince me

6758699 we have not found anything hazardous in the initial testing in the initial examination we did
6758700 we have no reports of anybody being sick we have 12 people quarantined here on scene who were exposed three of those law enforcement two firefighters and seven civilians none of them are showing any symptoms nobodys reporting any sickness
6758701 in any situation like this when its a little out of the norm unusual something that could create a hazard we really want to jump on it right away and make sure were protecting the folks coming into see us but the patients and health care workers that we currently have in the hospital
6758702 our haz mat team did not said that they did not see any powder the letter certainly had some threatening language so they had reason to fear but we did not find the initial report was white powder they did not find any large quantities it was described to me as they found maybe a couple granules of something it tested positive for protein
6758703 any time you send a threatening letter and there was threatening language in the letter thats a crime so law enforcement wants to take this very seriously
6758704 muitos alegaram que s tomaram conhecimento do censo recentemente quando receberam em casa o comunicado do recadastramento entendemos que o mais certo a fazer era ampliar o prazo

6758706 la resoluci n tal como est ahora no contar con el apoyo de mi gobierno y para nosotros sigue siendo importante que se reafirme la integridad territorial de georgia
6758707 nadie puede considerar que se encuentre cerca de la zona de conflicto
6758708 los seis puntos sin clarificaciones nos hacen temer que se ponga al consejo en la posici n de respaldar algo que no se respeta

6758718 one of the key reasons for the success of the chevrolet cobalt and pontiac g5 is the lordstown workforce and the strong partnerships with the uaw and local and state officials
6758719 based on the quality of work and these strong partnerships we are pleased to announce our plans to invest another 500 million in the chevy cruze product program in the u s including more than 350 million in lordstown
6758720 the cruze will build on the already successful chevrolet cobalt cobalt xfe and cobalt ss all of which are nearly sold out in dealer showrooms
6758721 our dealers are asking for many more cobalts than we can build
6758722 the chevrolet cruze was designed and engineered by our global teams in europe and asia pacific and will be manufactured in those regions in addition to the assembly plant here in lordstown ohio
6758723 our goal for the chevrolet cruze is to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment

6758727 we feel that we are more than just a technology partner we provide a one stop total visual solution from simple led display installation to the most sophisticated led application ensuring that the intended solution is delivered to the audience effectively and with visual impact
6758728 as other rental partners have found making an investment in a high end brand of led screen brings significant benefits
6758729 we are proud that jm rental has chosen to invest in lighthouse and we look forward to supporting them in their continued growth
6758730 they basically had a t thrust on their last set and this year they wanted one that would extend even further out into the audience

6758733 the lights connect the walkways to the stage and the stage to the risers the lights are programmed so that they all flow together theyre so impressive that you dont necessarily see them as a light on its own but as part of the entire visual product i think they even exceeded our expectations as to what they were going to look like
6758734 its the nature of touring that things get thrown in the back of a truck you just cant think of a more destructive way of handling product and the lights have held up very well
6758735 we really think that we have provided a durable functional world class set at a reasonable price and this is proof that you dont have to pay the big bucks to get a product that is both beautiful and custom

6758743 the industry will have to look seriously at how it can maintain its productivity if numbers fall significantly
6758744 the issue is that food and drink companies turn to migrant labour because they cannot find staff in the numbers they need at home
6758745 ministers need to be fully aware of the contribution migrant workers make to the food and drink industry when it comes to developing policies on immigration
6758746 the fdf believes that collaboration between the council and industry leaders is required to improve the image of the food and drink industry as an attractive place for unskilled and semi skilled british people to work in

6758854 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6758855 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6758856 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6758857 the balance were trying to reach is between iraqs stated desire to have a more concrete view of us forces levels out through the years and our desire it be based on conditions on the ground
6758858 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation

6758872 apartenenta teritoriala a insulei serpilor nu face obiectul acestui proces
6758873 ucraina si romania au convenit de comun acord in acordul conex la tratatul politic de baza din 1997 ca cij este competenta numai pentru trasarea acestei linii de delimitare zona de peste 12 000 km patrati din marea neagra aflata in disputa nu se afla in jurisdictia ucrainei este o zona unde ambele state au pretentii concurente la platou continental si zona economica exclusiva acest diferend urmand sa fie solutionat de cij

6758882 early weaning is a cost control strategy that beef producers might consider
6758883 economic damage is almost certain when decision making is delayed
6758884 the decision to wean early for example is most often made when the cow is perilously thin and feed costs are out of control
6758885 all aspects of the nutritional management of early weaned cattle should be geared toward encouraging dry matter intake
6758886 overcoming the reluctance to eat is arguably the most important aspect of weaning management
6758887 early weaned calves are small compared to calves weaned at conventional age
6758888 once a few calves encounter and use bunks and waterers those behaviors will transfer quickly from one individual to another within the pen
6758889 but the real advantage of early weaning is linked to the performance of the cow
6758890 es ist sehr schwierig die motivation aufrecht zu erhalten besonders f r einen fahrer wie dani der es gewohnt ist um den sieg zu k mpfen und der wei dass er das potenzial dazu hat
6758891 f r honda ist es das gleiche an eine strecke zu kommen und eine sekunde pro runde hinterher zu hinken und um platz elf zu k mpfen ist f r einen fahrer sehr schwierig
6758892 um schnell und am maximum zu fahren ist nicht einfach man muss sehr konzentriert sein und es ist auf jeden fall unm glich die selbe konzentration zu haben wenn es nur im platz acht geht
6758893 ich bin vorn und habe einen guten vorsprung aber wir haben in br nn beim testen gesehen dass stoner gut in form ist er hat hart attackiert und er ist sehr schnell ich wei dass es ab jetzt verdammt hart sein wird insofern m ssen wir so hart wie es geht arbeiten um das bike zu verbessern es ist eine wichtige f hrung aber wir haben einen starken rivalen und es ist noch ein langer weg
6758894 es ist sehr beeindruckend casey und ducati zu schlagen wenn sie auf dem h hepunkt ihres performance potenzials stehen valentino musste all seine energie und erfahrung in die waagschale werfen aber ebenso beeindruckend war seine fahrt und der absolute siegeswille um vorne zu bleiben
6758895 die botschaft an die jungen fahrer lautet daher dass selbst wenn wir im training um eine ganze sekunde hinterher hinken valentinos siegeshunger noch gr er wurde jeder andere h tte da aufgegeben wenn man es bedenkt war es nahezu verr ckt an einen sieg in laguna zu denken aber sein kampfgeist ist unersch tterlich
6758896 es war sehr wichtig weil es valentino und dem team viel glauben an sich selbst verschafft hat
6758897 was so besonders war war die tatsache dass er nie aufgab obwohl er im training so weit hinten lag genau das gleiche war in br nn der fall die drei rennen vor laguna war casey unglaublich und es sah so aus als w re er kaum zu schlagen laguna hat gezeigt dass wir ihn schlagen k nnen und in br nn haben wir angefangen zu glauben dies ein weiteres mal schaffen zu k nnen
6758898 casey ist eine unglaubliche erste runde gefahren aber dann haben wir unsere pace gefunden und das war ein gutes zeichen wir konnten einigen druck auf casey aus ben und zum ersten mal konnte er sich nach einer guten ersten runde nicht von uns absetzen

6759028 for us to turn back now on what we want to go do it will mean we dont trust ourselves

6759031 i must make it clear we want to play a total rugby expansive game we want to throw the ball around we want to use all of our players so that they can enjoy the game and so that the spectators can enjoy the game
6759032 if you look at our starter moves and the way we manage to break the line its all coming into place but after that the decision making from there is one thing that the players are not used to
6759033 in nature there are neither rewards nor punishments there are consequences
6759034 once we realize that imperfect understanding is the human condition there is no shame in being wrong only in failing to correct our mistakes

6759055 according to crist the key to getting the deal started was a federal lawsuit filed by earthjustice and the florida wildlife federation challenging the practice of backpumping farm runoff containing phosphorous pesticides and other chemicals into the lake
6759056 the suit contended that backpumping triggered massive algae blooms and compromised drinking water quality for small towns such as pahokee and south bay that draw their supply from the lake
6759057 in december 2006 u s district judge cecilia altonaga ruled that backpumping violates the clean water act then in august 2007 the south florida water management district the defendant in the case voted 4 3 to end the practice the four votes came from crist appointees
6759058 sugar executives viewed the decision as devastating so they assigned the lobbyists to ask crist where the industry stood

6759080 israel will continue with the talks and the fifth round of negotiations is scheduled to begin soon
6759081 assad looked to purchase arms from russia even before his current trip to moscow we strongly oppose such a move and
6759082 foreign minister salah bashir summoned the israeli ambassador this week to officially inform him that jordan rejects such illegal measures
6759083 israel plans excavations near mughrabi gate of the mosque and wants to build a bridge there violating the 1994 peace treaty with jordan and international treaties
6759084 this would also lead to a new violent conflict in the middle east because jerusalem is a red line for muslims and arabs
6759085 the foreign minister demanded that israel halt any unilateral actions that might affect the status of jerusalem especially the issue of al mughrabi gate
6759086 we have information that jerusalem municipality will take a decision soon to resume work there
6759087 because they confirm the bible that we have theres variants but basically its that you can barely tell the difference between the two texts the one that we have in qumran and in our bibles
6759088 its also important because we can hold the same scrolls in our hands that they held in their hands 2 000 years ago and when somebody sits there with their new testament and their bibles in the united states and theyre listening to their favorite sermon they can know that this bible was based upon manuscripts that people held in their hands from 2 000 years ago
6759089 we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of the state of israel and by chance or not also the 60th anniversary of the discovery of the dead sea scrolls we thought that the best way to honor the state of israel is to bring back these major treasures of the jewish nation for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the country
6759090 i think a strong case could be made for anyone of faith that this is a tremendous act of god to make this available to people at the same time that the state of israel as a people has actually been restored and im not sure and we dont want to overstate the rather amazing timing
6759091 its hard to overstate the amazing coincidence that the massive scrolls were discovered around the same time in the same months that the state of israel was proclaimed and was founded here in the land again
6759092 but also i have to remind you of the fact that its the oft quoted prophet in the new testament and all the major prophecies concerning the messiah which in the christian interpretation was jesus theyre also theyre coming from the book of isaiah
6759093 and there is a specific event and we have only one instance in all the gospels where we actually have jesus reading from a scroll as it is in the gospel luke chapter 4 that on shabbat sabbath on saturday in nazareth he was given the book of isaiah and he read from the book the famous passage in isaiah chapter 61
6759094 it means that for jesus for john the baptist and for the first christians all of them also jews the book of isaiah was very central for them
6759095 the spirit of the lord is on me because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor he has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind to release the oppressed to proclaim the year of the lords favor
6759096 brands will only succeed with these widgetads if they create content that puts community first lean on new interactions integrate with other tools plan for the long haul and change how they measure success traditional internet advertising tactics wont apply
6759097 its not for the faint of heart but its exactly what were telling our clients you need to embrace in the social web
6759098 theyre going to make these comments somewhere so why not just encourage them to build these conversations around your ad
6759099 we dont offer it on single shots of spirits its only say if you order a single shot of vodka and pepsi then you will get three of them
6759100 this is exactly the kind of irresponsible alcohol promotion that encourages people to drink more than they would normally
6759101 it shows that voluntary regulation by the industry is not working and that the government needs to take more stringent action to prevent bars and pubs from offering this kind of promotion
6759102 you can buy two cases of stella artois from the supermarkets for 20 and the pubs have reacted
6759103 we have done everything we can to warn the authorities of that we as an industry need to realise that supermarkets are our biggest competitor the government has done nothing about supermarkets and they are beating the hell out of us
6759104 the point about a nightclub is that if you are half full youre less than half full the next week no one likes an empty nightclub they need density of customers we are just testing the market we could have done this across the estate

6759109 imagine leading your family in daily worship in the home reading the scriptures singing and praying but simultaneously introducing them to the history leading figures and theology of the great sixteenth century reformation all this in a fresh and interesting way in just about a quarter of an hour each day that would be great you say but it would take me hours and days to put that together i could never do it well ray rhodes has done it for you in family worship for the reformation season use this book with joy it will inspire inform and instruct you and your family the studies are simple but meaty the scriptures passages are helpfully chosen and most of the lessons can be completed in fifteen minutes employ and be edified
6759110 many today have called our increasingly secular age the beginning of a new dark ages others see our climate as a time similar to that which birthed the reformation a time when the light of gods word broke through the abiding spiritual darkness becoming one characterized by the production and proliferation of the scriptures thus the latter was a movement from a visual based society to a word based society toward this end ray rhodes provides us with a much needed tool for our families to return to gods word understand our heritage and be equipped to perpetuate this faith to the generations to come you have all you need in this book to teach your family how to celebrate the reformation season
6759111 once common the practice of family worship has all but disappeared among the people of god today recent years however have seen a revival of interest in and commitment to this biblical responsibility and privilege ray rhodes has contributed to the recovery of this resurgence with practical books like this one informative and useful at any time of year this book would be particularly timely in the weeks leading up to reformation day
6759112 this book combines two divine blessings that are being rediscovered by a growing number of christians in our day our reformation heritage and family worship ray rhodes has performed a great service to families by organizing useful information about the former in ways that can be easily used in the latter i pray that this book will be used to teach the rising generation important biblical truths through the stories of faithful men and women on whose shoulders we stand
6759113 from the pen of author pastor conference speaker and book dealer ray rhodes comes yet another gem a month of studies for the reformation season geared for family worship if you long to know more about this pivotal time in church history yet you have felt intimidated by the subject matter then get this book you will learn your family will learn and you just might have a lot of fun as well
6759114 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6759115 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6759116 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6759117 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this

6759126 this resolution should be tabled before parliament on monday on wednesday it should be passed and the judges restored
6759127 although there is a small minority of parents who object to the vaccine because of their beliefs about sexuality and the fact that it prevents a sexually transmitted infection to most parents the mode of transmission is not whats important
6759128 the families who are struggling with what to do about this vaccine are focused on issues like safety
6759129 they want us to have more experience with it and have it used by more people
6759130 we tend to overrate the power of conservative forces in our society on the everyday lives of people for example roman catholics use contraception and have abortions at about the same rates as other women in this country
6759131 the most common form plaque psoriasis appears as raised red patches or lesions covered with a silvery white buildup of dead skin cells called scale
6759132 it seems that psoriasis is most common in caucasians and slightly less common in african americans worldwide psoriasis is most common in scandinavia and other parts of northern europe it appears to be far less common among asians and is rare in native americans
6759133 no special blood tests or diagnostic tools exist to diagnose psoriasis the physician or other health care provider usually examines the affected skin and decides if it is from psoriasis less often the physician examines a piece of skin biopsy under the microscope
6759134 escrts are like the recycling units of the cell they oversee the constant intake break down and replenishing of junctions on the cell surface
6759135 in a cancer cell where escrts are damaged the junctions may not be restored properly this can cause cells to separate and migrate to form secondary tumours in other parts of the body
6759136 previous studies have shown a link between escrts and the loss of junctions in cells of fruit flies so we want to see whether this is also true in humans
6759137 this work should tell us more about the role of escrts in cancer and provide possible new targets for therapy in the future
6759138 what was more important to him was tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires
6759139 sen coleman has demonstrated that you can significantly raise benefits without raising taxes as he did with over 30 votes that have increased veterans funding by nearly 70 during his time in office
6759140 should be rooted in preserving and strengthening the important patient doctor relationship
6759141 making health insurance more affordable not increasing the governments role
6759142 we can turn health care in steps over to government control and learn to live with mediocrity or we can work in a bipartisan fashion to extend benefits of individually owned health insurance to those uninsured
6759143 i believe the latter approach will provide greater access and better quality health care
6759144 families in this state are facing a health care crisis because washington isnt looking out for them
6759145 unite around the goal of accessible affordable health care for every texas family
6759146 texans deserve a health care system that works for them not for big insurance and the washington lobbyists
6759147 texans deserve real health care security for their families lowered costs for employers and more transparency and accountability than our current system provides
6759148 along with all the things that parents know are important for helping keep their kids healthy like washing hands and getting enough sleep flu vaccination should be right up there but this survey shows us that we still have a lot of educating to do
6759149 as a community we need to do a better job spreading the word about how important a yearly flu vaccine can be in helping protect kids and ourselves from influenza
6759150 its got to be through relationships handing out religious tracts would not go over well at all that would be like me walking around with a free tibet flag
6759151 if foreigners do such things in china they violate the law and local religious departments and other departments should stop them
6759152 they looked for opportunities to talk to the locals and share about their faith
6759153 our goal was wanting to communicate the love of god to people not be overt
6759154 it was almost like they were treating us like criminals
6759155 we thought wed stay away from beijing we honestly didnt come here to cause trouble
6759156 when you assign a chaplain its almost like saying were bringing a team to china and assigning the coach well the coach doesnt know the players and only knows the sport we feel the spiritual realm is the same way

6759162 morrison had been adamant against doing commercials and densmore wanted to honor morrisons memory
6759163 he should recognize there is a strong pro life trend prevailing all across america its been ten years in the making and so many democrats are starting to emulate or pretend to emulate a pro life position so that they can take advantage of that trend
6759164 so it would be a huge mistake for john mccain to be anything other than what he is which is authentically pro life
6759165 if you see the deaths of 40 million children since roe v wade as a reality that you cannot tolerate it makes no sense to balance a ticket with someone who would do nothing to save them
6759166 hold all aals events at another hotel to ensure the maximum participation by our members
6759167 as an attorney and a law school dean im absolutely shocked by the american association of law schools
6759168 it shows that they have a liberal ideology and they dont respect the rule of law they certainly dont respect other peoples viewpoints
6759169 that is not what law is about what we see happening in this area is exactly what we have said about in the past thats happening in law
6759170 people are using law separate from transcendent principles and morality using it simply as a coercive force to get across their liberal ideology and their agenda
6759171 w e at liberty university school of law are intent on training a new generation of lawyers and judges policymakers and world leaders in the rule of law from a christian perspective
6759172 certainly the time has come to train a new generation not the way these secularists want to train them but to train them in a proper foundation of the rule of law
6759173 terrible and destructive ends that have nothing to do with law or justice
6759174 he thought it was a movie and asked where his father was and when the movie would end
6759175 when terrorism becomes really extensive in an area we generally no longer call it terrorism but rather war or insurgency
6759176 largely the product of sectarian violence rampant criminal activity and home grown insurgency and therefore grossly distort the global terrorism picture
6759177 it makes no sense to count civilian casualties in a war zone as deaths caused by terrorism mr zakaria wrote since the mid 1990s thousands of civilians have been killed in war zones in other countries around the world and those victims werent counted as casualties related to terrorism
6759178 obviously the war didnt fuel extremist views in muslim countries
6759179 i have talked to laluji he told what he had to say now i will talk to remaining upa leaders
6759180 we dont like this our order must be complied with we have said that in our order first let it be executed
6759181 despite the stock market being volatile government employees are willing to take the risk they are now focusing on investing in stock markets rather than in traditional instruments like post offices banks and ppf
6759182 due to this inconsistency export by units under sezs would not qualify for income tax exemption under section 10aa of the income tax this anomaly needs to be corrected and there needs to be harmonisation in the two acts to help sez units avail the tax exemption
6759183 weve seen deal activity in india hold steady for three consecutive quarters but this most recent quarter posted the second highest investment total on record due in large part to the 70 million second round for laqshya media of mumbai the second largest deal ever completed in india
6759184 while the size of venture deals in the us europe and even china continues to climb venture capitalists have shown some restraint in terms of investments in india due largely to the risk still associated with this emerging region in fact since we began tracking venture investment in india the median deal size has dropped from 17 million in 2005 to 10 million in 2006 and now to 8 million in the first six months of 2008
6759185 the national capital region ncr including delhi gurgaon and noida is expected to witness flattening trend in rentals over the short to medium term
6759186 however some micro markets with forthcoming supply is likely to experience a marginal value correction in the next six months
6759187 time for a change we are the people we can do it
6759188 this is the first election where ive actually paid attention to every single thing and i think its because im a mom now
6759189 i just think barack is amazing i admire him i admire michelle
6759190 i think hes inspirational and thats what this country needs right now
6759191 we studied the properties of disease causing viruses that evolved to infect mucosal surfaces to engineer a coating that enables our drug delivery particles to penetrate mucus layers in minutes in our new work we have improved the coatings considerably to allow faster penetration for a wider array of particle sizes
6759192 for example we constantly inhale particles into our lungs but they typically stick to mucus rather than penetrate it particles that stick are removed rapidly from the lungs on a mucus conveyor belt and are swallowed and sterilized in the gut mucus barriers protect us from constant infection as well as everyday things like the millions of particles in the black cloud emitted from a bus when it takes off from a stop
6759193 if a particle is small enough and not adhesive then it can get through the mucus net thats how some viruses penetrate mucus barriers
6759194 peg is one of the most widely used polymers for therapeutic applications
6759195 for example cervical cancer patients could locally apply chemo drugs inside mucus penetrating particles which would then deliver the drug locally in the female reproductive tract at efficient concentrations over prolonged periods of time instead of delivering it everywhere else in the body that could drastically reduce the side effects as well as prolong the presence of drugs at the target site
6759196 eventually we seek to engineer systems where a drug could be delivered to a specific tissue or set of cells anywhere in the body we want to make that possible
6759197 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6759198 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6759199 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6759200 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation
6759201 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6759202 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6759203 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6759204 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6759205 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6759206 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6759207 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6759208 if you trust every web site but not a government
6759209 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6759210 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6759211 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6759212 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6759213 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6759214 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6759215 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6759216 we are very encouraged by the vidaza data from the aza 001 trial this trial showed for the first time a drug can extend survival for mds patients
6759217 we are excited to see that in this trial vidaza also reduced the need for blood transfusions
6759218 it is like compacting your entire wardrobe into a shoebox
6759219 what takes care of neutralizing dna to allow chromosomes to condense
6759220 did dinoflagellates once have histones and then lost them or did dinoflagellates never have histones and just figured out a different way to fold large amounts of dna into chromosomes
6759221 chromosomes would fall apart when calcium and magnesium were removed
6759222 cations play a very important role in the folding and charge neutralization of dna in all eukaryotes but more so in dinoflagellates
6759223 i find it truly amazing that in all other eukaryotes histones help in this charge neutralization and dinoflagellates constitute the only exception to this nearly universal rule it looks like this may have been the first and very efficient step toward the goal of neutralizing dna long before histones came into play
6759224 there is now incontrovertible evidence that marketing of tobacco and the depiction of smoking in the movies promote youth smoking and can cause young people to begin smoking
6759225 the role of the media in promoting and reducing tobacco use
6759226 the role of marketing in the success of the tobacco companies is conclusive
6759227 the reports recommendations offer the best approach to employ marketing techniques and the media to help prevent a further increase in youth smoking
6759228 this direct link between marketing and tobacco use is very powerful
6759229 anti tobacco ads before films and a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising are two effective strategies found to curb effects of tobacco images on youth now we need to use marketing to steer youth and others away from tobacco
6759230 high energy prices have led to an increase in biodiesel production which in turn has led to an increase in the amount of crude glycerol in the market
6759231 we have shown that it is possible to use the crude glycerol byproduct from the biodiesel industry as a carbon source for microalgae that produce omega 3 fatty acids
6759232 after thorough chemical analysis we have also shown that the algae biomass composition has the same quality as the commercial algae product
6759233 the fish fed the algae had significant amounts of omega 3 fatty acids
6759234 production of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid from biodiesel waste glycerol by microalgal fermentation agfd 272
6759235 in china human rabies was largely under control during the years 1990 1996 via nation wide rabies vaccination programmes since the end of the century however cases of human rabies have jumped high enough to trigger a warning sign for control and prevention
6759236 the use of human and equine rabies immunoglobulins hrig erig has saved the lives of countless patients who would have died if treated with vaccine alone however both products are often in short supply worldwide and are virtually unaffordable in developing countries
6759237 the four rabies endemic provinces lacked strictly enforced measures to eliminate dog rabies or an ample supply of modern cell culture rabies vaccines for humans
6759238 in the worst affected province guandong 62 5 of patients did not receive proper treatment on their wounds 92 5 did not receive adequate post exposure vaccination and 91 25 did not receive any anti rabies immunoglobulin
6759239 social realities of being a woman in a poverty stricken and unequal society
6759240 plight of an hiv positive woman goes beyond already troubling issues of medication access and proper health care
6759241 advocate for their own issues be it rights issues economic empowerment issues or sexual reproductive health issues
6759242 through support groups that they organize meetings that they attend with ministry officials and training workshops that they attend its all in an effort to ultimately make them feel empowered where at many times in their life they may feel powerless
6759243 these rat model tumors were developed from human glioblastoma tumor cells and closely mimic human tumors in growth patterns and response to therapy
6759244 the concept of targeting blood vessels that feed tumors as an approach to limit tumor growth is not a novel idea
6759245 however blocking the specific fatty acid described in this study is novel and holds great promise for use in humans
6759246 if survival time could be extended with a combination of surgical therapy and infusion with similar drugs this could be a significant treatment option

6759259 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother

6759339 in light of the conclusions in the report and the history of advocacy in this province its not clear that that should be one of the priorities
6759340 crime victims are often the forgotten individuals of the criminal justice system and are sometimes treated with less attention respect and sensitivity than they deserve
6759341 the rights of the victims of crime have never been a priority for premier dalton mcguintys government
6759342 the only time when they took any action to do anything for them was when they were dragged kicking and screaming into doing it by the ombudsmans report
6759343 the office of a victim advocate as an officer of the legislative assembly would address all of the concerns that victims have had and permit the legislature to receive non partisan guidance on a regular basis of where the gaps are in the system
6759344 we are as mr mcmurtry says a leader and a model for other jurisdictions

6759365 oil went up the u s dollar went down and the canadian dollar went along for a very nice ride
6759366 i wouldnt necessarily have expected a rally in bond yields based on the events of today which seems to be general financial market pessimism and somewhat soft inflation numbers beneath the surface
6759367 i am a little surprised that we are getting a selloff but the fact that the u s sold off is probably contributing to the canadian price action
6759368 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6759369 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6759370 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6759371 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6759372 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6759373 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6759374 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6759375 people probably didnt think i would get far because of where im from being able to do what ive always wanted to do my entire life is a gift and my whole dream has come true to see where i am from where i was is just crazy
6759376 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6759377 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6759378 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6759379 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6759380 its great that we have wireless email and wireless internet and stuff like that but at the end of the day it would be nice to have wireless recharge as well
6759381 i didnt have a smoking gun that i could fix
6759382 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
6759383 we are aware of the log on problems but we have no comment at the moment
6759384 it seems like suspending itunes is punishment for itunes but really it doesnt hurt itunes it hurts us
6759385 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the chinese government
6759386 when he would do my makeup i always wondered why he wasnt the one being photographed he had the best taste in the world he was versatile sweet funny a wonderful man and a truly great friend
6759387 he was a beautiful spirit passionate brilliant so creative and loving the heart of a spiritual being i will miss him every day
6759388 what interesting or out of the ordinary things have you ever done to get connected to the internet and or company network when working remotely
6759389 had to climb on my mothers roof once it was so fun i actually saw a naked neighbor girl
6759390 drove 15 miles away from old faithful geyser to achieve a complete internet connection due to static from geyser emissions energy
6759391 driven to the local coffee shop and purchased a muffin to use their wireless
6759392 had to hack into a phone line at a hotel to get dial up to work many years ago
6759393 i have plugged my laptop into a hospital ethernet line because the wireless was down
6759394 i have researched hotels that do not provide internet but are nearby wireless hubs to get connection freely
6759395 i went up to the top of a mountain and worked for a week from a tent
6759396 logged into hotel conference rooms to get the connection for free
6759397 paid for a cab ride while i worked on the internet
6759398 plugged into electricity from the city of seattle that was on a pole on the sidewalk but only for a few minutes
6759399 held my laptop out a window to get the wi fi next door so i could send an important email
6759400 sat outside an airport for 4 hours so i could use the free wireless across the street
6759401 ive done a lot of crazy things but ill never be able to admit it or id lose my dignity
6759402 moved throughout my home because of connection problems i found myself sitting in a ducky chair in my toddlers room because that is where i got the best connection
6759403 i think a laundromat is the strangest one i ever hooked up to
6759404 when im out there i would hope that our teams a lot more confident that we can make big plays and when its nut cutting time they know the balls coming to me and i can make a play for us
6759405 hes always one of the top receivers in the league possibly the best receiver in the league
6759406 but he doesnt start out with the ball in his hands so its up to us to make sure he doesnt see the ball too often
6759407 it should be a very intense game and hopefully not too high scoring
6759408 hes one of those big play guys that you need to have on your team
6759409 hes the mvp of the league hes the best player on our team and just having him on the field just brings more attention to him and gets receivers jason clermont myself and clarence coleman more time to do things with the ball
6759410 its going to take the pressure off me and the double teams i feel that geroy and myself are the best two short side wide receivers together on the field so having him out is just going to make my job a lot easier and hopefully i can make his job easier
6759411 just knowing that hes going to be out there on the field you know hes going to draw a lot of attention defensively so whether or not hes getting the ball or other receivers it just opens up things more for your team
6759412 its just being a manager of the game taking care of the ball making good decisions eating popcorn and watching guys like ken yon rambo the top receiver in the west make plays on the other side
6759413 they pin their ears back early on and they try to get after the quarterback make big plays and cause turnovers
6759414 we were physical and we were able to chop down some of those guys up front were a physical team that plays hard
6759415 they bring this mindset that they think theyre tougher than us so we have to bring that mindset too
6759416 guys were picking themselves up off the ground left and right and if you dont have a bad taste in your mouth from that game you shouldnt be playing football
6759417 did you know the priya departmental store owner has had a baby girl

6759423 i like obama i really do but hes the wrong candidate too inexperienced too elitist too unattractive to working class whites
6759424 it all depends on what the meaning of is is
6759425 i grant that the clintons are ambitious but theyre good democrats and in such an important matter theyll put party loyalty above personal ambition surely they wont want to cause their party which has been very good to them over the years to lose a presidential election
6759426 see we told you so obamas a great guy in many ways but he was definitely the wrong candidate for president hillary would have won

6759442 large companies are putting together server farms of tens of thousands of computers even approaching 100 thousand and the big challenge is to interconnect all these computers so that they can talk to each other as quickly as possible without incurring significant costs
6759443 we are proposing a new topology for ethernet data center connectivity
6759444 our work addresses the problem of data center network connectivity in a world where consolidation is increasingly taking place in data centers
6759445 the history of computing and technology has an innumerable set of examples where commodity parts take over the functionality of more specialized pieces of equipment
6759446 but that commoditization hasnt taken place on the communications side so we do have these specialized components still living in the network infrastructure that incur significant costs and complexity
6759447 the other issue is that people are treating the data center as a mini internet
6759448 thats fine but they are then forced to use the same components they might use in the wide area network with a bunch of concerns that dont come up in the data center environment adversarial environments attacks parties that might not trust each other etc so you have a lot of functionalities in these specialized switching components that you really dont need in your data center and you wind up paying for it in dollars and in complexity
6759449 independent of whether our technique is successful or someone elses is five years from now switching and communication infrastructure in the datacenter will be based on these small commodity building blocks
6759450 one of the big benefits of our approach is that it scales trivially to 10 gige at the edge whereas competing techniques rely on aggregation to ever faster links to achieve higher speeds
6759451 if you were to go to 10 gige at the edge for servers today you would need to aggregate to 40 gige or 100 gigelinks moving up the tree topology unfortunately the 40gbps ethernet standard isnt even out yet and when it does become available it will be very expensive because were using identical network elements in our topology today 48 port 10 gige ethernet switches are becoming relatively inexpensive so we would scale trivially to that environment as well
6759452 from a cost perspective to build out a 25 000 node cluster today using current techniques with 100 percent bandwidth just the switching equipment would cost somewhere in the order of 28 million whereas with our technique using the identical network elements would deliver the same performance but incur costs of maybe 4 million thats a factor of seven difference
6759453 somebody on that set messed up because its not an intrinsic field generator its an intrinsic field subtractor and there would just be one of them
6759454 who are we going to ask that could talk to them about science but would know the comic material and know the grounding of it the respect for it
6759455 we dont know it might be actually in the special features

6759466 these findings indicate that we can use this functional biomarker with confidence to determine stable warfarin doses for patients which should lower the risks of adverse drug effects across ethnic populations
6759467 african americans are known to need a higher dose of warfarin and asians and caucasians need lower doses
6759468 now we have a basis for understanding why this is the case

6759478 our ongoing research relationship with chevron is a model for a productive and mutually beneficial academic corporate collaboration
6759479 i am delighted that this relationship will now broaden and deepen with the expanded university partnership program we are pleased that chevron elected to augment this elite partnership and include the viterbi school among a few select engineering schools worldwide
6759480 the viterbi school is recognized for leadership and innovation in many areas but has earned particular distinction for its work in smart oilfield technologies
6759481 both dr bentley and dr murphy are exemplary role models mentors and clinicians who have made significant contributions to advance the schools quality academic programs and student learning outcomes
6759482 their authentic approach to teaching excellence is embodied in their philosophical belief that students have diverse talents and ways of learning this passionate commitment to ensuring a positive learning environment is what makes them outstanding educational scholars

6759491 there was all kinds of madness going on and among all that chaos there was me in the sikworld booth this was a great opportunity for me to meet my fans as well as turn on a few new admirers the reactions and response was awesome to say the least now its time to prepare for next year

6759493 we decided to make passione piedi a non nude site to target a specific fetish niche that isnt covered that much on the web
6759494 being avid fans ourselves we realized that there was a definite lack of italian model foot sites available so we decided to fill that gap in the market ourselves
6759495 the non nude nature of the site has generated a lot of interest among the italian models weve been in contact with
6759496 we should be able to bring fans some beautiful and fresh faces to the niche girls who never would have appeared otherwise

6759615 i know my brother would never do anything like that
6759616 tough foreign policy that is neither republican nor democratic but is a strong smart american foreign policy to make our country more secure and advance our interests in the world
6759617 and john mccain should endorse president bushs efforts to oppose russias actions and form a bipartisan stand on this issue it is unfortunate that some of the candidates supporters are engaging in pointless criticism of each others public statements on the georgia crisis
6759618 it came out of a strategic review document that came out of the cfia and my department last fall

6759633 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6759634 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6759635 as the mccain campaign desperately tries to find out how many houses john mccain owns they are launching false and thoroughly debunked attacks
6759636 barack obama offered the best price of any bidder in the market for his home the only home he owns every dime of which he paid for himself
6759637 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses

6759640 you are getting a collateralized piece of paper at a significantly wider spread
6759641 sooner or later you have to follow words with actions
6759642 we are positioned in a conservative way in that there will be a successful resolution to this they the treasury will go from jawboning to actually acting somewhere within the mortgage markets probably via the gses in order to increase confidence
6759643 allow the gses to begin building their books once again instead of defending their books
6759644 i would venture to say that they want to protect as many current investors as they possibly could on all levels of the capital structure i just dont know what path they would choose
6759645 if they continue to address the issue by jawboning you have to deal with the fact that the real economy both domestic and outside the u s is slowing and continues to be pressed on the consumer base globally that will keep general levels of rates depressed for longer

6759650 it would be great to defend the fa cup i think that its a great competition
6759651 harry redknapp is a good manager and the fact that he told me he had confidence in me that was a big reason for me to come here
6759652 and portsmouth are a very good team they are in the uefa cup and thats great for the club
6759653 were delighted that armand has decided to join us for the season there were half a dozen other clubs interested in signing him on loan
6759654 hes strong and quick and a player that harry has admired since seeing him play for arsenals first team last season
6759655 i have no doubt that he has the ability of fabregas and nasri but he needs a stage to perform and prove this he can be as strong as obi mikel of chelsea but remember that he is still just a 16 year old boy
6759656 i cannot talk about the talks with arsenal but masal is happy that he is even being linked with this great football club
6759657 it plays football the beautiful way always moving always passing always running it is like the football he played as a child which is not too long ago so he cannot believe that this type of football can be played at the top level in europe
6759658 il premier parla di una riforma globale per andare incontro alle esigenze dei cittadini

6759661 la riforma della giustizia una priorit del paese e chiediamo al pd di condividere un testo che prenda spunto dalle idee di giovanni falcone e dal lavoro fatto dalla bicamerale presieduta da dalema

6759666 para ganhar fora o time tem que estar entrosado e n o o nosso caso mudamos demais no campeonato isso dificulta bastante
6759667 its just such an unfortunate situation to have the wpro brand tarnished this way
6759668 i feel sad for my friends there who are not part of this scandal
6759669 do i have sour grapes you bet but not for the station or for the warm people who welcomed me here the way local station management has mishandled this ratings scandal and me is not the wpro i had heard about for so many years
6759670 i love this theater and its so cool that its right here in mill valley
6759671 im going to do more obscure songs which i normally wouldnt do more acoustic type stuff
6759672 ill probably do i cant drive 55 maybe at the end but its not going to be me going up and doing all hits its more like me going up and being artsy fartsy
6759673 ephel duath s new work is fuckin awesome its the best example for intense precise and focused songwriting a very power and forceful statement of the band im very happy and proud to being part of this album
6759674 ephel duath is one of those bands that truly understand the essence of what experimental and fusion music should be about touring with them was an amazing experience and it is great to finally be collaborating in this way
6759675 i think i did an excellent job of showing the world how great bmx is
6759676 i crashed a lot and i came back from those crashes
6759677 i separated my shoulder once and i was laid up for three weeks
6759678 i cant imagine how much pain he was in today
6759679 bmxers can tell you all day why we think our sport belongs in the olympics
6759680 i raced bmx bikes when i was young so this reminds me of being a kid
6759681 its exciting to watch and its so much like boardercross
6759682 i think it is going to do for summer what snowboarding has done for the winter olympics give people a fresh new perspective and theres a lot of carnage
6759683 its been a long road this medal will be sleeping with me tonight
6759684 i can now announce that tom and i are expecting a baby and we are very happy

6759693 we experienced a lot of red tape and almost professional obstructionism from chinese authorities in the build up to the games the worst being when we were suddenly told that foreigners would not be allowed access to the building we are now using for our live studio overlooking the birds nest
6759694 that problem was finally overcome but only at the last minute and after a huge amount of effort by our beijing bureau
6759695 our studio then had a few visits from the police threatening to close us down just days before the games began because they suddenly decided we were too close to the stadium another hurdle we had to overcome
6759696 since then weve had nothing more than a few hands put in front of our lenses which is par for the course in china
6759697 we have been continually lied to it has got to the stage where people who ask tough questions of them are not allowed basically ignored when hands go up to ask any more
6759698 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6759699 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6759700 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6759701 we do not believe they were really interested in having people turn themselves in
6759702 you have captured the essence of my music and no ones ever done that before
6759703 melanie is over the moon at the prospect of becoming a mum for the first time

6759705 melanie loved being around their kids on the bands recent tour and is delighted shes now one of the gang
6759706 i love kids and one of the best bits about touring with the spice girls this time round was getting to know everyones babies im sure that babies will be part of my future
6759707 the off season pro athletes have one why dont you

6759709 mr gadd wants through me to say to you that he did not commit the offenses he was convicted of in vietnam
6759710 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6759711 he assaults the clerk with a caustic chemical probably pepper spray and from that point on this is a robbery the clerk runs around from the counter it appears that hes going to try to escape but instead he puts up his fists and puts up a fight with the suspect
6759712 the child was in shock it had stopped breathing now he has started breathing he has to stabilise we have put him on oxygen and glucose the incubator too will help but i really wish they had brought him on the first day he has been sick for three days and they brought him here on the third day

6759717 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
6759718 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
6759719 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
6759720 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
6759721 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
6759722 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
6759723 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
6759724 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production
6759725 if the rbi increases interest rates by another 0 5 percent then i will be paying interest at the rate of 13 25 percent
6759726 at 12 25 percent my home loan tenure has increased to 447 months a huge increase of 207 months it was 240 months in 2004 despite paying emis for more than 36 months now
6759727 if i can save at least 50 percent of the interest that i am currently paying and make some sensible investment decisions like putting the amount in my ppf account i will still earn 8 to 8 5 percent interest on it along with the tax benefit that i will get under section 80c
6759728 if interest rates continue to grow at this rate then i will be the owner of a 600 sq ft area after approximately 37 years

6759730 many of the attacks that have come from john mccains campaign have been quite frankly condescending
6759731 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more
6759732 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
6759733 like a lot of teachers there now i figured how bad could it be i was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005
6759734 i became very very sick my immune system shut down i collapsed and was bedridden for several months
6759735 i wouldnt have kids in the school if i didnt think it was safe i would close the school
6759736 i do think there are areas of that school that continue to be dangerous
6759737 you can go most anyplace and build a school on top of a superfund site
6759738 they can build a school anywhere they want really and thats the sad truth i think at schools very little has changed and thats unfortunate
6759739 the children would actually pick up these chemicals and handle them
6759740 so for example one of these things was phosphorous rocks phosphorous rocks were little pieces of chemical residue that would bubble up to the surface the children would pick up these phosphorous rocks and when you threw them at a hard surface they would explode like a firecracker
6759741 i have a high school education i dont have a science degree but you dont have to be a scientist to know that 20 000 tons of chemicals and kindergartners dont mix
6759742 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6759743 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6759744 basing a workers exposure on 45 years on the job is an archaic workplace model
6759745 conflict of interest could arise when an employer with a self funded benefit plan e g a self insured health plan also acts as the claims administrator for the plan
6759746 the supreme court held that such potential conflicts of interest could in certain circumstances result in less judicial deference to a claims administrators interpretation of a benefit claim if that claim is ever litigated

6759760 originally we anticipated 200 students participating in master the mainframe however we ended up having more than 450 students sign up for the event
6759761 this demonstrates the continued interest in mainframe computing particularly in an it environment where there is a lot of pressure to consolidate and reduce space the mainframe is a great platform in terms of scale performance and energy efficiency
6759762 i took part in this contest because it provided me with a challenge
6759763 i liked part 3 of the contest as it involved lots of different technologies and things that can be done using ibm mainframes such as issuing unix commands executing java classes etc which were totally new to me i really enjoyed it

6759808 no that is not true we have not pulled out of the champions trophy but we have advised the icc about our considerable concern and we have made sure that they understand that we will not go anywhere which is not safe we are waiting to hear from them later this evening
6759809 ca at this stage hasnt made any official decision to not tour we are waiting to hear from icc the ball is in their court
6759810 we are very willing to tour pakistan we are very keen to do so and we will visit pakistan as long as the safety and security advisors say that it is safe
6759811 the only issue that is important for us is the safety and security of the players and the advice we get from our range of sources
6759812 we are aware of south africas decision but we will comment only after discussing various aspects of the issue during the icc board teleconference on sunday
6759813 we are deeply disappointed and when a decision was to be made on sunday we think south africa made a hasty choice
6759814 now its up to the icc to take a decision but i would say south africas refusal will badly hurt the event we will still do our best to save the event and host it on schedule
6759815 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6759816 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6759817 we appreciate all the efforts of the icc task team the pcb the pakistan authorities and the security consultants
6759818 the players are naturally disappointed for their fans and the people of pakistan that they will not have a chance to see them in action in that country in september

6759824 ultimate goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6759825 what were trying to do is to put together an agreement that protects our people that respects iraqi sovereignty that allows us to lay the kind of foundation that we need for making certain that we complete the work that weve all sacrificed so greatly to see accomplished and that work is being accomplished
6759826 grocery list id like to see more than one format for this list and or at least the option to export a csv file format so i can reformat to a preferred list structure my wife prefers a list that has a separator for each section of the grocery store vs just a listing with the section displayed together this tends to bundle the whole list together and makes it harder to follow when in the store
6759827 in another business ive evaluated web based asp software and would be happy to be a beta tester of your new web based premium system if when appropriate ive also spent some time combing the web for other products and havent seen anything that i think is really worthy however during the process ive come up with some pretty good ideas
6759828 were in the business of growing the linux platform and making sure the development process of linux is maintained in a way that is productive and safe
6759829 one of the things that make linux work as a development project is the fact that linus torvalds who is the final decision maker on the release of the kernel works at a place that is not one of the competitors that collaborates on the project
6759830 the foundation is a perfect place for people to come together on projects that are difficult long require coordination and arent necessarily strategic from a competitive point of view so vendors want to share the cost
6759831 everyone just has a different approach and they cant agree on just one its really just an issue of discipline within the industry and the community
6759832 im not the cop here on this stuff and i would rather see community members coming to a rough consensus rather than us saying what to do
6759833 weve expanded the board to be more participatory and opened up seats for community members
6759834 we have more board level representation from smaller organizations and the ability to be on our board is much more affordable than it was under the osdl
6759835 my goal in the organization is to diversify our revenues so we have a broad base of representation
6759836 so no single entity dominates the organization and i think weve achieved that
6759837 they serve a great purpose in bringing together the community commercial linux companies and end users and they represent the interests of each group very well we have a very close relationship with jim and were very pleased with the direction hes taken the linux foundation
6759838 they the linux foundation try to stay neutral and not assume they are the ones owning development
6759839 in general they have done a good job at trying to get companies to provide specifications and legal assistance to developers in general from what we can see the development community is neutral to positive about the linux foundation

6759886 design emerged during the industrial revolution before then an artisan labored by hand to produce an object whose outline was set by tradition but whose final form varied according to imperfect materials minor accidents in working with materials and a customers wishes an artisans intention moved from minds eye through hands motion to the shaping of a physical object this simple process involving minute variations in oft repeated motions under the intuitive direction of a single individual yielded to a more complex process when the factory replaced the workshop when production of a series of nearly identical objects replaced the fashioning of unique artifacts the task of planning and conceiving work was separated from the task of carrying it out an new type of worker the designer devised two dimensional patterns or three dimensional prototypes to be copied by other workers using precise machines

6759889 yesterday mccain was asked again what do you think about the economy he says well i think the economy is fundamentally strong said the economy is fundamentally strong
6759890 so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6759891 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6759892 theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6759893 you dont have to be a nobel prize laureate economist you just have to have a little bit of a sense of what ordinary people are going through to understand that we cant afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the same failed economic policies that george bush has put in place
6759894 one of the things ive heard that makes me laugh the most is some who would suggest that a vote for the senator might be risky
6759895 let me tell you want risk is when the economy the inflation number in june is the highest its been in 27 years the unemployment rate jacking back up energy prices where they are deficit when the economy is that front and center thing that all americans are so concerned about right now to put someone in the white house who says i dont know much about the economy that is risky folks thats what sen mccain said and thats risky
6759896 let me tell you want risk is when the economy the inflation number in june is the highest its been in 27 years the unemployment rate jacking back up energy prices where they are deficit

6759902 sen john mccain has all but closed the gap with sen barack obama underscoring how international crises and some well placed negative ads have boosted the prospects of the republican presidential candidate
6759903 also points to a big challenge for sen obama as his party gathers in denver next week for its convention rallying sen hillary clintons supporters to his cause only half of those who voted for sen clinton in the primaries say they are now supporting sen obama one in five is supporting sen mccain the republican has reached out to clinton supporters by offering steady praise for the former first lady and hinting that hed be open to a running mate who supports abortion rights
6759904 the poll has some cautionary notes for sen mccain as well it shows that his supporters are much less enthusiastic than sen obamas and finds widespread concern among voters about his age
6759905 the poll suggested that victory remains very much within the grasp of both men as the marathon presidential race enters its most decisive period still the poll showed troubling signs for mr mccain who continues to suffer from a wide gap in enthusiasm mr obamas supporters were twice as likely to describe themselves as enthusiastic as mr mccains were only 24 percent of mr mccains supporters called themselves enthusiastic 28 percent said that they were supporting him only because he was the republican partys probable nominee or because they disliked mr obama
6759906 there were indications that the more negative tone mr mccain adopted this summer could prove risky efforts by republicans and mr mccains campaign to cast his opponent as elitist or out of touch do not seem to have moved popular opinion much against mr obama but they appear to have led more voters to view mr mccain as a negative campaigner

6759911 well sure of course it was x when the two met at such and such it was obvious
6759912 even after she ended her presidential bid back in june perhaps we should have guessed that this presidential contest or at least the convention was still going to be about the clintons
6759913 mccain is on vacation in sedona az though the weekend
6759914 but the biggest reason why this race remains close in this dem leaning political environment is because of obamas inability to close the deal with some of clintons supporters

6759962 ik ben benieuwd of ruttes groenrechtse koersverandering zie de opening van trouw vandaag meer wordt dan een poging de huidige vvd een lichtgroen strikje te geven de term groenrechts bevat immers een innerlijke tegenstrijdigheid want echte groene politiek vereist een flinke herverdeling van welvaart tussen hoge en lage inkomens en tussen grote en kleine bedrijven
6759963 grote energieintensieve bedrijven en mensen met een hoog inkomen zijn veruit de grootste vervuilers ten onrechte betalen zij daarvoor een veel te lage prijs en souperen zij de milieugebruiksruimte op van mensen met de laagste inkomens in binnen amp buitenland ook een forse herverdeling tussen mobiliteit per auto en per openbaar vervoer is onontkoombaar uiteraard hoop ik dat de vvd niet alleen in woord maar ook in daad afscheid neemt van haar verleden als grijze asfaltpartij met spanning wacht ik de nieuwe concrete maatregelen van mark rutte af om de uitwassen van onze hyperconsumptie te keren en zal ik iedere nieuwe stap naar links toejuichen tot slot dank ik hem voor zijn poging meer aandacht voor klimaat amp milieuproblemen te vragen en ben ik hem erkentelijk voor het vergroten van onze naamsbekendheid
